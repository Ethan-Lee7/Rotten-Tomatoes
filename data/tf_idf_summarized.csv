0,chicken_run,its plump chickens maintain that strange  haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them  it coaxes you to laugh and cry  flatters your intelligence  and practically guarantees a cheap night out  at dinner afterward  no one s going to be ordering anything but salad  apart from looking like no other type of animated film  chicken run stands alone in its unwavering determination not to play down to the kiddies  chicken run isn t just chock full of references to classic prison break movies and some witty inside hollywood jokes  but is filled with a secret ingredient sadly missing from its super digitized  merchandise driven counterparts  heart  it is not only an amazing technical accomplishment  it s also the wittiest and best voiced animated movie to come along in years  chicken run boasts the most delicious collection of desperately funny brits since the full monty  poultry has never been so stuffed with personality  exactly the picker upper this macho movie summer needs  it d be churlish to carp about this triumph of craftsmanlike technique  the poultry cast are capable of an extraordinary range of expression  especially during the sad or mildly scary scenes  fans of the more subversive wallace and gromit tales are almost bound to be somewhat disappointed by this safer  more mainstream effort  
1,the_taste_of_others,succeeds with believable characters and situations born of lives well studied  there are some things the french do better than we do  and the small movie is one  a worldly wise  compassionate and charmingly acted gallic comedy  confirms that france may be producing  per capita  more good films than any country on the globe  an exemplary ensemble piece  with a script as warm  witty and insightful as the performances  diff rent strokes isn t an original theme  but in the hands of so capable an ensemble it takes on unexpected poignance  rich with gentle humor and insight  the characters prove to be engaging and their quite real human emotions are enough to carry it  will entertain and provoke  and leave a flavorful memory behind  rich with vivid characters and revelations about the illogical yet human ways in which we crash and intersect  like an eric rohmer film  but with a bit more breeziness and youth to it  jaoui s directing and sympathy are what hold us from the start  one of the delights of the taste of others is that it is so smart and wears its intelligence lightly  for everyone who has ever asked   what on earth do they see in each other   
2,yi_yi,this intimate family portrait peels away layer after layer of unspoken truth and hidden life  full of nice small moments that add up to a deeper whole  
3,memento,i can t remember when a movie has seemed so clever  strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time  nolan pulls off this complicated narrative structure with great flair  
4,the_life_and_times_of_hank_greenberg,writer director aviva kempner crafted this love letter to greenberg by imaginatively weaving interviews with great footage from newsreels and feature films  
5,you_can_count_on_me,unusually sharp editing is the first hint that in fact it s a superior  acutely observed comedy drama about family ties and the struggle to find a sense of purpose  even managing to work in some genuinely metaphysical intimations  few films have explored the complicated bonds of love and resentment between brother and sister with such delightful honesty  some of its best moments are so painfully familiar that their overall theatricality is easily forgiven  i never thought i would say this  but i am starting to think that laura linney may  in fact  be a very good actress  this funny and involving film presents its well drawn characters to us pretty much the way we would encounter them in life  thoroughly modest in its means and ambition  you can count on me is one of the best pictures i ve seen all year  a little movie concealing surprisingly big emotions  the characters in you can count on me have been freed from the formulas of fiction and set loose to live lives where they screw up  learn from their mistakes and bumble hopefully into the future  gives us not so much a slice of reality as a big picture window  polished and gleaming  through which we can see things that matter  with warm humor and perceptive writing  director kenneth lonergan displays a gift for creating realistic characters and a compelling story  a subtle and often surprising study of the relationship between damaged adult siblings  full of mordant humor and dramatic invention  a pleasant motion picture  offering a solid evening s worth of entertainment  
6,1103281-traffic,i don t see this slightly better than average drug thriller  with slightly better than average direction by steven soderbergh  as anything more than a routine rubber stamping of genre reflexes  walk straight and steady into steven soderbergh s dizzying drug drama traffic and minutes later you ll feel as woozy as if you had fallen into one of wonderland s smokiest sinkholes  
7,best_in_show,guest seems to know just how far he can stretch reality without losing the crucial texture of verisimilitude  this is a comedy even cat lovers might adore  hilarious and offbeat  but humor is pretty grownup     it s always a pleasure to watch this ensemble of gifted talents do what they do best    be spontaneous and funny and surprising  what we get is a master class demonstration of the distinction between comic actors and comedians who try to act  what a pity that with such funny material  guest and company found it necessary to rely so heavily on sex as a supplementary source of comedy  the jokes in best in show are somewhat one dimensional  but they hit their target  improv comedy rarely makes it onto the big screen  and when it does so as hilariously as it does in best in show     that is certainly cause for celebration  the movie is light as a lap dog  and often just as lovable  fans of offbeat humor will get a big kick out of this follow up to waiting for guffman  but there will be more appreciative   oh  that s funny   comments than outright laughs  you come away wishing that guest could deliver a new mockumentary not every so often but every year  the film s bite is as toothsome as its bark  it creates one comic character for the ages  guffman veteran fred willard as addled  veteran  loose lipped  sex obsessed sports tv commentator buck laughlin  this giggle does for dog shows what     rob reiner s this is spinal tap did for heavy metal  
8,croupier,script and direction play safe throughout  clive owen conveys a sharp  cynical intelligence that rolls off the screen in waves whenever he widens his glittering blue eyes  
9,not_one_less,this thematic  lesson  is served up with non didactic grace complemented by tiny bursts of humour  for chinese viewers  this film will play as a human drama  for western viewers  there s almost equal interest at the edges of the screen  in the background  in the locations and incidental details that show daily life in today s china  it s an excellent movie for kids  because it is about how amazing children can be  zhang has constructed another startling showcase for a woman under siege that stands nicely beside ju dou or shanghai triad  with not one less  zhang yimou has fashioned what feels like an uncannily accurate portrait of a culture where communist ideology has vanished like a brief dream  as traditional community values clash with the burgeoning cult of money  the chinese director zhang yimou has a rare gift for dramatizing highly theatrical stories in highly naturalistic settings  this is the kind of intelligent  probing picture where you get the chance to absorb every detail of the girl s experience  and the director s reserved approach exerts a strong  hypnotic hold  in many ways  not one less resembles the socialist realist dramas of the early communist regimes  but zhang has something smarter and more amusing up his sleeve  
10,1095420-high_fidelity,created a doggedly faithful adaptation of nick hornby s cult fave novel  it s hard to remember the last time guys were nailed so perceptively and dragged into adulthood so warmly and entertainingly  
11,dark_days,this is the world discovered and illuminated by gonzo documentarian marc singer  who spent a good part of two years living with and chronicling the lives of a half dozen tunnel dwellers for his remarkable first film  dark days the lives of these people inside their shacks are full of surprises as well as grim confirmations  but the things we don t know about them also significantly shape our experience of the film  singer deserves credit for attempting to put a human face on such tragic circumstances  but he appears to have gotten so close to his main subjects that he seems unwilling to make them  or their desperate situation  look too bad  some of these hardy souls have lived this way for years  decades even  and they ve lived not just to tell the tale but to suggest that they ve created a viable alternative existence  at times  dark days almost makes you envious  but only almost  revealing  if occasionally frustrating  singer s stark black and white photography renders their world with the abstract horror of a german expressionist film  yet he s equally skilled at coaxing the grim personal stories of life underground  designed neither to warm your heart nor shelter you in the comfort of liberal guilt  the movie does what so many style conscious   subjective  documentaries have long forgotten how to do  it shows you a world  and stays the hell out of it  singer achieves remarkable intimacy with his subjects  who share their experiences and joke around with the man behind the camera as freely as they do with their peers  it s distinguished by remarkable intimacy  with none of the arty distance or aesthetic pretension a veteran filmmaker might have imposed  singer s subjects feel more like collaborators  an ensemble cast  complemented by its black and white photography and a moody dj shadow score  this is a gritty yet often tender look at society s margins  marc singer s feted 2000 doc about a manhattan subterranean community has lost none of its power since its debut  
12,filth_and_the_fury,best for older teens  especially sex pistols fans  to see this film s footage from the  70s is to see the beginning of much of pop and fashion iconography for the next two decades  
13,almost_famous,in almost famous  writer director crowe is still contending with the dueling voices in his head  and he still can t bring himself to take the harsh road  his movie gives off the warm glow of mercy  the film shimmers with the irresistible pleasures that define hollywood at its best    it s polished like glass  funny  knowing and bright  and filled with characters whose lives are invariably sexier and more purposeful than our own  a winner because crowe dares to wear his heart on his sleeve  for this movie at least  he s with the band  even though the same points are made more than once  they are never less than entertaining  while crowe resists the lazy route of plastering the soundtrack with 70s rock hits  these characters have none of the passion and incipient mania that made jerry maguire    or john cusack s lloyd dobler in crowe s debut say anything    so engaging  it offers the kind of top notch entertainment that has been sadly lacking in multiplexes this year  a sweet but curiously unfulfilling story  oh  what a lovely film  i was almost hugging myself while i watched it  crowe has created a genuine love song for all those who ve ever felt their lives to have been saved by rock   roll  penny lane  is  played by hudson with an intuitive lucidity that recalls the best work of her mother  goldie hawn  see it and it ll stay with you as your own memories do  funny  poignant  bittersweet and irreplaceable  
14,cast_away,hanks s everyman quality has never been more aptly utilized  he s the perfect stand in for all of us who never made it to eagle scout  chuck has flashes of ingenuity that filled me with the thrill of discovery and invention  and stretches of failure that i felt just as acutely  hanks conducts a master class in acting by showing a man losing his sense of himself in fractional gradations  hanks and his collaborators deserve all the praise and awards that surely will come their way  if you ve seen the trailer or the commercials  you know the story  but that doesn t mean you ve seen the movie  
15,girlfight,if you don t think of marlon brando s smoldering power at some point during girlfight  karyn kusama s splendid debut film about a young female boxer  you ve probably never seen brando perform  
16,1104207-panic,a gently subversive outing full of nicely limned characters  the results are quietly electrifying  radiates quiet and calm  while simmering with tension both comic and tragic  a defiantly offbeat and accomplished piece with a dream ensemble acting out one man s nightmare  both subtle and formidably odd  and already you can feel an enthusiastic cult following forming  panic offers a more naturalistic analysis of male midlife crisis than the grotesquely overpraised american beauty  mr  bromell s shrewdness in constructing narrative is a bit more advanced than his directing skills  but he has worked out panic intelligently and supported his script with an able cast  there has never been an evocation of middle aged disappointment like it  there s a sense that the picture wants to constantly stick its tongue in its cheek but never wants to get caught at it  once you ve seen the first hour  there s really no need to sit through the rest  since almost everything that transpires during the final thirty minutes is easily predicted by anyone who understands the conventional storyline handbook  
17,widow_of_st_pierre,a work of art that immerses you in a time and place so completely that it could be a documentary  a compelling french canadian drama  rides a romantic spirit that would have fit splendidly in a classic hollywood production  leconte lets the widow of st  pierre resonate in ways that transcend its black and white scenario  devastatingly tragic  it s a relief to see leconte leaning more toward dostoyevsky than dior for a change  binoche gets a chance to demonstrate her on screen radiance with subtlety and amplitude  rendered with impeccable beauty and dramatic precision  faraldo s most engrossing and inventive script  alternately serious and comic  is beautifully realized by binoche  auteuil and kusturica  
18,sexy_beast,i didn t know kingsley had such notes inside him  obviously  he can play anyone  
19,aimee_and_jaguar,a sophisticated and beautiful feature debut from german television director max frberbck  rewarding viewing  evocatively re creating a narrative milieu and war time berlin rarely seen on screen  a reminder that truth never ceases to be stranger than fiction  its series of quiet but moving realizations of the utter ubiquity of the nazi horror in every single aspect of life  even something as hidden as a sexual sub culture  is powerful indeed  there is surprisingly little emotional amplitude  frberbck s adaptation relies on the hefty talents of its two leading ladies  
20,wattstax,the cinema verite material is very cunningly incorporated with the festival coverage of many major black rock activities to make an overall rhythmic pat  tern full of life and vigour  a time when not only a single record company could put together a day like this  but could then give every dollar made to charity  it just has the air of something too carefully laid out in advance  it s so busy being glossy and optimistic that it doesn t even allow its performers time to create on screen a measure of the excitement they might have created in person  
21,exorcist_the_version_youve_never_seen,there s something elemental about the exorcist  even with the new hopeful ending that betrays the bleak original  there is no doubting this is a traumatic film  but whether or not you enjoy it will depend on what you re looking for  in an era when many films compete to scare the hell out of you  the exorcist remains one of the few able to successfully scare the hell into you  a feat which assuredly deserves another go round  decades later  only some parts will scare the pants off you    but it s those parts that make this a scary trip that s very definitely worth taking again  the new version s amendments  for the most part  are distracting and sometimes unintentionally funny  no matter how many times viewed  the exorcist never fails to deliver the goods  remains an effective excursion into demonic possession more than a quarter of a century after it was first unveiled to the public  it s still a shock to see how young linda blair was  it is regan s nymphet innocence  of course  that renders her subsequent ravings so obscene  a triumph of dramatic construction as well as special effects  the scares were sometimes cheap  but they weren t stupid  still delivers on the most visceral level  an expertly tuned movie  
22,emperors_new_groove,emperor doesn t aim too high or strain too hard  it is at ease inhabiting its pretty  miniature realm  an audience dominated by young children was disconcertingly quiet during a preview screening  
23,meet_the_parents,scenes that should have been uproarious are weaker than many of the movie s smaller moments  whose everyday humor isn t specific to the plot or characters  star driven comedy at times offensive and funny  alas  poor focker  he can t help himself  and we can t help ourselves from falling about  equally helpless  at this superbly antic movie  when the script puts its faith in the audience  allowing us to find the laughs on our own  the film is irresistible  a bright lark  yet when the writers panic  upping the antic volume and shifting into crazed sitcom gear  the lark stops  a hilarious hodgepodge of the in laws and annie hall  in which de niro gives his best comic performance to date  a refreshing change from the current trend of gross and grosser humor  within its formulaic confines  the humor works uncommonly well from time to time  with all due respect to giggles  though  you would do better to rent raging bull  passable movie entertainment  but like most future in laws leaves a feeling of something still desired  even with stiller and de niro  meet the parents is an encounter that can be postponed until it s available on video  possibly the most amusing mainstream live action comedy since there s something about mary   roach  does know how to stage discrete comic moments  taking mildly humorous nightmares and turning them into nicely wrought miniatures  
24,erin_brockovich,in the title role  roberts carries the film in the best sense  by taking us on a human journey of genuine discovery and growth  julia roberts winner  r mostly for language  erin is far and away her own worst enemy   and a good thing too  because she needed at least one  from the opening to the perfect final shot  roberts is in nearly every scene of erin brockovich  and there isn t a second when we re not on her side  i found myself surprisingly engaged  roberts does what the best movie stars do  she makes you believe in erin brockovich as a living  breathing human being even as you re also constantly aware that you re watching julia roberts on screen  it s a victory for julia roberts  co star albert finney and director steven soderbergh  it s also a victory for the audience  a stand up and cheer crowd pleaser  there is never a dull moment  with erin brockovich   soderbergh  pulls off his most impressive feat yet  giving crowd pleasing baubles a good name  not only is every plot development signaled far in advance  but nearly every scene in the film s long second section rings a variation of one of two themes  1  julia roberts tells somebody off  or 2  julia roberts feels somebody s pain  before long  the character simply becomes irritating  
25,battle_royale,stylistically it s a beauty  with khaki uniformed waifs fighting for their lives to a crashing classical score  3d conversion of a classic teen massacre thriller raises the gore level  maybe battle royale s ultimate punchline is its inexplicable ability to fool some people into taking it seriously  departing from two decades  worth of domestic and personal dramas and returning to his roots as japan s maestro of mayhem  kinji fukasaku has delivered a brutal punch to the collective solar plexus with one of his most outrageous and timely films  a minor sensation in japan where questions were asked in parliament  this noisy and bombastic adaptation of a recent pulp novel doesn t shape up as satire or death sport fantasy  races along with the swift  brutal precision of a samurai sword cutting through cotton  
26,billy_elliot,terrific story of young ballet dancer has strong language  its dry humor  earthy performances and distinctive take on the clash between art and life help it earn every tear and cheer  neither revolutionary in its approach or subject matter nor seamless in its storytelling  billy elliot nevertheless manages to sketch the lives of characters we come to care about  
27,state_and_main,intriguing characters  good movie for older teens  hollywood corrupts absolutely  and mamet turns the toxic process into the year s best and smartest comedy  state and main might be the perfect david mamet movie for people who don t like david mamet movies  the nice thing about it  though  is that it won t disappoint the rest of us  an amusing trifle  a surfeit of farce and fast talking makes up for a lack of plot  as much fun to listen to as it is to watch  mamet has an unrivaled ear for dialogue  has the hermetic  vacuum packed atmosphere of all the films that david mamet has directed  yet cleverness  heightened to a pitch of acid tongued amorality  is both its flavor and its meaning  in this age when dumb  broad  easy to market comedy continues to rule  mr  mamet s literary wit is always welcome  a frequently hilarious film  there s not much here that would surprise any knowledgeable observer  but mamet presents it with such brio and simmering rage that the movie has the sting of anger in almost every scene  when mamet s new movie sticks to depicting the contagious amorality spread by the movie business  it s darkly dirty fun  a finely tuned satire of the insane hollywood modus operandi  heightened by farcical flourishes and grounded with the kind of reportorial integrity that distinguishes mamet s best work  
28,nico_and_dani,filmmaker gay nimbly navigates the raging waters of burgeoning sexuality  for a movie that has been praised for its sensitive realism  nico and dani takes some large liberties  could be useful to a confused teenager  suggesting that we all have to choose our own paths in life  although films about adolescents stumbling urgently toward sexual self identity are plentiful  most are put to shame by the delicacy  poignancy  and honesty of nico and dani  the film seems unfocused at times  but on reflection  stands out as an unusually sensitive and honest view of teen sexuality  straight or gay  one of the better recent contributions to an over crowded field  gay deftly explores the casual experimentation between the two boys  a refreshingly frank treatment of some terribly overworked territory  succeeds in capturing and sustaining the fragile emotional climate of curiosity  fear  innocence and prurience that surrounds adolescent sexual experimentation  a movie more interested in shocking than in entertaining  
29,xmen,the x men comic books have spawned a cottage industry of mutant characters  and the movie helps make sense of these legions while offering the established fan base something new to cheer  the movie is respectful of its source material without being the least bit self important  x men may have hit the platonic ideal of comic book movies  coming across as lightweight  sophisticated  wacky and straightforward all at the same time  the script could be a lot snappier  particularly during some virtually unexplained rivalry banter between marsden and jackman  but x men is a decent start to what will no doubt be an immensely profitable series of negligible but enjoyable summer movies  of course  the wide open ending practically shrieks  sequel   so rest assured this is only the beginning of a new super franchise  here s hoping joel schumacher doesn t get his hands on it  x men plays like a so so middle chapter of an epic series rather than a fitting kickoff  apart from the brushed metal production design and pin sharp camerawork  this offers only moderate excitement  all these characters with their odd powers are inherently absurd and they throw a barrel of wrenches into the machinery of a coherent narrative  a distinctively absorbing entertainment  offering just enough popcorn thrills for mass audiences and just enough chewiness for hardcore sci fi fans  it sucks that this choppily edited film appears rushed and incoherent in ways that cheat the story of its human resonance and the stunts of their anticipated pow  one must give credit for the film s cheeky attitude to director bryan singer  visually entertaining  
30,nurse_betty,almost every emotion and action on view is presented as false  idiotic or superficial  while nurse betty proves that labute has more than one string to his bow  you can t help thinking that he makes more memorable cinema when revelling in misanthropy  does labute feel any sympathy for his victimized women  or merely contempt for their weakness  this fantasy tinged romance leaves a distinctly bitter aftertaste  its uneven comedy may leave moviegoers yearning for the confidently choreographed banter and moral sludge that marked labute s previous outings  
31,thirteen_days,an outstanding movie for families with older kids  a fitting dramatic tribute to the deadly brinksmanship that pulled us back from the edge during the most volatile two weeks of the cold war  who would ve thought this nearly 40 year old piece of history could be turned into such a riveting motion picture  thirteen days is more suspenseful than the car crashes and breathless chases of most run of the mill action movies  shrewd and tender in equal measure  thirteen days is an insider drama par excellence  i call the movie a thriller  even though the outcome is known  because it plays like one  people will be watching thirteen days long after journalism s junkyard dogs have gone snapping after other prey  thirteen days sustains a pretty good boil for a movie that s basically a series of scenes of middle aged white guys shouting at each other  it s a slick  efficient thriller that keeps driving forward lucidly and relentlessly  thirteen days will make you shudder  but only in ways the filmmakers intended  director roger donaldson s taut  understated thriller pulls you into a powerfully engaging situation  it s never as fully engaging as you might hope  
32,chunhyangdyun_2000,admiration gives way to something like enthrallment  be patient and you ll see that this picture casts its own peculiar spell  
33,shadow_of_the_vampire,vampire satire has some creepy moments  the screenplay  by steven katz  suffers from arch  almost unspeakably theatrical dialogue  and  as murnau  john malkovich recites his lines as if monomania were synonymous with monotonic  he drains the drama of blood  wholly absorbing and inspired in parts  this carefully crafted curio dares to suggest that murnau made a faustian pact with an actual vampire to play the title role in exchange for the neck of the film s leading lady at production s end  it s a marvelous  resonant joke that never quite succeeds  stretches of the film resemble a dario argento horrorfest crossed with a mel brooks spoof  any film that has not just dafoe but also malkovich  kier  late of paul morrissey s warhol produced blood for dracula  no less   and cross dressing brit comic izzard is bound to be interesting  this stupid and demeaning fantasy about the shooting of f w  murnau s 1922 masterpiece nosferatu is a piece of postmodernist kitsch whose only redeeming quality is an enjoyably over the top  eye rolling performance by willem dafoe  this in reference fest for frightfilm fans has enough chuckles and shudders even for those who ve never heard of nosferatu  it makes some good points  but ultimately just stops rather than ends  a shockingly funny spellbinder  dafoe brings a terrifying realism to a character long steeped in mystery  works as a horror flick because merhige is so adept at establishing an unsettling atmosphere and because dafoe s performance is so powerfully perverse  dafoe s boundary pushing yet calibrated performance will crack you up  
34,chuck_and_buck,this weirdly comic film strips off the gloss of youthful beauty to explore the darker side of childhood and ask what happens when the wilful  needy child within refuses to grow up  
35,original_kings_of_comedy,there are some good gags and routines here  but loads of them have been done with far more invention and wit by richard pryor and eddie murphy  they form a hilarious and even poignant conscience for a brand of black humor much deeper and wiser than what we ve seen on screen this year  boasts the highest laughs per minute ratio of any in this season s hilarity  
36,merci_pour_le_chocolat,we can rejoice that he carries on  breathes his profession as his native air  makes pictures of varying quality but persistently makes them  a tasty appetizer that leaves you wanting more  merci pour le chocolat has a restraint and rigor that we don t see in commercial american films  the kind that a director creates when he has no interest in sentimentality or in soliciting the audience s favor  a sun drenched masterpiece  part parlor game  part psychological case study  part droll social satire  huppert gives what may be her wittiest passive aggressive performance yet  suspend your disbelief here and now  or you ll be shaking your head all the way to the credits  huppert has the best poker face since buster keaton  she faces the camera with detached regard  inviting us to imagine what she is thinking  in his 48th film of his 44 year career  new wave pioneer chabrol remains at the height of his powers  the picture belongs to ms  mouglalis  whose adorable warmth doesn t lessen her instinct to exploit  every potential twist is telegraphed well in advance  every performance respectably muted  the movie itself seems to have been made under the influence of rohypnol  claude chabrol s camera has a way of gently swaying back and forth as it cradles its characters  veiling tension beneath otherwise tender movements  
37,ghost_dog_the_way_of_the_samurai,a handsomely shot  cool sounding head scratcher of a film that probably isn t worth the wear on the fingernails  too whimsically staged to take as serious suspense  too grimly real to be amusing  jarmusch  with his noble sincerity and real affection  can t begin to give this grisly  somnambulant essay on the cross cultural matrix of violence born of over stimulation and numbness a life of its own  
38,love_and_basketball,one wishes producer spike lee had stepped in to give the dialogue some sass  
39,beau_travail,as much poem as film  it requires patience  which it rewards at every languid turn  beau travail is an allegorical tale of revenge and jealousy set within a french foreign legion outpost in africa  a masterpiece  denis  film is as fluid as her nine others  demonstrating her skill at integrating story strands with her handsome visual sense and gift for evocation  
40,1097991-george_washington,george washington is the closest thing we have to william faulkner on screen it remembers a summer that was not a happy summer  but there will never again be a summer so intensely felt  so alive  so valuable  
41,wonder_boys,while maguire s blank shapelessness has left a hole in the center of other films  here he delivers a real performance rather than just his wide eyed presence  wonders really never cease  glad to have been invited along  
42,house_of_mirth,besides his remarkable ability to render a profound sense of past in all his films  davies can uncannily map out the emotions of his characters via his mise en scene  davies breathes fresh air through the wax museum corridors of the costume drama by finding behind all that stiff spined pomp and circumstance the most venal of impulses  what we re talking about here could hardly be described as a tableau vivant  i can t recall another movie that cries out so incessantly for running commentary  
43,gladiator,really excellent but really violent oscar winner  
44,lakeboat,based on mamet s experience as a freighter on the great lakes while a grad english lit student  mantegna s screen version is so dramatically inert and artistically shapeless resulting in an uninvolving memory film  watching it  you come to understand what it is that mamet has been true to all these years  a first rate movie made from one of david mamet s lesser plays  where mantegna succeeds is in providing a forum for some great acting  as with any mamet script  the cast is all  and these old boys take his macho monologues and make them sound like homer  more play than movie  but it s unusual for either  it s neither plot driven like many plays nor action  and image driven like most movies  the raw raunch and the latent yearning and pain  mamet  sets down here with such assurance yield a movie of special rewards  the script is so inherently stagy that setting the film on a real boat doesn t pay off  i once taught a class on mamet s films  i wish i could have opened it with this one  because for mamet  it all starts here  this early effort is more a curiosity piece than anything else  an elegiac and tartly amusing tribute to a group of guys trying to make the most of the hand life has dealt them  
45,requiem_for_a_dream,at times disturbing and always intense  this flick offers its own acid trip for viewers and is a first hand look at four people who become trapped by their own hell  burnished camerawork and ex pop will eat itself head mansell s part punchy  part elegiac score reinforce and counterpoint the increasingly nightmarish visuals  
46,shanghai_noon,much of its strength comes from the central clash between jackie s indomitable energy and wilson s knowingly anachronistic cool  while lots of visual and verbal gags keep things whistling  it s hard to imagine why anyone of any age would find other elements of this movie s attempt at a comic text even mildly amusing  far too much time passes between good punches and punch lines  the typical machinations of an event movie dictate multiple overblown climaxes that leave one less than bowled over  the plots for most chan movies are glorified coat hangers on which to drape elaborate fights and sight gags  shanghai noon is slightly more sophisticated  but it still treats plot twists and peripheral characters as impositions  
47,fantasia_2000,delightful  but may scare more sensitive kids  the rest of these animated sequences depend on gimmickry  cuteness  or facile ideology  fantasia 2000 will no doubt become a disney perennial  but that does not by definition make it a classic  it provides some fine artists the chance to stretch and frolic  even as it reminds today s audiences of animation s limitless borders  this must be the most belated sequel the movies have produced  it s not that the images aren t pretty  or that great care hasn t gone into them    it s that the sensibility behind them is so icky  limited in its conception of beauty to picture postcards and the sort of paintings you see in chain hotels  sixty years after walt disney s animators first set cartoons to classical music  they ve conjured up seven new sequences for fantasia 2000  judging from the often mickey mouse results  they may have been too hasty  where else can you see perlman s hair in such stunning details  find donald duck as a major character in a bible story and experience the distinctive mixture of comfort and grandeur that disney excels in creating  doesn t play like a celebration  in its sentimental yearning for a golden age when another one s upon us  it feels a little like a rebuke  an exhilarating animation concert  compared to how visually and narratively imaginative disney released animated films have been in the 1990s  this one seems at a loss for purpose  
48,pollock,for better and worse  pollock is an action painterly picture  an ambitious work of ambiguous surfaces  harris as an actor does justice to his long term passion to play pollock  it tracks a mythology of creativity which runs from caravaggio to patti smith  and is running still  unended  a highly personal  rigorous  and thoughtful analysis of a truly troubled genius  that rare breed  a biopic that makes you want to learn more about its subject  as much as you can  as fast as you can  that altogether rare movie about an artist that works because it takes the art itself for granted  a difficult and demanding movie  one that rewards the persevering moviegoer just as pollock s difficult and demanding paintings ultimately reward the steadfast  a ruddy little movie with a seething core and a chill in its bones  this may not be exactly the movie pollock deserves  but it s the one he got  and  reservations aside  it s pretty darn good  harris  oscar nominated performance is quite moving  making pollock a better movie than the predictability of its story arc would indicate  like its subject  pollock is a messy creation  but one whose depth of commitment and high attack keeps it on track  flat and uninvolving  flash cards from a life but with no life itself  
49,o_brother_where_art_thou,an especially elaborate variation on hee haw  
50,the_vertical_ray_of_the_sun,this might just be the perfect time to soak up some of its calm and natural beauty  tran anh hung  who earned an oscar nomination for his first movie  the scent of green papaya  1993   has created another exquisite portrait of vietnamese family life  the film s minimalism works against it  there are scenes that simply ask the audience to drink in the details  to enjoy the repast  just as much as follow the plot  a provocative meditation on the possibility of domestic happiness  made of a serene dynamite that s all but unknown to american film audiences  plays like a holy  erotic mood piece  gentle  ravishingly beautiful and awash in everyday sensuality  tackles the problem of happiness in today s world with a poetic succinctness all too rare in movies today  
51,space_cowboys,space cowboys is at least three different movies  high tech thriller  low key comedy  rumination on aging  jammed together into an implausible but very likable entertainment  weak and saggy script meets predictable plot  as craftily savvy as it is well crafted  one of those over the hill gang buddyfests that pretend to be about teamwork and valor but are really about movie star cronyism  
52,tao_of_steve,sweet  funny romantic comedy for mature audiences  one of the things i like about the movie is the wit of its dialogue  the way sentences and conversations coil with confidence up to a conclusion that is totally unexpected  
53,1100998-contender,the movie has plenty going for it  a terrific cast led by joan allen  jeff bridges and gary oldman  a captivating story line  a sharp script  most important  the contender has timing  thoughtful  enjoyable film for older teens  silly as it is  the contender has a lurid zest that keeps you hooked  and a rambunctiously good cast  what makes this twisty  cautionary yarn     delicious is a cast that chews the scenery with such obvious enjoyment  a landslide winner as an emotionally rewarding drama  what the contender lacks in sophistication and subtlety  it more than makes up for with sheer verve and chutzpah  what it lacks in credibility  it more than makes up for in energy and scandalous wit  excellent performances in an entertaining if less than totally plausible story  however neatly packaged  the contender is double dealing baloney  the film s very premise  while initially promising  doesn t hold up to lengthy scrutiny  an intelligent and informed look at the preposterous ways our leaders are often picked and sabotaged  
54,virgin_suicides,intense  imperfect movie about teen suicide  the tone of wistful regret and longing doesn t preclude a good deal of gentle humour  it s a restrained  subtly suggestive piece which disintegrates if you try to get a fix on it  coppola s direction engagingly avoids the coming of age cliches and the film boasts an excellent performance from kirsten dunst  if missteps hold the film back from achieving the full grandeur it aims for  there is no denying the way it conjures a magic realist american suburbia  rarely before brought so convincingly to life  a disarmingly wispy film given its subject matter  which is pretty much spelled out by its title  more than most recent movies about suburban adolescence  the virgin suicides catches both the triviality and the grandeur of youth  its prosaic details and its mythopoetic flights  this shimmery  darkly comic adaptation of jeffrey eugenides  novel marks the assured  often inspired feature film debut of writer director sofia coppola  coppola has created a detective story without a solution and a coming of ager without discernable characters  may haunt you for some time to come  the film slices through its dizzying succession of events with clean  swift efficiency  a weird and glorious tribute to ephemera of every possible sort  
55,quills,a literate  playfully provocative defense of free speech at its most abominable  philip kaufman and doug wright s movie impudently positions the marquis de sade as the twisted spokesman for the creative spirit  it pokes at sexual taboos   it s pretty subversive  considering   but sexuality and creativity are indelibly linked  and its true subject is expression  repression and catharsis  a gripping tale of eroticism and sexual fantasy that keeps grips with its taught atmosphere and passionate performances  more heavy handed than memorable  the material benefits from a top rank cast that fleshes out what could seem merely an exercise in philosophy  kaufman is one of the great  underappreciated maestros of the movies  and his work here is indeed masterly  a rare hollywood movie that is about the nature of eroticism without being afraid of its own power to arouse  it breathes  it twirls  it prances right up into your face  it swirls over the top sometimes  but there never is any doubt you re watching a movie about something  kaufman     finds a tone that remains more entertaining than depressing  more absorbing than alarming  geoffrey rush plays this rascal to the magnificent hilt  it argues its case fairly  acknowledging the implicit dangers in its position  and dramatizing the price that inevitably will be paid for its cherished goal of untrammeled personal expression  
56,keep_the_river_on_your_right,unfortunately bitten off more than it can chew  what s brilliant about the film is that it doesn t quite buy its hero s somewhat self serving account  meanders  dawdles  doubles back on itself but finally gets us somewhere fascinating and worthwhile  uses a single notorious incident to liven up an otherwise less than riveting story  
57,finding_forrester,if director gus van sant had always been a hack it wouldn t matter so much  but personally i find this form of licking the audience s cheeks like an obsequious puppy deeply offensive  there is nothing more appealing to watch in a movie than one character teaching another  except perhaps when two characters teach each other  
58,rugrats_in_paris,nauseating gags suggest the makers of this eclectically animated adventure    know their audience  though all the godfather references will be thoroughly puzzling to at least half of it  we get nauseating homilies on the values of friendship  family  and parenting and a soundtrack full to bursting with vacuous pop acts  just as good as the last outing  this is great kiddie fare with some filmic references for the adults  predictable and not terribly clever  seems more like a merchandising ploy than a successful attempt to entertain kids and their parents  for grown ups  the jokes are often flat tires  largely thanks to their context  thesp voicings are outstanding  and sometimes reach the level of comic warmth of the toy story ensemble  this is modestly clever animation that has characters kids can identify with and enough grown up jokes to keep parents from settling into catatonia  it doesn t matter how weak the script is  chuckie will win your heart every time he opens his mouth and speaks in that timid  nasal dripping voice  you can bet on it  some scenes are truly  inventively bizarre  rugrats again blends poignancy with fun in a way that touches parents  even as it goes for kids with a run of bodily function and booger jokes  if you re a parent  you could do a heck of a lot worse than taking the spawn off to catch rugrats in paris and if you re a kid  well  you probably already knew that anyway  looks like what it really is    a 77 minute long episode of the tv series projected onto a theater screen  adults can attend this movie with a fair degree of pleasure  
59,tigerland,this take on vietnam war doesn t break new thematic ground but it s schumacher s best film since the 1993 falling down  and it showcases the talents of newcomer colin farrell  who has everything that it takes to become a major hollywood star stylistically this is more interesting and more affected than schumacher s flawless  either way  it s a big improvement on his past tendentious nonsense  even when the script overtaxes the allegory about how vietnam divided a nation at home  schumacher and the actors prevail by fixing their sights on what happens to men on that last stop before the game of war becomes a grim reality  a beautifully crafted  brilliantly acted and gently moving film that only occasionally lapses into sentimentality  despite his usual ability to spend more time on set design than he does on actors  schumacher handles the more intimate setting with great skill  for those who don t mind being challenged  however  and are curious to see why farrell is being touted as the next big thing  tigerland has its rewards  tigerland lands squarely in the top tier of best movies about america s vietnam experience  tigerland is tightly constructed and culminates with a stunningly appropriate charge of ambiguity  an affecting  old fashioned  antiwar war story  beneath the rough vrit exterior beats the same slick  corny heart that has pumped blood  and money  through mr  schumacher s batman and john grisham pictures  
60,remember_the_titans,inspiring football drama brings history to life  
61,unbreakable,whereas the sixth sense left audiences surprised but surprisingly comfortable  this more mature and ambitious movie preserves its ambiguities and keeps everyone guessing  despite my misgivings  i m glad i saw the film  samuel l  jackson plays a comic book art collector named elijah  as in the prophet  and his stare could probably burn a hole through superman s fortress of solitude  thrill kill plots  cardboard characters and zap pow editing are not for shyamalan  who takes his good  thoughtful time to snare audiences in his dark web  dreary though spiritually sound  if you can manage that precious  tentative suspension of disbelief  you ll find unbreakable a rewarding meditation on the nature of heroes  both comic book and otherwise  unbreakable seems to have encouraged all its actors to emulate willis  lugubrious pacing  meaning that usually vibrant actors such as wright penn and jackson are not shown to their best advantage  mind bogglingly sophomoric  
62,code_unknown,european cinema at its very best  
63,1097859-sunshine,there s no denying the rare ambition of a film with intelligence and empathy to burn  you go in expecting a history lesson and emerge impressed by the shifting hues of humanity  well intentioned but never entirely engaging     it s an absorbing  weighty picture  which worries at still important ideas about duty and inheritance  and at how we may define ourselves against the tide of history  this is a movie of substance and thrilling historical sweep  and its three hours allow szabo to show the family s destiny forming and shifting under pressure  a bombastic three hour saga that moves like a 1 000 page book left idle in front of a window fan  
64,my_dog_skip,proves even the tiredest genre can be reinvigorated in the right hands  grows on you like kudzu  while kids will be delighted by the canine antics  parents will find themselves choking back tears  flaws and all  this is superior family entertainment in the tradition of quality that co producer mark johnson has long championed  they may find themselves mystified and a little bored by a movie designed to leave their adult companions misty eyed  the movie doesn t so much tug at your heart as give it a series of vigorous yanks  a must for anyone whose best friend growing up was a dog  many will find their tender emotion buttons bruised from the constant battering of the filmmakers  oversized pointers  it may make you cry  but not because you ve seen something worthy of your tears  
65,the_big_kahuna,it doesn t matter how much he pirouettes  paces  prowls and postures  there s something just a tad too effete about spacey s performance to make larry as dangerous a presence as he needs to be  spacey comes across as a live wire charged by alternating currents of cynicism and desperation  turning from sardonic wit to savage fury in the space of an anxious heartbeat  it s no meal  but it ll tide you over  a well acted if very stagy adaptation of roger rueff s play hospitality suite  the big kahuna offers lessons that might apply quite nicely to arthur miller s pathetic pavement pounder  a ponderous stage adaptation that expends only the mildest effort to overcome its staginess  if you re prepared to accept an inherent staginess that gradually fades as the film progresses  you can become caught up in a drama of extraordinary power and insight  
66,frequency,this ambitious but frustrating timeshift thriller never quite manages to jam together two distinct stories  
67,american_psycho,a well crafted yet essentially innocuous period piece  
68,charlies_angels,this is nothing but trailer moments  ex pop video director mcg couldn t organise a pillow fight in a bedding factory  charlie s angels is like a hong kong flick but without the bogus spirituality and excruciating schlock pop ballads  the cast members seem to be having a high old time  and with sharper dialogue  an even higher time might have been had by all  these kickass barbies bring heart to a machine tooled genre  a film whose slick editing and glib lines are absolutely no substitute for real drama and proper exchanges  i guess i m just supposed to sit back and enjoy it  but somehow i feel exploited  this choppily edited film looks like confetti  despite the fact that the film loses its razor sharp pacing and muddles its storyline  the movie still features plenty of big explosions  loud music and bare flesh  
69,dancer_in_the_dark,dancer is like no other movie around  shot in bleached out video colors in rough  hand held style  the film is at once aggressively modern and deliberately  melodramatically  old fashioned  the situations that writer director lars von trier serves up here might be embarrassingly florid  but the coupling of his manipulative skills and bj rk s showy intensity results in a movie with the force of an emotional bulldozer  aims right for the heart and aces its target  von trier is asking not that you take a leap of faith  he s asking you to hold his hand while he jumps off the bridge  it s not just that the numbers are berserkly bad  they also don t seem to have any emotional connection to this bedraggled  dickensian waif  so unrelenting in its manipulative sentimentality that  if it had been made by an american and shot in a more conventional manner  it would be seen as a bad joke  much of it comes across as a giant  misshapen ego trip  selma asks for so little  complains so seldom  and is in such perpetual denial about her problems that i find her virtually indigestible as a character  a bitter confection chock full of rusty barbs and a woeful  inexorable slide into doom and worse  
70,keeping_the_faith,an astute directorial debut for actor edward norton  it s as soft and squishy as anything by nora ephron or pre caustic woody allen  we could be looking at a word of mouth sleeper here  a far more enjoyable experience than one would expect given its diagrammatic  overlong script  
71,gangster-no-1,they crush each other under cars  throw each other out windows  electrocute and dismember their victims in full consciousness  and we don t avert our eyes for a moment  just watch bettany strut his stuff  you ll know a star when you see one  
72,shadow_magic,there is a humane touch here missing from so many modern movies  jared harris and xia yu give appealingly energetic performances  
73,1098038-shaft,a guilty pleasure for adults and older teens  shaft pushes our buttons which means it s something that has been next to unheard of this year  reasonably rousing screen entertainment  the story becomes a mess about halfway through  john singleton may have been the youngest director ever to be nominated for an academy award  but i wouldn t exactly call him a natural born filmmaker  what really clicks are some of the stars  unlike other summer movies  the action here mostly is as real and rugged as bullets and fists  its sheer balls out bravado is often brutally funny  singleton shows enough in shaft to indicate he can make this kind of motion picture  if nothing else  shaft is spicy fast food  the current version tries awfully hard but with little success to create a shaft for this day and age  few stars of late have displayed more sheer joy in a mainstream project than jackson does here  this new shaft has the stuff to grab its audience in a big way  maybe even opening up a new franchise  
74,u571,script characterizations so shallow that even a lead actor as dull as matthew mcconaughey can t be blamed very much  manages to work up some generic claustrophobic discomfort  the submarine goes deep but the story never does  
75,grateful_dawg,this delightfully unpretentious documentary presents some terrific performance footage of the two men  enjoyable little fan film  
76,timecode,an intriguing  often very entertaining thriller with deliciously sexy  satirical and melodramatic flourishes  some movies become milestones on the basis of quality  others  for being where they are when they are  mike figgis  time code is assured of qualifying in the second category  surprisingly breezy to watch  because figgis smashingly manipulates sound to focus our attention from one place to another  figgis has devised a genuinely novel way to shoot and experience a feature length film  apart from its technological originality  time code is almost completely uninteresting  for those who just want a good story and to heck with exploring brave new worlds of cinema  time code may seem like time cod liver oil  as gimmicky as that sounds  what s most amazing about the enterprise is how well it works  time code seems to be one of those instant cult movies  non cult members are likely to end up with confusion and possible eye strain  stands as a rare feat of technology made human  the screen is filled by 28 actors  some familiar and some not  but all of them effective  
77,about_adam,if anybody still thinks kate hudson is getting too much mileage out of being goldie hawn s daughter  they ll be pleasantly surprised by the range she shows in about adam  squanders its potential themes  
78,1095081-boiler_room,ribisi  such a promising supporting actor in saving private ryan as a medic and friends as phoebe s dopey brother  doesn t seem a big enough presence for a starring role yet  boiler room is a new film that will yank anyone who s ever gotten a cold call from a chop shop  last reel is particularly disappointing in its naive philosophy  manifest in younger s rush to bring the various conflicts to satisfying closure  despite ribisi s success in giving seth some sleepy eyed  slouching charisma  we never really know what makes him tick  the more younger shows his baby brokers haranguing would be customers over the phone  the more apparent it becomes that in the real world  even the most desperate investor would hang up on these abusive clowns  a shallow script that never gets at the heart or conflict behind the swagger  the movie hums with authenticity  and knows a lot about the cultlike power of a company that promises to turn its trainees into millionaires  and certainly turns them into efficient phone salesmen  boiler s adrenaline rush film creates an elaborate stock scam  
79,small_time_crooks,this is an amiable and quite conventional comedy  the biggest problem is that it s not all that funny  the whole movie  with its rather antiquated notions of the lower classes  feels as if it were inspired by another era  not much here to interest to children  a pleasantly surprising little treat  the ensemble cast performs in perfect cadence  more fun than anything woody allen has written and directed since bullets over broadway  ullman and grant are fun to watch  but the real standout performance is elaine may as frenchy s dim witted cousin  these people offer no sense that they exist beyond the bits of exposition that allen has written into his screenplay  it plays more like a second draft than a final product  aching for conceptual wisdom  
80,1097046-dinosaur,stunning  but can be dark and scary in places  aurally and visually this creature feature is a treat  sadly  there is little sign of the benefits of evolution in the storytelling itself  which sticks too closely to a narrative template seemingly dating back to the mesolithic era  for a story that takes place some 65 million years ago  dinosaur is awfully reliant on recent recycled parts  if storytelling is the creative equivalent of water  i should point out it s no surprise these dinosaurs find themselves trekking over endless expanses of dusty  dry terrain  one dinosaur that won t soon be forgotten  pure disney formula  the plot couldn t be more stale if it wafted from a sarcophagus  a feast for the eyes but a rather routine entry in the respectable folio of great disney animated movies  a serenely pleasing kiddie movie that invites little ones to sink into their dinosaur dreams  i enjoyed the movie as sheer visual spectacle 
81,yards,i can t remember when a film so well acted and so well rendered visually was also so oppressive to sit through  self consciously elegiac  the yards is a slow burning but meticulously crafted family melodrama posing as a thriller  collapses into a weary catalog of crime movie cliches and political impossibilities  more preoccupied with themes and moods than providing anything intriguing plot wise or character wise for the viewer to truly care about  a serious film that strives for a moral complexity and a textural density rarely found in contemporary dramas  it is so choked with its own solemnity that it barely musters the energy to tell a story  one of the best dramatic films to come out of hollywood this year  better in execution than in content  and gray will be a name to watch once his talents are allied to a better screenplay  for he is undoubtedly a gifted  distinctive visual artist  the ingredients are here for a classy crime drama  they just don t blend that easily  a slice of nyc made with imitation cheese  
82,bring_it_on,who would have thought that a film about competing cheerleading squads would turn out to be the one very pleasant surprise in this very dismal summer season of moviegoing  dunst can t really hold pic together  the tart  taut script by first time screenwriter jessica bendinger is stuffed with such deliciously mean dialogue  
83,anywhere_but_here,solid story of independence for teens  the movie drops in on a crucial part of their lives  follows it for a few minutes and then jettisons to another episode  it s like watching 10 short stories  you start wishing you were anywhere but here    preferably at last year s far funnier slums of beverly hills  there s a warmly harmonic convergence among scriptwriter alvin sargent  director wayne wang and cinematographer roger deakins  both susan sarandon and natalie portman deserve to make the short list in february for breathing fresh air into an all too familiar mother daughter act  it provides a rich  sometimes even jolting emotional ride  the real revelation here is portman  the 17 year old actress can play a range of emotions beyond actresses twice her age  this wayne wang directed movie hands sarandon one of the richest comic dramatic opportunities of her career    while also confirming portman as one of her own generation s best and brightest  adele and ann don t really seem like mother and daughter  their conflicts are more a matter of theatrical convenience than something born in the blood  
84,1098149-patriot,a rip snorting good flick that breaks the cinematic jinx against revolutionary war stories  it wisely focuses upon common folk rather than prominent figures  
85,chocolat,the moral argument may be pat and predictable  but the movie disarms you with its charm and its solid craftsmanship   however familiar  the taste is still sweet  the texture light as a souffle  the sentiments pleasantly high caloric  chocolat is like being force fed chocolate for two hours  fabulous french fairy tale and romance for teens and up  ultimately  especially coming from director lasse hallstrom  such a slight flick doubles as a fat disappointment  if you can t be bothered running a nice warm bath  see this instead  one of those whimsical concoctions that tries too hard  and goes too long  for its own good  chocolat  like hallstrom s adaptation of the cider house rules  succeeds primarily through its casting  an appealing comic fable aimed at those with a bittersweet tooth  a lovely film  encouraging to those who need encouragement and confirming to those who know and live by the liberating truth it espouses  it wants desperately to seem like a hand made delight  but you can tell that it comes from a factory  suffers from disparate elements  hallstrom  who gets more sticky sweet with each new release  needs to learn that too much candy can lead to a tummy ache  it s all a bit prefab  but the idea of equating the forces of chocolate and sensual indulgence with the forces of goodness is pretty surefire  
86,1099492-saving_grace,in trying too hard to convince us what good eggs his characters are  cole creates a shapeless  dramatically unengaging movie  blethyn s solid gold charm turns saving grace into a comic high  inanely upbeat and grindingly obvious  the movie amounts to a checklist of inevitable tee heeing scenarios that surface on cue  only to wilt instantly before your eyes  it has two great british landmarks  champion actress brenda blethyn and that wonderful rugged cornwall coast  all that s enough for a temporary high  built on a one note  one joke idea  after an uproarious first half  saving grace arrives at its conclusion somewhat hastily and conveniently  but to its credit  it still maintains a sunny comic mellow  it s a breezy and entertaining little charmer that works because it s not rendered on too precious a scale  crowd pleasing enough to provide a pleasant buzz  the familiar  derivative feel is in part offset by a hard to deny level of appeal  we re left with a promising idea for a comedy  which arrives at some laughs but never finds its destination  take away the marijuana  and what you have in saving grace is a comedy of the old school and  depending on your view of the current state of screen humor  that s either a promise or a warning  
87,princess_and_the_warrior,it s just over two hours long but feels like much more  you don t have any idea what s going to happen next  nowhere near as dynamic as the title implies  doesn t lack for ideas  nor for images that will sweep you up in their boldness and have the resonance of dreams  a highly imaginative effort which is grounded in the reality of being disturbed  
88,return_to_me,easily the most sane and encouraging romantic comedy since the far more polished  but equally expansive and ethnically flavored moonstruck  this pg rated trifle is the perfect movie to take your parents to see without fear of embarrassment  first time director bonnie hunt has taken what could have been an incredibly sappy story and used her sense of comedic timing to fashion a date flick that even the guys might enjoy  as if aware they are imprisoned in the subplot of a terrible movie  actors carroll o connor  robert loggia  eddie jones  william bronder and marianne muellerleile have a near mutiny on screen  
89,wonderland_2000,wonderland is well crafted from the editing to the acting  but it often feels like a television pilot for a calculatedly hip soap opera  the film s realistic approach to storytelling and the strong performances mesh well with winterbottom s stylistic flourishes  it becomes one of those movies that hurt so good  one of those rare films in which everything comes together  winterbottom simply spends two hours dispersing the spiteful attitude of england s  angry young man  films throughout the general populace  channels the self evident symptoms of urban malaise into a movie of authentic textures and seemingly spontaneous gestures  the film gets a lot of emotional power and tension out of everyday occurrences  there s something wonderful in wonderland  after all  
90,claim,easily the most compelling western to hit our screens since unforgiven  takes place against a frigid canvas gorgeously captured by alwin kuchler  though director michael winterbottom has impressively created a believable 19th century prospecting town  he is unable to bring the people who live in it to life  a movie like this rides on its cinematography  and alwin h  kuchler evokes the cold darkness so convincingly that kingdom come seems built on an abyss  
91,the-tigger-movie,when it comes to pooh stories  a shortage of ambition and reluctance to improve on success should be counted as assets  this tigger outing feels more like an overblown tv special than a grand theatrical release  
92,pitch_black,the script is a compendium of science fiction clichs  familiar in hollywood movies since the early fifties  made to please those who can t get enough rote  cheesy sci fi  pitch black promises to make us long for the glory days of species 2 and deepstar six  ferocious attacks by the planet s monstrous creatures manage only partially to alleviate the tedium that defines the movie  despite far too many video game moments and annoying taglines  the scifi thriller pitch black just may be the most entertainingly derivative movie of the millennium so far  pitch black is one of those annoyingly noisy outer space thrillers where you can t figure out the characters  names at first  and when you finally do  they are either dead or you hate them  neither scary nor exciting nor much of anything  save eyestrain  how sad it is that humans travel countless light years away from earth  only to find themselves inhabiting the same tired generic conventions  a routine sci fi horror action adventure  takes us where we ve been countless times before  it s not an especially challenging part  but diesel handles it with aplomb  pitch black is so jaunty  so limber  and so visually self assured that art peeks through where crap has traditionally made its home  
93,mission_impossible_2,woo lays on his own particular high octane stylishness so thick the results edge perilously toward self parody  a vaguely absurd epidemiological thriller filled with elaborately superfluous setups and shamelessly stale james bond riffs  
94,kikujiro,these gags work because kitano has created an intrinsically funny character and because he has perfect timing and a terrific sense of construction  you can t smile when you keep feeling sorry for the kid  who is not  after all  in on the joke  the comic drama is refreshingly anti sentimental but will break your heart anyway      the solemn young sekiguchi is a real find  complementing his co star and never becoming as icky as the brats who d be up for a hollywood remake  
95,1097245-hamlet,just not quite daring or spectacular enough  
96,alice_et_martin,shot and edited with crisp flair  alice and martin keeps flying off in unexpected directions  anchored by binoche s dark  obstinate passion  an involving love story between two emotionally damaged outsiders  for all the increasing sophistication of tchin s technique  the emotions he deals with are basic  and all the more powerful for it  techine keeps a tight rein on his actors  dramatics  falls just shy of greatness  with his thirteenth feature  andr tchin conducts a masterly dissection of male hysteria  when it comes to movies about dysfunctional family relationships and emotionally damaged individuals  few active filmmakers do a better job than veteran french director andr techin  low key and curiously devoid of thematic density  this is confident  but rather soulless film making  tchin  typically honest and generous  always allows the churning emotional undercurrents to take over  even a flawed techine film merits our attention  
97,1103231-gift,a superior horror movie for older teens  there s really just one reason to see the southern freak show that is sam raimi s the gift  and fortunately it s the best reason  to watch the star of the piece  a glorious textbook example of a gifted film maker s ability to transform a familiar genre and  thrillingly  to confound our expectations in the process  raimi s latest picture  the gift  looks like an attempt to create a classier version of the kind of horror movie that established his reputation nearly two decades ago  uneven and conventional  the movie has an impressive cast  blanchett is a terrific actress who deserves better than this  unfortunately  raimi and thornton    who collaborated as director and star on the genuinely creepy a simple plan    have only enough material this time to sustain half a movie  at its best the gift evokes some of the creepy chills of to kill a mockingbird  and at its heart  there s blanchett  an actress whose instincts are unerring  and dead on  a modest entertainment  logic is mocked  plot strands capriciously abandoned  actors chew upholstery  and the heroine has so many  don t open that door  lady   moments that the movie starts to play like an unintended parody of overblown hokum  raimi s skillful direction  the way he positions the camera  and his brilliant pacing keep things jumping almost until the final frame  a solidly crafted  suspensefully written  powerfully acted little juggernaut  the smartest and scariest supernatural thriller since the sixth sense  even if you ve figured out where the gift is headed  the actors keep you watching closely  
98,dr_t_and_the_women,richly enjoyable robert altman  not for kids  it s all hub and no bub  on the surface  altman s film is clearly meant as a paean to the variety and emotional fecundity of women  but scratch the surface  and you realize that underneath  it s not so pretty  dr  t is vintage altman  the best movie he s made since short cuts  a flabby farce in which everyone seems to be making it up as they go along  there s the kernel of an intriguing idea that we can almost grasp  but it s lost in the morass of expertly staged but irrelevant scenes  gere appears to be having such a luscious time surrounded by the film s fuzzy sketch of genteel  grotesque  distaff texas that he s forgotten to be smug  hampered by a flighty tone that wears mighty thin by the time the two hour picture     takes its final over the top turn  after the film wanders for two hours  growing more and more absurd  it ends in an extremely unsatisfying way  has hardly any plot at all  or believable characters  might have been titled dr  t and the miserable hos  ultimately  dr  t is the cinematic equivalent of shooting well dressed turkeys in a barrel  while it s impossible to call anything fashioned by a man of altman s skill unwatchable  there are times when this pedantic and dull effort comes close  
99,1097259-road_trip,vulgar for some parents  but teens will love  the movie takes a slice out of the american pie recipe book by at least making the final screen product funnier than the trailer  road trip is broadly amusing with a few bright spots  but those can t cover up the major gaps in storytelling  characterization and laughs  road trip is nothing more than a series of sight gags and put downs  it s often funny  but it never has anything smart to say  on the whole it works because its over the top humor is supported by the filmmakers  ability to view life with a clear eyed lack of sentimentality  still  although the subject matter is sophomoric it has enough of a plot and key performances to humor more sophisticated moviegoers too  as the guys continue on their way to texas  this road trip degenerates into a slow moving game of connect the gross outs  scott and green seem to be having the most fun  but the entire cast is energetic and the movie feeds on that enthusiasm  multiplexes should be thronged with howling  high fiving young men deep into summer  
100,monsters_inc,the uses of enchantment haven t changed  kids still need  maybe more than ever  the special comfort of fabulous threats they can control  another chance to see pixar s most dazzling premise  now spruced up with a third dimension  it may be harder nowadays to dazzle audiences with fancy visual effects  but monsters  inc  3d proves that smart  imaginative storytelling still does the trick every time  not even the opportunistic 3d ification can squander the pure delight of the film s meticulously detailed world of ragtag creatures  the movie itself stands up well  even from an adult  two dimensional perspective  cute  kid friendly monster movie  may scare sensitive kids  the good guys are those who realize that laughter is stronger than fear  that s a message worth taking to heart these jittery days  the excellent basic ideas have yielded too few twists and dramatic junctures to keep the picture flying at the level at which it starts  the analogy to our dependence on  say  oil is soon abandoned  the better to blur the distinction between abstract and concrete  something older viewers of this 2001 animated adventure may appreciate more than younger ones  brighter and more exuberant than shrek  this would be a worthy winner of the first animation oscar  the balance tilts towards action and gags  and does them gloriously  triumphantly reconfirms the geniuses at pixar as the 800 pound gorillas of modern animation and the reigning kings of family entertainment  staggeringly generous with its witty lines  its allusions  above all with its sheer visual spectacle

102,time-out-l-emploi-du-temps,time out is stylish and hushed  at once suspenseful and melancholy  it can t be neatly fitted into a genre  just as its hero  played with devastating understatement by recoing  can t be easily dismissed as a psycho or a villain  the drama discloses almost nothing  what a modern horror story  moody  reflective and acutely noticing  time out is less a drama than a cinematic essay about one man s experience in an era defined for professional and laborer by downsizing  from those first moments behind the windshield  time out draws you into its world of quiet deception  skip work to see it at the first opportunity  a sad  visually stunning commentary on life in the new economy  time out does two things very well  cantet beautifully illuminates what it means sometimes to be inside looking out  and at other times outside looking in  i admire the closing scenes of the film  which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent s complaint  a taut psychological thriller that doesn t waste a moment of its two hour running time  writer director cantet  the filmmaker responsible for the similarly provocative human resources  has an extremely arid sensibility  
103,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_fellowship_of_the_ring,jackson is working from obvious passion  he knows the most special of effects are expected of him but deploys his technology smartly  most ambitiously  this rousing adventure closes with an ending that s closer in spirit to an art house film than a popcorn holiday romp  the new zealander director peter jackson  who wrote the screenplay with fran walsh and philippa boyens  works with enough dramatic tension and pictorial grandeur to sustain us through long periods of complicated exposition and heavy bouts of swordplay  if fellowship hasn t rescued an otherwise dreadful year  it at least gives us something to look forward to    same time  next year  it s full of scenic splendors with a fine sense of scale  but its narrative thrust seems relatively pro forma  and i was bored by the battle scenes  putting formula blockbusters to shame  fellowship is impeccably cast and constructed with both care and passion  in unveiling the holy grail for action fantasy aficionados  director and co writer peter jackson has begun a series to rival star wars in the pantheon  a nerve jangling  pictorially beautiful  mostly engrossing phantasmagoria of ghouls and warriors  oozing ambitions and towering dark castles  waylaid only by an occasional dip into the bog of exposition   here are beauties that pierce like swords or burn like cold iron  here is a  film  that will break your heart   tolkien completists won t find any of this overkill  but for those uninitiates among us  less is more is still a dictum worth heeding  if you ve managed to elude tolkien s siren call over the years  this is your chance to catch up and fall for it once and for all  the real deal  a movie epic that pops your eyes out  piles on thrills and fun  and yet stays intimately attuned to character  you can get gloriously lost in this  
104,dish,the dish also does a nice job of evoking what 1969 was like for people who didn t live in san francisco  paris or even melbourne  australia  makes you admire the australian ability to make a comedy that s sincere rather than crass  for many moviegoers  that feel good spirit is going to be hard to resist  shows us that when done with restraint  nostalgia can be fine  images of the revolving and tilting dish are sufficient in themselves and do more than make up for the musical goosing on the soundtrack  
105,with_a_friend_like_harry,movies like this are more intriguing than thrillers where the heroes and villains wear name tags  a more energetic and interesting entry than what one has come to expect from this overpopulated genre  rises instantly above its genre merely by taking the time to develop its characters and scenario  
106,werckmeister_harmonies,as wearying as the film becomes in its long  bleak sequences  its uniquely cinematic and emotion charged experience makes the effort worthwhile  six years after the 7 1 2 hour satan s tango  magyar maverick bela tarr makes a stunning feature return with  werckmeister harmonies   another hypnotic meditation on popular demagogy and mental manipulation that s a snap at 145 minutes  bela tarr s style seems to be an attempt to regard his characters with great intensity and respect  to observe them without jostling them  to follow unobtrusively as they move through their worlds  which look so ordinary and are so awesome  like ours  over two hours and 20 minutes  not much actually happens  and tarr creates a mood so lulling that even the rare scenes of dialogue can be hard to follow  but werckmeister s standout moments are searing like few others in film history  for once  understanding is less important than experiencing  this will be a tough watch for many  an uncompromisingly difficult and severe experience  but i found it unique  mesmeric and sublime  werckmeister harmonies exerts a peculiarly powerful spell  using long takes  sensuous camera movements and the mournful beauty of mihaly vig s score  tarr offers in werckmeister harmonies an indelible statement on loneliness and spiritual thirst  tarr s precise yet effortless command for the long take is so transcendent it suggests the presence of god  a totally sustained immersion in the magisterially bleak  voluptuously monochromatic  undeniably beautiful universe of muddy villages and cell like rooms  
107,ghost_world,the greatest distinction of  ghost world  is its singular spirit  here s a dark  deadpan comedy about alienated kids that manages to be smart  surpassingly odd  extremely funny and mysteriously endearing at the same time  see it for birch s hostile stare and johansson s devastating monotone  most of ghost world is funny  but the laughs are inextricably tied to the painful alienation and self loathing that comes with living on society s fringes  it isn t a perfect film  but it s never less than strikingly original  it s a sneaky  snide and cynical masterpiece of urban dystopia seen through the eyes of youth and ranks as one of the best american films so far this year  zwigoff pulls off something in ghost world that seems a minor miracle    he creates someone with a complex inner life  adeptly evokes the unbearable dullness of being 18  the precarious power play of female friendship  the torpor born from having to decide what  other plans  you should make if you re not going to go to college  for all its weirdness and weightless suburban ennui  this is actually a very plausible  understated account of late adolescent pain  never predictable  this movie is often hilarious as well as touching  subtly adapting the mise en scene of clowes s original without being fancy or obtrusive about it  a touching study of alienation that comes with no easy answers or excuses for those who cannot seem to connect in life  give this weirdly humanitarian picture a try  and don t be surprised if you find yourself smiling through the bummer  graced by numerous wonderful and amusing touches  and boasts sterling performances by birch and buscemi

114,no_mans_land,it s hard to believe this is writer director danis tanovic s first feature fiction film  the film would have been a stunner under any circumstances  but with the situation in afghanistan and the middle east worsening on a daily basis  no man s land feels even more relevant  tanovic  himself a war veteran  expertly twists us within the dilemma while avoiding easy answers  a skillfully wrought  if somewhat predictable  farce involving belligerent opponents  blundering international peacekeepers and excitable journalists  a bleakly funny parable that could be titled between enemy lines  from beginning to end  it bristles with ironies in classic eastern european absurdist style  an explosively suspenseful  deeply moving dark comedy and an astonishingly assured fiction debut from tanovic  part of what makes no man s land so effective is a take no prisoners sense of humor that is characteristically balkan  equally deft at portraying the hateful madness of war and the infantile  venal feeble mindedness of military bureaucracy  
115,last_resort_2001,one of the few films to get at the ways in which single mothers and their sons alternate being authority figures  fasten your seat belt  and don t blink for a second  last resort shares with movies like lynne ramsay s ratcatcher and emmanuel finkiel s voyages a simultaneous commitment to truth telling and formal exploration  small but surprisingly satisfying  this is the best class of poetic realism  the kind you can believe in without a trace of hesitation  has a broodingly beautiful aesthetic sensibility  you walk out of the theater curiously touched  all three leads underplay effectively  and the verite style reinforces the arbitrariness with which events impinge upon their lives and force some choices  pawlikowski and his actors surprise us with fully drawn characters who defy the hopelessness and doom of their surroundings  when will american filmmakers  mainstream and independent alike  tire of being shown up by international movies that capture authenticity as a matter of course

118,amores_perros,solidly engaging  supersized 2000 mexican drama  filmmaker alejandro gonzalez inarritu conveys an urgency and a compassion that ultimately make this grim picture strangely uplifting  it s a truly prodigious piece of work  resembling a career summation far more than a maiden voyage  an ambitious multi plotted portrait of overlapping lives in contemporary mexico city  amores perros rarely relaxes its grip  the structure lacks purpose  the film struggles to justify its two and a half hour running time and the faint hearted might find it a little gory  there aren t many films coming out of hollywood that work on this many levels  give me los olvidados instead  but this pumped telenovela is very much the film kieslowski would have made had he followed buuel s lead and gone to mexico  definitely fierce and most definitely human  just keeps coming at you  switching characters  tones  and rhythms to keep you off guard  gonzlez irritu spares no detail in his telling  creating an ambitious  starkly realistic movie that just happens to be way too long  
119,hedwig_and_the_angry_inch,those expecting a rockin  good time are likely to be left cold by this screen translation  which despite some imaginative packaging too often proves a drag in more than the sartorial sense  definitely recommended for those looking for something different  despite the creator actor director s energetic efforts  the material never feels comfortable in its new form  the show belongs wholly to mitchell  although good moments are also claimed by andrea martin  miriam shor  and michael pitt in what are otherwise sketchy roles  what in any other hands than mitchell s might have been a sexual sight gag becomes a symbol of personal freedom and expression  operates successfully on enough levels one needs an elevator to fully appreciate it  the off broadway rock musical that pushes off from a botched sex change operation is sweet dynamite on film  almost guaranteed to amass a cult following as it makes its way across u s  theaters during its national release  its off kilter originality makes a welcome change from the summer s cgi dinosaur or tomb raiding behemoths  
120,the_circle_2001,an impressive piece of work  especially considering it was made in a barren artistic climate overseen by a censorious government  a tragic film from start to finish  but equally undeniable is the endless stoicism displayed by the women  and panahi s crisp  meandering direction  just like tomb raider  it is fiction  it just unfortunately comes a lot closer than the american film to the truth of how its female characters live  profoundly dangerous to the status quo in iran because it asks us to identify with the plight of women who have done nothing wrong except to be female  while the circle certainly paints a bleak portrait  there s a grace and beauty to the filmmaking that transform this crushingly sad tale into a work of revelatory art  feels less like a movie than a civics lesson  a wondrous meditation on the unspoken communication that sometimes passes between members of the same sex  a raw  riveting film that pulls you up short  by making these characters symbols rather than fleshed out individuals     panahi limits the political as well as dramatic effectiveness of the circle  circles the heart of noisy  modern tehran with an informal  documentary like freedom that is thrilling in its naturalism

131,together_2001,moodysson excels at this delicate staging of inappropriateness  his true theme begins to cohere out of the sullen stares of children forced to tap undeveloped reserves of patience as the adults test the limits of liberation  this funny  bighearted movie avoids all the pitfalls that movies about the counterculture so easily fall into  neither demonizing its free loving  leftist characters nor holding them up as untarnished free spirits  quite bright in its fashion and often singularly comic  a big hearted  generous movie that never patronizes the audience  together s portrait of its social moment is right on  tinged with delicate nostalgia  absolutely free of formula and canned sentiment  but filled with a generosity of spirit that leaves audiences feeling blessed and hopeful  moodysson has shown himself to be a master of character development and simple  but not simplistic  storytelling  a gentle  sprightly satire that pokes fun at these trendy communards but emphasizes their humanity and fallibility   moodysson  sets up characters and situations more to get across a point of view than to move along a story  
132,our_song,our song is completely convincing and much more visually accomplished  thanks in part to jim denault s attentive v rit  camerawork  it says something positive about human resilience under duress  anyone who understands the subtle shadings of friendship will appreciate our song s realistic slice of teen life  beautifully illuminates that poised on the edge period of adolescence and the sad weight of leaving childhood behind  confirms  mckay s  gift for catching ordinary folk in authentic terms on film  our song has no illusions about easy fixes  but neither does it traffic in facile despair as its three graces saunter along the cracked pavement and into our hearts  has the courage to work without a net  aware that when you re a teenager  your life is not a story so much as a million possible stories  takes familiar material and develops it with such tact and skill that we find ourselves moved and sort of amazed at the same time  mckay captures their environment without condescension  refreshingly devoid of emotional hyperbole  but the director s lean  self effacing style is occasionally less than gripping  
133,kandahar_le_soleil_derriere_la_lune,these lunar landscapes and grotesque visions are as strange and haunting as a science fiction fantasy  would that it were  intense  anecdotal and empowered by perversely beautiful imagery  kandahar does not provide deeply drawn characters  memorable dialogue or an exciting climax  its traffic is in images   t he film has so many riveting scenes  its story is more interesting for its own back story than for the difficult  problematic way makhmalbaf has of trying to dramatize it  its many moments of poetic grace make this haunting and harrowing journey a rewarding one

136,divided_we_fall,divided we fall is quintessentially czech  and it knows no borders  whether they act with cowardice or courage  the characters are invariably complex  even in the most appalling circumstances  it suggests  human folly can be funny and even moving  hrebejk furthers his country s reputation for cinematic absurdity as the only sane artistic reaction to political insanity  shows that it s not only possible to make a spine tingling world war ii saga without bloodshed  but also to use such stories to examine the agonizing but necessary values of conscience  loyalty and forgiveness  a very worthwhile entry in the proud tradition of czech filmmakers examining serious social issues with dark humor  
137,ginger_snaps,the sharp feminist narrative makes up for the admirable but underwhelming werewolf makeup and other practical effects  a smart  resourceful  and wickedly funny teen horror film that reinvents the werewolf myth as a potent metaphor for pubescent angst and humiliation  a quietly subversive my sister is turning into a werewolf movie that doesn t wimp out at the end  a superbly realized take on the perils of being different in a world that demands conformity  it deserves a cult following among satire loving  feminist minded gore aficionados who appreciate a well made human tail  john fawcett s ginger snaps cleverly links lycanthropy to vaginal flow  it s all downhill from there  but there is something efficiently creepy about the enclosed world of two alienated young women in suburbia  karen walton s sharp screenplay is especially strong in the family scenes  allowing performances of heavenly creatures intensity from the young leads

140,life_and_debt,powerfully illustrates what globalization has been doing to underdeveloped countries around the world  this case study of globalization s effects on jamaica is a timely  never dull piece of agitprop that comes off as a cross between godard s social protest docs and the harder they come  talking heads are intercut to synthesise theory and practice  but as an economic diatribe this is a bit patronising and not wholly persuasive  here is a documentary that should be mandatory viewing for anyone interested in globalisation that  war or no war  remains one of the most contentious issues of our times  it s mostly persuasive in the position it argues  after viewing documentarian stephanie black s dour exegesis of the wrecked jamaican economy     only the most insensitive vacationer will want to set foot anywhere near the resorts and beaches of montego bay  life and debt often feels like a cheap shot  but it can still pack a wallop  offers the clearest analysis of globalization and its negative effects that i ve ever seen on a movie or television screen  a travelogue with teeth  if you re curious about why the demonstrators are so angry  this is why they re so angry

146,day_i_became_a_woman,a masterwork of symbolic cinema  it depicts  with vast imagination  the ordeals faced by women in modern iranian society  what appears on the screen has a starkness that is almost indelible  creates a flow of symbolism so potent  so transporting in its physicality  that its impact all but transcends its righteous liberal  meaning   this film catapults meshkini into the  someone to watch  category  short on drama but long on poetry  an episodic drama rich in sly humor and symbolic imagery  slight but affecting  you leave not only engaged with the three main characters  but also wondering about their fate  hoping for the best  it has only fitful power as a work of art and or entertainment  still more evidence of how healthy and alive the iranian cinema is  even in a society we think of as closed  its central image instantly leaps into the pantheon of world cinema with a rightness and an urgency that glue your eyes to the screen  
147,mulholland_dr,like twin peaks  it keeps spooling out more narrative twists until the ingenious maze turns into an oppressive tangle  
148,oceans_eleven,pure hollywood moonshine  
149,la_cienaga,experiencing this film ultimately becomes as stimulating as watching metal rust  by its end we are glad to see the last of most of its characters  but we will not quickly forget them  a subtle yet acute observation of upper middle class decay

151,va_savoir,although the acting and recombinant twists of the plot dance with spontaneity  rivette s mise en sc ne is precision exemplified  a generally wonderful experience  though it should come with a warning posted outside the theatre  not for the impatient  slow but savvy look at what we do for love  don t miss it  rivette manages the complex choreography of his characters with virtuoso comic timing  its warm humor and love for its characters ultimately wins us over to its side  clocking in at 2 1 2 hours  va savoir is in essence a madcap bedroom farce  the kind where doors open and slam with wild precision  it yields surprisingly unspectacular results  it gets frenetic  in the french way  but it never stops getting amusing  this is what happens when you let grown ups make movies  as va savoir moves along and develops new layers as the characters collide and intertwine  its pleasures increase with its complexity  in a time when most 90 minute comedies unfold at the pace of a galapagos tortoise  this 21 2 hour divertissement is souffle light and airily playful  
152,nowhere-in-africa,it s exactly the sort of import you d expect to walk off with an academy award  link creates a complex and fascinating portrait of a marriage under the enormous stress of geographical dislocation and historical trauma  a well acted  exquisitely photographed  plot jammed movie that sinks into melodrama and reveals too little about the african culture and landscape in which it s set  an instant family classic to be shared and enjoyed by parents and mature teens  nowhere in africa isn t really a dull film so much as an oddly quaint one that seems to find a comfortable perspective about drastic circumstances  
153,calle_54,it is easy to imagine calle 54 having a long shelf life on home video after its run in theaters  it can be played over and over again with increasing satisfaction  a brilliantly conceived and elegantly realized documentary tribute to latin jazz  it packs more drama into each of its 12 musical tableaux than most feature films manage in two hours  a must see for avid fans and a welcome primer for nascent hip shakers everywhere  
154,faithless_2001,it s a movie that shows us that the silence between two people can be more dramatic than 100 pages of dialogue  bergman has been far better at working out these themes than anything in faithless would suggest  without giving too much away  i can tell you that my response to these events was a thundering  duh   if ullmann has unquestionably appropriated from her years with bergman  and josephson  a magnificent empathy with her players  she is also rewardingly attentive to visual detail  these three adults are all sick puppies  but neither the actors nor their director has created any reason for one to care  faithless is talky but very tight  and that cohesion relies on the bond between actors who aren t afraid to expose the depths of their characters  bergman  rare among artists these days  still believes in human complexity and value  he believes that what people do matters  its piercing honesty is remarkable  rarely has a supreme artist s twilight been so richly illuminating  an unqualified triumph  
155,harry_potter_and_the_sorcerers_stone,you can t expect perfection from muggles  professional entertainment with just enough human moments to squeak by  remarkably faithful  consistently entertaining if overlong adapatation  
156,closet,one reason that veber s comic ideas are so effective is that  in addition to being very funny  they hit on the sort of sociological issues that people really do think about  perfectly built french tickler  wins you over with its devastating simplicity  anyone expecting a serious reflection on gay or social themes or the current state of sexual attitudes in france will not find it  this sweet natured movie is mainly for laughs  auteuil continues to amaze  remaking himself with every new film  the screenplay relies too much on the first level of its premise and doesn t push into unexpected places  we are left with a mildly amusing comedy and the lingering memory of a sterling cast that deserved better material  
157,thirteen_conversations_about_one_thing,initially writer director jill sprecher seems to revel in fashionable cynicism  but her ability to look at the lighter side and her discreet faith in human nature eventually win out  without getting grand or preachy  the sprechers use an unconventional approach to coax us into asking ourselves fundamental questions  one of those exceedingly rare films in which the talk alone is enough to keep us involved  a piquant meditation on the things that prevent people from reaching happiness  
158,1106648-lie,even in its least interesting moments  l i e should be credited for attempting to put an edgy kind of truth on camera  a striking  unnerving coming of age film   l i e   is the rare american movie that isn t afraid of ambiguity or confronting an audience s preconceptions  cuesta never gives us the satisfaction of fulfilling our expectations  instead he gives us a movie that we can ponder long the road takes its final turn  a mature  insightful and extremely well acted study  difficult and flawed feature debut  one of the most provocative independent films of the year  this is a very unsettling film that left me shaking long after i left the theater  a boldly imaginative yet subtle exploration of male sexuality  it is the work of a young director with something to say  
159,1111741-rain,freights a young girl s self destructive eagerness to lose her virginity with so much danger and even horror that it s as if the events were trying to make up for the film s previous lack of drama  it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing  
160,man_who_wasnt_there,joel and ethan coen stay true to their bent for dense heroes and neonoir  and to their unshakable conviction that life usually turns out to be splendidly horrific  you may be surprised at how long the man who wasn t there sticks around  lingering in the mind long after everyone has met his or her inevitable fate  
161,what_time_is_it_there,throughout  tsai makes his rhymes work with an almost subliminal grace  from him to her  from clocks to hearts  from an ancient paris graveyard to the modern passageways of locker like columbaria    tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often  if you ve the patience  there are great rewards here  alternates between deadpan comedy and heartbreaking loneliness and isn t afraid to provoke introspection in both its characters and its audience  a rare film that actually expands and deepens in the memory when its time on screen has run out  it s the kind of leap a director makes when he has become so sure of the techniques and themes that have preoccupied him that he seems unable to make a wrong move  
162,waking_life,linklater mixed his grad student on speed discourses with a few genuinely engrossing yakkers

165,bridget_jones_diary,that zellweger can make us believe in bridget s heaving inner world is par for the course    she s a supremely talented comic actress  that she was willing to risk her own status as sex symbol by looking like an everywoman is really impressive  oh  such fun for older teens  a cheerfully frothy romantic comedy that benefits from sharp writing  lively performances and touching characterisation  this ultra hyped adaptation of the ultra successful helen fielding novel sends you out with a smile on your face  it s zellweger s unselfishness that sells the movie  how many other young actresses would be willing to let a movie make fun of their fat thighs  this is a strong debut from former documentary maker sharon maguire  who directs with chutzpah and style  funny  engaging and winning in its self deprecating modesty  albeit in a big budget sort of way  it s hugh grant  cleverly cast against type as a scheming love rat  who steals the laurels  how can you celebrate a movie in which zellweger doesn t soar but simply avoids disaster  
166,little_otik,an acquired taste that fans will likely enjoy  
167,business_of_strangers,leaves you with plenty to think about regarding the demands society places on working women  and the scorn they face when they choose career over family  boasts barbed wire performances from both actresses  all that prevents julie from turning into a stock ticker symbol and paula from being the poster girl for provocateurs are channing and stiles  who appear to draw on their own experiences  mostly smart  spring taut  low budget indie drama  
168,innocence2000,makes you long for an american filmmaker with the guts to put the aarp generation in roles this deep and rewarding  innocence is remarkable in several big ways that make it possible to overlook the nagging little ways in which it doesn t succeed  because the script has them lovey dovey from beginning to bittersweet end  their story is fatally lacking in dramatic conflict  dares to explore sexuality among mature characters  conflicting emotions give the film a genuine and warming sense of humanity  cox keeps burdening  blake and tingwell  with lines that come to sound less like credible dialogue than windy rhetoric  this movie is so wise about love it makes us wonder what other love stories think they are about  if there s a more passionate love story out there  then i haven t had the privilege of seeing it  
169,moulin_rouge_2001,i ll take a daring failure like moulin rouge  over a prefabricated success like the mummy returns any day   luhrmann  gives you way too much of what you didn t really want in the first place  soulless high jinks  so enamored with the very idea of love that only the rockiest heart could fail to crack under what amounts to one long  sustained massive musical air strike  
170,diamond_men,wahlberg looks like a rising star  while the seasoned forster manifests his usual sober authority and approachable masculinity  the kind of keenly observed  artfully crafted  warmly humane movie that keeps us going through the weekly helping of big screen duds  cohen doesn t fall into the mamet trap of equating crafty salesmanship with macho flim flam  as with so many other recent indie films he has appeared in  it is forster who truly shines  i was surprised at how much it moved me  cohen pours on schmaltz straight out of the similarly themed diamonds  
171,lumumba,peck  who assayed lumumba s life in a 1991 documentary  now paces the doomed man s story like the genuine thriller it is  ebouaney is easily the best thing about this import  an engrossing film that attempts to unearth a dark period of african history and the short lived tenure of lumumba s power  captures the volatility and chaos of a nation struggling to find its identity and purpose  gives a neglected giant of african independence his due  for better and worse  peck is no oliver stone nor even a spike lee  another director who can make a mountain of a film out of a molehill of suspicions  both compelling and occasionally bewildering  the visceral force of lumumba is a sober reminder that there s nothing more incendiary than the reopening of a forgotten chapter of history  his story is told with admirable crispness and a surprising lack of bias  a biographical drama as fiery as the man whose brief existence it illuminates  the trouble with the film is not canonization but  again  the recurrent defect in pictures about such people  the ideational data are so sketchy that it is as if we were riffling the pages of a complicated book  
172,1111227-iris,the impoverished story keeps iris from achieving greatness  but no qualifiers are needed for the acting  for a movie whose subject is the decline and fall of a towering intellect  there s precious little to think about here  not just a fitting document of a life brilliantly lived but a vibrant  almost palpitating piece of cinema  a magnificent story about the enduring bond between two eccentric  astounding souls who somehow managed to find each other and hold on for dear life  those who have had a loved one fall prey to the mental ravages of alzheimer s will see in iris a depiction that is so lucid and accurate that it may be painful to observe  because the film is well acted and written with intelligence  it might be worth seeing  despite my objections  iris glows with rightness and convinces us we re sharing its characters  understanding that when the books and the memory go  love can remain  iris sounds as if it would be painful to watch  and in scenes like the one described above  it can be  yet watching love realistically depicted onscreen remains the greatest joy of film  and its most important gift to the world  
173,jump_tomorrow,doesn t so much charm as insinuate  like its female protagonist  it s under your skin before you know it  i laughed harder than i ve laughed in a movie in months  
174,1104203-pledge,mystery thriller buffs  promise yourselves that you ll see the pledge  and while you re at it  be sure to invite along jack nicholson fans and anyone who saw the first two movies that sean penn directed  an elegant rejoinder to a tired genre  a consummate work of screen adaptation  and further evidence that there is precious little sean penn can t achieve on film  whether before or behind the lens  a movie of impressive performances and intriguing visuals that are worth the effort needed to let the tale roll out  those looking for a  feel good  movie are advised to go elsewhere    unless watching artists working near their peak leaves you soaring  i ll wager you won t see a better performance by a veteran american actor over the next 11 months  dark and disturbing but thoroughly involving  it sets off depth charges of the psyche  
175,black_hawk_down,i also don t know how well this 2001 drama represents the events of october 3 and 4  1993  though i can see that it represents them in a realist vein  referring to other war movies without becoming frivolous  a relentless immersion in combat strikingly realized but none too pleasurable to sit through   scott  does a reasonable job sketching the complicated and contradictory political context  but attempts to bring in the odd somali perspective are grossly inadequate  has the pointless verisimilitude of an expensively rendered computer simulation  a first rate war movie that presents its subject so horrifyingly well that it doesn t need to probe or preach  a biased historical reconstruction of extreme physical peril   d efinitely worth seeing for those amazing battle sequences  in gladiator and hannibal  ridley scott gave us shrewd  witty entertainments  this is macho obtuse posturing  puffed up with ersatz valour  it represents a particularly limiting application of hard bitten manly values to experiences that can t help but transcend them  i can think of no other instance when a country at war has presented on its movie theater screens such an excruciating account of battle  or such a sobering one  
176,beautiful_mind,who d have thought algebra could be so exciting  
177,ai_artificial_intelligence,what makes this world so compelling is that spielberg shows us  as few others could have  how ordinary people like ourselves feel living in it  technically dazzling yet emotionally accessible to the inner child in everyone from 9 to 90  
178,tailor_of_panama,this plot centered motion picture demands that its audience thinks rather than sits passively and watches  
179,tape,if tape s claustrophobia doesn t get to you  and if you ve got the intestinal fortitude to spend nearly 90 minutes in intimate proximity with two equally unlikeable guys  the movie does exert a certain propulsive fascination  perhaps because they are working out emotional conflicts from high school  and vince seems stuck at a childish emotional level  what takes place in the room seems juvenile  despite the powerful subject matter  
180,cats_meow,the potential of this pure hollywood babylon story remains unrealised  instead playing out as half baked agatha christie  
181,our_lady_of_the_assassins,we never come to care about these characters  perhaps because they seem to care so little about themselves  infused with an unnerving  bitterly nihilistic humor that comes off poignant rather than cheap  barbet schroeder has made many provocative films in many places but none as profound in impact as our lady of the assassins  its authenticity derives not only from the streets on which it was filmed but also from its able colombian cast  
182,training_day,abruptly shifts gears  switching from character driven issue oriented thriller to formula action driven cop flick  
183,snatch,with this morbidly bouncy black comedy ritchie finds a sneaky way to avoid sophomore slump  by passing his freshman tests all over again  and now for something completely different  please  ritchie may be skilled at generating controlled chaos  but his surprise a minute strategy ultimately holds no surprises  what we have here is a gaudy mess  at times it feels like it s being made up as it goes along  this may be one of the hazardous offshoots of the music video trained generation of moviemakers  they confuse a diet of eye candy with a full meal  bouncing around in a world of bare knuckle boxing  gypsy swindlers  pretend jewish diamond merchants  indestructible russian assassins and a thug who disposes of bodies by feeding them to hungry pigs  snatch has enough plots for a fair sized cemetery  he s not breaking new ground with snatch  merely fine tuning the knack for disreputable kicks he showed in lock  stock and two smoking barrels  the cinematic dazzle  the high pitch to which he leads his actors  the relish of sheer velocity are reward enough  the story motors like a car driven by a chatty maniac who somehow stays on the road  i ve said it before and i ll say it again  now that s entertainment  fun moments are ultimately slight compensation for snatch s overall staleness  you ll laugh and have a good old rowdy time watching snatch  but as soon as you walk out of the theater  you ll ask yourself what it was you were laughing at  hip and stylish  it s also empty  but that s probably part of the style  which draws inspiration from quentin tarantino movies and vintage british gangster films as well as music videos  snatch just seems aggressively smug  like a doorman at a club that too desperately wants to be coolly exclusive

185,1108799-score,oz courts first rate performances from each of his stars  
186,brotherhood_of_the_wolf,werewolf thriller set during french revolution  utterly preposterous but so full of enthusiasm and flashy style that it s entertaining anyway  pop fantasy action films don t have to be this unendingly horrid  ridiculously entertaining  like a 2 hour visit to some weird foreign county fair where you visit an educational exhibit  knock down some stuffed targets  catch the freak show  visit the house of horrors and then get lucky on the ferris wheel  
187,buffalo_soldiers,you won t see too much red  white and blue on this dvd transfer of buffalo soldiers  but what little there is sure looks great  see buffalo soldiers for its anarchic black comedy touches  the quirky chemistry between phoenix and paquin  but try holding your nose when the plot goes into action movie overdrive  it s an enjoyable and occasionally thought provoking motion picture whose viewership should not be diminished by the unfortunate and inaccurate  anti american  label  suffers from melodramatic overkill  
188,songcatcher,mcteer reaches for grand effects even when her characters are small time  
189,me_you_them,the big screen hasn t shown us a more earthy  commanding woman since italy s iconic anna magnani made her stand  its plot loses momentum about halfway through and gets stuck in its own precious rut  no great shakes at domestic comedy  
190,jimmy_neutron_boy_genius,a lickety split  madly packed  roller coaster entertainment that might almost have been designed to make you scared of how much smarter your kids are than you  more clever than we have any right to expect  maybe i m hopelessly mired in my own private retroville  after jimmy neutron was over  i felt glassy eyed and a little headachy  
191,before_night_falls,it s a struggle not just to make art but to exist  which is itself an art  and to that goal  the cast members  led by the astonishing bardem  allow themselves to be devoured by the roles they are playing  though schnabel s first picture  basquiat  was notable for its excess and self indulgence  the filmmaker shows restraint and maturity in this moving depiction of arenas s life and loves  consistently intriguing and surprisingly entertaining  the best american movie since american beauty  a visually arresting  well acted biopic that would be better in spanish  the main reason to see before night falls is bardem  one of the few modern actors with real animal appeal and the guts to show it  bardem hasn t the charisma to bring variety to arenas or his plight  a prosaically inspirational and passionate work  a celebration of the artistic impulse as a surging force of nature  always watchable and often engrossing  arenas is not presented as a cliche  as the heroic gay artist crushed by totalitarian straightness  but as a man who might have been approximately as unhappy no matter where he was born  it s the emotional and spiritual arc of an exile  in all its terrible isolation  that gives before night falls its power  
192,tortilla_soup,makes you famished for spice rubbed whole fish and lamb with orange salsa while it amply feeds your soul  
193,piano_teacher,seems less like a fictional story than a tour through freud s forgotten files  
194,fat_girl,bold but unrelenting in its depiction of both physical and emotional aggression  fat girl will be bracing for those open to its challenges and brutal for those who aren t  right up to its jarring final sequence  fat girl takes that cafe scene as the basis for a tragicomedy that plays out in delicately telling terms  breillat has fashioned another characteristically raw and honest portrait of sexual relations  get over the numb shock that accompanies the end credits  give yourself some distance from it and you may actually appreciate the complex machinations behind breillat s brave  troubled work  few movies have so effectively conveyed the alienation of adolescence  and the way children can be driven almost mad by their separation from life and love  
195,behind_the_sun,a dreary aristotelian tragedy whose contemporary geopolitical relevance cannot compensate for the lack of gripping protagonists  a worthy but somewhat less than satisfying follow up to the oscar nominated central station  
196,chopper,you wonder why anyone even bothered  bana radiates the sort of warped charisma that explains how an ultraviolent convict could capture the public s imagination  dominik doesn t glamorize or glorify chopper  but his film contributes to making mark brandon read as mythical an australian rogue as ned kelly  
197,legally_blonde,bombshell discovers her brainy side in fun romp for teens   they ve devised a potentially rich premise  only to play it safe  smoothing off every sharp edge and dumbing down any acerbic point  as an actor of distinction who s all of 25  reese witherspoon reveals interesting dark roots even as she plays golden girls  starts heading nowhere after the first half hour  and careers and flounders badly until it gets there  doesn t offer enough occasions for real spontaneous laughter to justify the cost of a full price ticket  
198,made,unfortunately  vaughn repeatedly crosses the line between persuasively playing an obnoxious character and coming across as nerve gratingly self indulgent  leaves you wishing they hadn t tried so hard to do something different  
199,baby_boy,the characters are so full bodied and the feelings so raw and complex that i d call this the best thing john singleton has done to date johnson and rhames are superb as jody s charming  hard working mother and her ex con boyfriend melvin  i felt myself drawn into a vortex of raw emotion from which i could not escape  one of the most entertaining african american comedies of manners ever made  pootie tang this ain t  good acting lends some balance to director s liking for sermons  if only singleton had filtered baby boy s passion through the ideas of real deep thinkers on this subject  he might yet fulfill the great promise that he showed us back when he was a 23 year old baby boy wonder himself  baby boy is a movie that will act like a smack in the face to some audiences  while others may simply laugh in recognition

204,rivers_and_tides_andy_goldsworthy_working_with_time,an absorbing portrait of a unique artist s professional and personal communion with nature  andy cuts an eccentric but likeable figure genuinely at a loss to explain where his inspiration comes from  we grab at beauty while simultaneously realizing it never can be possessed  a feeling brilliantly captured in this thoughtful and rewarding movie  the sort of film that sounds completely kooky until you see it  at which point it s still pretty kooky  but you realize just how cool kooky can still be  watching goldsworthy painstakingly piece together his artwork  we come to realize that his artistry lies as much in the act of creation as in the fleeting final product  a calm and lovely film that audiences hungry for beauty will likely devour with their eyes  watch this film  you may never look at nature indifferently again  i know of no documentary on a contemporary artist that conveys so much about the artist s work so lyrically and directly  
205,man_without_a_past,after watching it  i wasn t too sure myself if my choices would be any different than those m makes  he has no clue as to the life he s led  only feelings that tell him he wasn t the type of man he necessarily wanted to be  deliciously slow paced film  a gentle  surprising little movie whose rewards lie in what its characters don t say as much as in what they do  a compassionate and darkly funny shaggy dog story  
206,pianist,the fact that the director never once caves into easy sentiment or cheap hectoring is almost as amazing as the story itself  we admire this film for its harsh objectivity and refusal to seek our tears  our sympathies  brody tracks szpilman s descent from smug celebrity to feral  starving man with uncommon subtlety

209,about_a_boy,even people who don t usually like hugh grant will be charmed by him in the scrappy  slightly scandalous comedy about a boy  mainstream comedies should all be this funny and tender and deftly performed  hugh grant hilariously redefines the word  playboy  in the first half of this film  then gets human  without losing his comic edge  under the influence of the title waif  pleasant and engaging  rather than laugh out loud funny or emotionally involving  few movies have made better use of hugh grant s shallow charm and amused befuddlement than this funny and well paced adaptation of nick hornby s best selling second novel  the first big studio movie of 2002 i didn t want to end  hornby s crises and characters can be so facile  schematic and smugly moralistic that emotional substance can get overshadowed by fluff  the movie occasionally strains for crowd pleasing moments as it pumps up the drama toward the end  but it more than earns our indulgence  i loved the novel and i love what they did with it  
210,monsoon_wedding,a late radical shift in tone  from jittery exuberance to ruinous alienation  strikes an impressive contemporary note amid all the obeisance to custom  the impression of cosmopolitan modern india  of diaspora lives thrown into collision and collusion  is engaging in itself  but the emotional optimism here is the most heartening aspect of this vivacious film  some movies present an idealized view of marriage and family  others seem eager to debunk it  mira nair s exuberant art house crowd pleaser takes the third way  at heart  the film is not that far removed from a well written soap opera  but its modern day delhi setting and its cultural subtexts make up for the pat familiarity of its situations  nair achieves her usual level of dramatic competence  a teeming ensemble comedy shot fast and cheap but with such gorgeous colors and music and swirling silks that you leave with a feeling of riches  of superabundance  nair assuredly navigates the narrative and its characters with minimal confusion  although this steady hand seems a bit languorous at times  monsoon wedding does what altman s own the wedding could not  it allows us to celebrate a questionably blessed occasion without feeling embarrassed or complicit in some traditional scam  pulsates with unforgettable characters and only in delhi comedic situations  provides a visually dazzling and deeply affectionate glimpse of the tensions and traditions that animate much of modern indian life  
211,1114154-insomnia,dormer has a weariness that pacino wears perfectly  always finding some new depth to his exhaustion and despair without ever being a sleepy presence on screen  insomnia is not so much about the murder mystery as it is about will s internal struggle with what s right and what s possibly okay  the film represents a triumph of atmosphere over a none too mysterious mystery  which is to say that nolan makes you feel the end of the earth bleakness of his setting  makes you feel the way it can discombobulate people once they internalize it  with a run of the mill bad guy actor playing chief suspect walter finch  the movie might have tipped too far pacino s way  but robin williams is a shockingly effective counterweight  scene by scene  screenwriter hillary seitz follows director erik skjoldbjaerg s original closely  but this remake deepens and improves upon the norwegian film by giving dormer a more complex relationship with eckhart  as pacino endures day after day without a wink of sleep  insomnia skillfully turns the screws  delving further into his troubled mind as it s haunted by past and present sins  as well as deceptive visions that seem to bleed out of his conscience  while it may not be as stylistically idiosyncratic as memento insomnia is a gripping  highly dramatic thriller that more than confirms the distinctive talent of young brit helmer christopher nolan  pacino is on world beating form and williams delivers his best straight performance yet  this could this be the big sleep for a new generation  it s a crafty story told with more style and gray areas than your average thriller  the hollywood version  which is half an hour longer  transports the action to alaska  and works up a respectable level of bleary eyed paranoia  nolan proves that he can cross swords with the best of them and helm a more traditionally plotted popcorn thriller while surrendering little of his intellectual rigor or creative composure  
212,minority_report,high concept science fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing  but spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves  hugely ambitious and wildly successful in parts  only a tricky third act trips up a master director clearly enjoying himself in virgin territory  nonetheless this stands as the best future noir since blade runner  
213,spiderman,to me the only marvel about this marvel comics cinema hero is that americans should be going to see him in such large numbers  it s the unexpectedness of finding a genuine couple of young lovers caught in its web that turns spectacle into sympathy and restores life size emotion to outside imagination  with earnest  unpretentious delivery  maguire is an eminently likable hero audiences will root for from his earliest moments as the class wimp  the perils and advantages of being bitten by a genetically modified spider are made abundantly clear in sam raimi s enjoyable  if broken backed  exercise in high cost pulp  fun movie  but may be too intense for younger kids  even at its most generic  raimi s amiable movie doesn t forget its human scale  a perfectly serviceable early summer popcorn picture that will satisfy its core teen constituency and not displease general viewers looking for some disposable entertainment  practically pitch perfect summer entertainment  this accomplished blockbuster announces itself as a stylish piece of pop myth spinning  full of deftly handled small moments and characters  with his big  round  soulful eyes  maguire always has been able to convey a sense of wonder  and his instinct for understatement also serves him well here  
214,1118700-adaptation,adult stuff only but hilarious and fresh  both kaufmans are played by nicolas cage  whose goofy  moon faced sincerity has never been put to funnier use  few recent movies have conveyed so forcefully how people can feel shut out by their own lack of passion  how they yearn to end the emptiness

216,trials_of_henry_kissinger,in a larger sense  this powerfully muckraking film is about the accountability of public figures and about how  in regard to international justice  there can be no exceptions  eugene jarecki amasses a compelling body of evidence suggesting that kissinger should be formally investigated for a possible role in the cia supported coup  even if the case against kissinger is not fully convincing  the documentary keeps you glued to your seat and thinking long after you ve left the theater  scores by marshaling facts that speak for themselves  and they don t speak kindly  takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze  deploying a seamless blend of talking head interviews  trenchant archival photographs and newsreels  topped off by a sheaf of newly declassified u s  government documents  gibney and jarecki are smart enough to let the evidence and experts do the talking  not everyone will welcome or accept the trials of henry kissinger as faithful portraiture  but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one  enjoyably fast moving  hard hitting documentary  
217,infernal_affairs,the pace and plot are dizzying  but the movie also works as a study of fractured identity  the two have led double lives so long they re no longer sure who they are  ultimately quiet tepid  it overflows with psychological intrigue  something often missing from such offerings  
218,talk_to_her,almodovar uses the characters  unlikely predicaments to show how we define ourselves by narration  but his story is so overdetermined that ultimately the two men seem as constrained as their brain dead sweethearts  you ll end up moved  
219,bloody_sunday,the handheld camerawork and bleached out color palette suggest something more akin to combat footage  and candid moments recorded on the sly give bloody sunday a chilling realism  greengrass has achieved such immediacy that it s hard to believe that what we re watching isn t really unfolding before our eyes  
220,broken_wings_2002,this is a story that would be compelling  no matter what the locale  it s not until the film is over that we fully appreciate the originality of an israeli film that focuses completely on the family crisis while leaving politics behind altogether  broken wings has heart and a poetic soul  bergman s debut feature is tender yet disturbing  sad yet at times funny  well made  if rather predictable  new age melodrama  writer director bergman s debut doesn t have stylistic pizazz  and some of its scenes sag a little under the weight of mournful music  but the story is told with stirring simplicity that builds momentum  the performances are uniformly strong  broken wings tells the kind of story that only a cinematic neophyte would find novel  but it tells that story with such emotional nuance  and with such fine performances  that it somehow feels fresh  while there s nothing ordinary about bergman s accomplished family story  the line resonates with the director s own philosophy  a believable  tender story of how a terrible crisis can turn out to have a positive  transforming effect on a family as long as there is love  maron  a lovely young actress with a gift for soulful silence  does some heartbreaking work  broken wings is not a great film  but it s a good  solid one that should connect with intelligent audiences as strongly here as it did abroad  a sensitive and well observed drama that  while not breaking new ground  marks its director screenwriter as someone to watch  this intimate  warmly made family portrait always feels true  it sounds like a depressing little framework  but the actors give it life  
221,nine_queens,story and style both keep viewers on their toes  driven by a plot that s so tightly wound  we cannot look away for wanting to know what will happen next and who is double crossing whom  if nine queens draws you on a journey that eventually leads up a garden path toward your own suckerhood  it s all the more pleasurable for having done so with such slick expertise  
222,open_hearts,an emotionally honest character piece that avoids moralizing or offering soggy excuses  
223,kid_stays_in_the_picture,this movie is more fun than many of those tall tales that hollywood calls feature films  an engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger than life character  should delight anyone who ever wondered how tinseltown really works  the thing about guys like evans is this  you re never quite sure where self promotion ends and the truth begins  but as you watch the movie  you re too interested to care  even if you don t emerge from the film ready to worship at his beverly hills altar  you wind up liking the guy  hugely entertaining from start to finish  featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves  it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels  
224,chicago,chicago s so engrossing that you even forget to reach out for the coke n  popcorn  now isn t that entertainment  whatever one s qualms about the material  its execution here is rock solid in ways that keep on impressing  right through to the niftiest end credits sequence in years  chicago becomes less of a literal skewering of how celebrity criminals manipulate a rigged game  and more of a pure fantasy  not meant to be taken seriously  as sentimental as a plywood casket  chicago has satirical bite and a mean wit that somehow never obscures its characters  unlikely likability  rob marshall s screen version of the near venerable show looks great  in its razzly dazzly neo fosse way  and sounds good  especially when renee zellweger s gorgeous roxie hart is singing her heart out  the song and dance numbers are calisthenic but unspectacular  with too much fast cutting  and the tone throughout is harmlessly facetious  chicago has so much razzle dazzle that viewers may end up both raised and dazed  it s remorselessly inventive  trying anything fast and sassy to keep you watching  oscar winning satire all about the razzle dazzle  this oscar laden movie rendition  directed by rob marshall  suffers from the kind of ants in your pants mtv editing that prevents you from simply watching and enjoying the musical numbers  marshall betrays the dancing by never letting us see it properly  extremely enjoyable  although it says it all about the 2003 oscars that this was a winner  
225,scratch_2002,pray has really done his subject justice  pray s subjects can wander off into arcane dennis miller esque rants  but he manages to hit the high points and most of the major personalities  should appeal to more than just hardcore hip hop fans  pray has managed to create a historical document accessible enough for novices and credible enough for aficionados  does what a fine documentary does best  it extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world  then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively  if you  like me  have never been convinced that spinning and mixing other people s records requires a musical skill  these guys will educate you as they twiddle and tweak like amped up octopi  
226,atanarjuat_the_fast_runner_2002,   a gorgeous landscape movie shot in digital video  which  since it gives equal focus to everything in the frame  turns out to be a terrific medium for depicting the vast  undifferentiated ice fields of the great north  in a time of decadent visual clutter  the stark beauty of these arctic landscapes is bracing  the performances of all the roles are better than we might have expected  sincerity pulses throughout  the assurance from these people that they are enacting a legend that is significant to them  from its mystical mythical opening to the stunning finale  this is storytelling at its most primal and filmmaking at its most original  compelling as it is exotic  fast runner has a plot that rivals shakespeare for intrigue  treachery and murder  it may be the most satisfying experience you ll have at the movies this year  the kind of primal storytelling that george lucas can only dream of  few three hour films manage to be so engaging  or so vast  an experience so engrossing it is like being buried in a new environment  a landmark movie that becomes a priceless entryway into a distant land and its people  few of whom will ever seem as foreign and far away again  it takes us to a world we ve never seen  to tell us a story both entirely foreign and completely familiar  at nearly three hours long  it s an endurance test  both a thrilling adventure about endurance and survival  and an elegiac examination of centuries old tribal culture  fast fading in the new millennium  the film is filled with unquestionable grace and power  one of the most enthralling three hours you ll ever spend at the theater  
227,standing_in_the_shadows_of_motown,the funk brothers seem to have hardly missed a beat  there have been better documentaries to come out this year  but none can touch this one for unadulterated pleasure  try as you might to resist  if you ve got a place in your heart for smokey robinson  this movie will worm its way there  you may not end up dancing in the street  but don t be surprised if you cut a step or two in the parking lot  the movie lets us realize this sound  still so alive and vibrant today  was created by flesh and blood people  each of whom has a compelling story to tell  when all is said and done  there ain t no mountain high enough that should keep you from getting to this movie  when the old guys sit around and tell their stories  standing in the shadows of motown catches magic on the screen    a behind the curtain peek at some of the world s best loved music  straight from the cats who made it happen  after watching it  you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no nonsense human beings they are and for the still inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history  gives credit where credit s due  
228,the_weather_underground,if names such as bernadine dohrn  bill ayers  mark rudd  naomi jaffe and brian flanagan mean nothing to you  you ll definitely want to see the thought provoking documentary  the weather underground  directors sam green and bill siegel expertly limn the forces that gave rise to weatherman and clearly sympathize with the group s motivations  at the same time  they don t stint on weatherman s follies  whose side the documentarians are on is never clear    in a muddy rather than an ambiguous way  did anyone die from the weathermen s bombings  we don t find out here  an eye opening look at idealism taken to extremes during one of the most turbulent periods of american history  what s forceful about the weather underground is how effectively the filmmakers convey the violent zeitgeist of those years  a compelling piece of work that turns out to have unexpected relevance to the current world situation  a fascinating window into american political history  the weather underground chronicles those early days of idealism  and their transition into a period when american society seemed for an instant on the point of revolution  what it needs is more context  social and psychological  powerful and surprisingly timely  this terrifically smart and solid piece of filmmaking lets the former weathermen  now in their 50 s and older  speak into the camera and reveal a bit of their personal histories as well as what the peace movement meant to them  filmmakers sam green and bill siegel tend to shy from tough questions  allowing their subjects to wax nostalgic about bomb throwing as yet another youthful folly of the  70s  sam green and bill siegel s often gripping documentary manages to evoke the particular quality and extent of the madness that possessed many americans during the course of the longest foreign war in the nation s history  
229,alias_betty,miller tells this very compelling tale with little fuss or noise  expertly plucking tension from quiet  at heart the movie is a deftly wrought suspense yarn whose richer shadings work as coloring rather than substance  
230,lantana,lawrence cast well and gets terrific performances all the way up and down the line  solving the mystery of the dead body would be enough for most hollywood movies  in lantana  it s merely a device to launch us into more rewarding explorations  lantana is so rich in secondary characters and performances it s hard to mention them all  but you will certainly appreciate them  the thorns in this film prick real blood  the color of which too few films can or care to examine  it is fine stuff indeed  has a refreshingly keen ability to see everything from multiple angles  remarkably non bummer viewing  bleak as its outlook is  it s not so much psychodrama as psychocomedy of manners  after seeing  lapaglia  in lantana  no one will ever look at him without recognizing an actor of the first rank  
231,rabbitproof_fence,its adult themes of familial separation and societal betrayal are head and shoulders above much of the director s previous popcorn work  the movie may sound like a yawn  three girls walk through wind and rain and scrub brush to get back where they belong  but it s not  one of 2002 s most memorable imports  sampi rarely faces the camera  her gaze eludes us  but her strength and willfulness jump off the screen  noyce creates a film of near hypnotic physical beauty even as he tells a story as horrifying as any in the heart breakingly extensive annals of white on black racism  
232,murderous_maids,sylvie testud gives such a ferociously controlled performance that the messy murder seems like a necessary release  julie marie parmentier and sylvie testud are eerily convincing as the intense pair of co dependents in the rigorous but creepy drama murderous maids  convincingly played  but some way short of revelatory  never inspires more than an interested detachment  though far from a feel good affair  it is never cheap or cynical  its creepiness is well earned  made with spellbinding clarity and tact  shot near the actual locations by an uncompromising cinema realist  and featuring a near perfect cast  the story makes for an absorbing drama that builds in intensity  heading toward the ultimate outburst with a grim sense of inevitability  what  denis  accomplishes in his chilling  unnerving film is a double portrait of two young women whose lives were as claustrophic  suffocating and chilly as the attics to which they were inevitably consigned  murderous maids may well be the most comprehensive of these films and also strike closest to the truth  ultimately too repellent to fully endear itself to american art house audiences  but it is notable for its stylistic austerity and forcefulness  what denis ends up with is a delicate psychological portrait in which his grim determination to be restrained and sensitive is the major feature  denis forges out of the theories of class  based rage and sisterly obsession a razor sided tuning fork that rings with cultural  sexual and social discord  it presents the papin sisters  lives with ferocious clarity  shedding a painful light on emotions too volatile to be named and on actions that ultimately defy explanation  
233,russian_ark,part pageant and museum tour  part theme park ride and historical meditation  
234,the_girl_from_paris,offers proof that silences can speak volumes  the plot is so predictable and sentimental that viewers are likely to lose interest before sandrine and her goats walk off into the sunset  
235,cockettes,joyously re creates the brief but resplendent reign of the legendary freakadelic drag troupe  cockettes has the glorious  gaudy benefit of much stock footage of those days  featuring all manner of drag queen  bearded lady and lactating hippie  as weber and weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve  the cockettes weren t as much about gender  sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel  connect and create  an insightfully cheeky entertainment  this expert  heartfelt movie establishes them as being as much a part of swingin  san francisco as the grateful dead or the beats  manages to transcend the sex  drugs and show tunes plot into something far richer  it celebrates the group s playful spark of nonconformity  glancing vividly back at what hibiscus grandly called his  angels of light   an irresistible documentary look at the ensemble of the moment in the hippie kingdom of san francisco  this comprehensive and charming film not only recalls those days exactly  it also manages the wonderful trick of taking us back there along with it  it turns out there is quite a lot that the endlessly recycled and diluted images of the storied counterculture have obscured about some of the most interesting and vital parts of the culture itself  which the filmmakers have brought triumphantly to life  a sweet natured reconsideration of one of san francisco s most vital  if least widely recognized  creative fountainheads  
236,roger_dodger,we journey from appreciating roger as the ideal over drinks conversationalist to someone we would cross the street to avoid  scott s low key portrayal makes roger interesting  roger is not a character we are really meant to like  but how much one likes this movie may ultimately depend on the extent to which you are able to remain in the same room with him  doesn t really add up to much  the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing  an unusually smartly written and performed american independent film  
237,about_schmidt,these filmmakers have a feeling for the isolation of blasted lives  but they also can t resist putting them down  nicholson  emphatically off autopilot and acting entirely without vanity  perfectly captures schmidt s fear  loneliness and fervent hope that his life is worth more than he s come to assume  the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt s  no matter if it s viewed as a self reflection or cautionary tale  a road trip of self discovery  by turns hilarious and poignant  for a man unexpectedly at odds with the tiny world he has so laboriously made  
238,baran,more timely than its director could ever have dreamed  this quietly lyrical tale probes the ambiguous welcome extended by iran to the afghani refugees who streamed across its borders  desperate for work and food  
239,lilo_and_stitch,regrettably  towards the end the film veers off into a mess of weird aliens and cartoon network silliness  all the sentiment and charm you d expect from a disney movie  but easier to swallow thanks to mature themes and realistic characters  cheerful but below par  an entertaining and  three cheers  modest bauble that eschews most of the blockbuster trappings that have been strangling animated features in the past few years  a refreshingly low tech cartoon  mostly the film is just hectic and homiletic  two parts exhausting men in black mayhem to one part family values  this movie is by no means a classic in absolute artistic terms  but as a reaffirmation of all but forgotten verities it s an unqualified success  fresh and rainbowy as a midday hawaiian sun shower  with its feel good plot  superior art direction and memorable characters  lilo   stitch could well become one of those timeless disney classics  one that sticks around for decades and never loses its appeal  for all the weighty issues involved  this movie remains very entertaining  full of elvis songs and scenes that will make both parents and kids laugh  a tiresome feature that could be made into a wonderful 20 minute film  a beguiling splash of pastel colors and prankish comedy from disney  by turns endearing and hilarious  lilo   stitch is proof the folks at disney should break their own rules more often  
240,lovely_and_amazing,michelle isn t an easy woman to relate to let alone like  yet as the film progresses i was drawn more and more towards her inner warmth and charm discovering pieces of myself in her own persona  
241,late_marriage,a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores  a terrific  thoroughly engrossing motion picture  one of those welcome visitors  a movie that turns out to be much more than we expected  a closely observed  somewhat funny  ultimately very sad movie  late marriage s stiffness is unlikely to demonstrate the emotional clout to sweep u s  viewers off their feet  ashkenazi and elkabetz are sensational in the lead roles  unfolds in a low key  organic way that encourages you to accept it as life and go with its flow  an unforgettable look at morality  family  and social expectation through the prism of that omnibus tradition called marriage  it feels like a devastatingly honest portrait of how old world family loyalties are both a haven and a prison    for two generations  a seriocomic debut of extravagant promise by georgian israeli director dover kosashvili  late marriage is not a one level film  and one of its most revealing moments shows the strong minded mother expressing respect for the equally iron willed judith  judith and zaza s extended bedroom sequence     is so intimate and sensual and funny and psychologically self revealing that it makes most of what passes for sex in the movies look like cheap hysterics  will assuredly rank as one of the cleverest  most deceptively amusing comedies of the year  features one of the most affecting depictions of a love affair ever committed to film  
242,i_am_trying_to_break_your_heart,woven together handsomely  recalling sixties  rockumentary milestones from lonely boy to don t look back  jones has crafted a natty narrative that  enhanced by erin nordstrom s editing  is filled with payoffs  an exciting and involving rock music doc  a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world

244,monsters_ball,the best thing marc forster s direction does is take these characters through their experiences at a convincingly naturalistic respiratory rate    
245,1120292-spider,although languid to a fault  spider offers some payoff for those with enough patience to stick it out  definitely a trip into unexplored territory  spider isn t nearly as disturbing as it is intriguing  despite its subject matter  a dark  brilliant journey into memory and schizophrenia whose peeled back layers reveal an unexpected heroism  cronenberg manages a scrupulously constructed version of mcgrath s novel about a schizophrenic  a restrained and elegant piece of work from a director whose name is more readily associated with goo and gore  an eensy weensy movie sustained by two utterly gigantic performances  cold as the film may seem  cronenberg s nightmare talent has rarely been at such a high  terrifying boil  
246,bourne_identity,liman takes a giant step toward hackdom with his banal big budget adaptation of robert ludlum s 1980 espionage thriller  
247,24_hour_party_people,rave and dance music aficionados will be pleased to see an important chapter in their cultural history  a formally dazzling  breathlessly profane love letter to punk attitude that recalls every rockumentary from a hard day s night to this is spinal tap while remaining fiercely  defiantly original  winterbottom captures the spirit of the times  although the film s camera shakes and psychedelic colour bursts may make many viewers feel like reaching for gravol rather than ecstasy  great good fun even if you spent the 1980s listening to loverboy

250,blind_spot_hitlers_secretary,you almost feel as if satan s personal assistant had decided to pull up a chair and tell all  is it possible not to be interested  for junge  even 60 years later she still has trouble forgiving the 22 year old woman she once was for being seduced by that influence  makes us wonder  in a very human sense  about the various blinders we all adopt to make our peace with life  you won t take your eyes off frau junge s pale  intent face  as in a steady voice she tells an astonishing tale  a chilling documentary that draws its impact purely on junge s personal testimony  perhaps most distressing to subject and audience alike is the way one can be at the epicenter of history and still remain blind  both because the actual evil is happening elsewhere and because it s easier to not look  
251,lawless_heart,shows us small revelations only an opened heart can grasp  
252,one_hour_photo,one hour photo is a very well made thriller  it shows us robin williams extending his acting range into unusual and disturbing material  and as well as causing acute anxiety in its last reels  it delivers a more moral message than most of its kind  this immaculately made first feature from noted musicvid and commercials director mark romanek provides robin williams with one of his creepiest  atypical roles  and the comic star responds with an unusually restrained performance    it has arresting things to say about how the family photo is used less to record than to project  and how far that projection can be from the truth  robin williams has thankfully ditched the saccharine sentimentality of bicentennial man in favour of an altogether darker side  not entirely satisfying as either a creepfest or a character study  the craftsmanship is so strenuously neat that every frame should be awarded a gold star  but there isn t a breath of spontaneous life  ranks among willams  best screen work  it begins by scaring you to death by evoking a monster  and by the end it has seduced you into caring for him  for all its merits  one hour photo winds up as just another exercise in genre  although an assured and effective one  williams finally gets a role so smartly written we forget not only that we are watching williams the dramatic actor  but that we are watching williams at all  a thought provoking  artful accomplishment by writer director mark romanek  who reveals a powerfully understated vision of the haunting loneliness behind the forced cheerfulness of the discount store  
253,metropolis_2002,unlike most anime  whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes  metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile  has an almost stupefyingly intense visual impact  
254,road_to_perdition,the film feels alternately cloaked in heavy wood paneling or soaked in cold chi town slush  
255,the_royal_tenenbaums,the tenenbaums s self referential outlook  wayward agendas  wanton destructiveness and wishful fantasy make for a highly entertaining spectacle  provided you acknowledge you re watching a churning status quo that will never alter in essentials  while the situations sometimes feel forced  anderson has mounted an elegant production  beautifully filmed and accentuated by pleasant narration from alec baldwin and classy storybook transitions  quirky extended family story with dry adult humor  
256,son_of_the_bride,it would seem that wherever there are middle class  midlife crises to be suffered  there are movies to be made about those crises  and they somehow all manage to transcend their local trappings in favour of a kind of borderless emotional banality  what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers  jose campanella delivers a loosely autobiographical story brushed with sentimentality but brimming with gentle humor  bittersweet pathos  and lyric moments that linger like snapshots of memory  
257,la_stanza_del_figlio,like a good shrink  moretti watches with an unflinching but compassionate eye  we are given characters so gentle and so human that we become instantly fond of them  moretti is interested in simple behavior  captured at a polite but insightful distance  and this quiet  subtly moving drama says more about the qualities that make us human with a whisper than most other movies can say with a shout  stands apart for its raw  quiet emotion and its shattering sense of truth  
258,springtime-in-a-small-town,only a director who truly knows repression could have made a movie so subtle and so understanding  reinventing his source just as boldly as he has reinvented his artistic identity  tian circumvents the usual mentality of remakes by making his material brand new  tian gets superbly nuanced performances from an inexperienced cast and choreographs his ensemble scenes with considerable self assurance  a gorgeous love story set in a battle scarred house in china in the spring following the end of world war ii  although its tone is more dreamy than steamy  this film oddly seems a product from the same heated template as a william inge or tennessee williams drama of the early 1950 s  exquisitely made love story  which marks the welcome return after 10 years of inactivity by director tian zhuangzhuang  well served by the performances of its lead trio  all are relative newcomers to film acting  yet they subtly convey the suppressed longings beneath their characters  polite faades  this is tastefully boring festival fare  strictly for those who like their movies slow and their subtitles prominent  connoisseurs of chinese film will be pleased to discover that tian s meticulous talent has not withered during his enforced hiatus  
259,good_girl,white hasn t developed characters so much as caricatures  one dimensional buffoons that get him a few laughs but nothing else  
260,barbershop,the script really should have been given a trim  as it tries to cram in so many characters that few are given the time and space to develop  in the age of photo messaging and web chats  barbershop is a warm hearted reminder that there s nothing like conversation between real people  a flat out hilarious ensemble comedy that probably made me laugh out loud more than any other movie this year  towers head and hairpiece above much of what passes for urban comedy these days  
261,kissing_jessica_stein,venturesome yet unthreatening  this movie is box office smart enough to seem cutting edge without ever drawing blood  
262,elling,rather than real figures  elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naf s encounter with the world  ellefsen and nordin originated their roles on an oslo stage  resulting in two lived in character portrayals which lend this offbeat comedy a sweet sincerity  that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions  defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks  
263,real_women_have_curves,though i fault real women s clumsy execution  its message will continue to resonate until scenes where women clutch their thick midsections in celebration are no longer exceptional  there is more joy in two frames of cardaso s film than most mainstream comedies can muster in 90 minutes  it s anchored by splendid performances from an honored screen veteran and a sparkling newcomer who instantly transform themselves into a believable mother daughter pair  
264,morvern_callar,ultimately provides little resolution for our tough heroine  and the way the film visualizes this discontent continues to haunt at least one viewer  maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one room world for a while  even if both films are about accidental sinners  morvern callar turns out to be a very different  and more difficult  film than ratcatcher  too often mistaking obscurity for complexity and moodiness for depth  director lynn ramsay squanders an intriguing premise and a layered performance by samantha morton  
265,margaret-cho-notorious-cho,a hit  and miss affair  consistently amusing but not as outrageous or funny as cho may have intended or as imaginative as one might have hoped  she needs us far more than we need her  
266,the_believer,an exploration of what it means to be jewish and what it means to hate   two separate subjects that happen to overlap in this case  one of the year s most thought provoking  hard hitting films  gutsily opening up a subject rarely done with this kind of all out chutzpah  a somewhat crudely constructed but gripping  questing look at a person so racked with self loathing  he becomes an enemy to his own race  easily the most thoughtful fictional examination of the root causes of anti semitism ever seen on screen  an amazing and incendiary movie that dives straight into the rough waters of contradiction  mr  bean s diagnosis of jewish self hatred in the believer may be misdirected in the present circumstances  
267,punchdrunk_love,odd romantic journey for adults and older teens  nothing makes much sense  and the watson character would have run a mile from sandler  who performs like jerry lewis at his least endearing  anderson has a firm grip on sandler s dangerous essence and draws it out in an astonishing performance  audiences are likely to feel a bit punch drunk themselves as they try to make sense of this odd romantic journey with its offbeat dualities  combining extremes of chaos and harmony and love and anger  the journey toward redemption feels more like a cinematic experiment than a full blown movie  despite its title  punch drunk love is never heavy handed  the jabs it employs are short  carefully placed and dead center  punch drunk love knows how to reap epic delight from the most precious of details   anderson  uses a hit or miss aesthetic that hits often enough to keep the film entertaining even if none of it makes a lick of sense  director paul thomas anderson hasn t reinvented sandler  he s just allowed those of us who tired very quickly of his innocent naif shtick to see how effectively it can be put in the service of something to care about  everything about punch drunk love works in a being john malkovich sort of way save one  sandler  when your star doesn t work  it s hard to get us to buy into the rest of a movie as unusual as this  in punch drunk love  adam sandler doesn t so much discard his old persona as illuminate it  breathing life into the cardboard characters that populated his earlier films  how odd that a tribute to a wildly theatrical presence should turn out so dull and prosaic  
268,hours,david hare s screen adaptation reduces woolf and her art to a set of feminist stances and a few plot points  without reference to style or form  as stunning an acting showcase as you ll find  the acting  for the most part  is terrific  although the actors must struggle with the fact that they re playing characters who sometimes feel more like literary conceits than flesh and blood humans  virtually humorless and extremely talky  the movie takes place during one day in each woman s life  although it moves so slowly it often feels like a week  
269,stuart_little_2,no doubt  it can be a perfect escapist fare if you re riddled with self doubts and is fairly delightful even though you know that the reality outside the 70 odd minutes is not so rosy  at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth  it reminds us that nathan lane is the best show stealer in show business  
270,1117377-all_or_nothing,mike leigh goes spelunking in search of the english soul  finds gold  for close to two hours the audience is forced to endure three terminally depressed  mostly inarticulate  hyper dysfunctional families for the price of one  the film feels uncomfortably real  its language and locations bearing the unmistakable stamp of authority  leigh makes these lives count  and he allows a gawky actor like spall    who could too easily become comic relief in any other film    to reveal his impressively delicate range  the more you think about the movie  the more you will probably like it  with one exception  every blighter in this particular south london housing project digs into dysfunction like it s a big  comforting jar of marmite  to be slathered on crackers and served as a feast of bleakness  leigh has created another remarkable work  up there with his best  leigh s sympathy for the working poor is unmistakable and unassailable  but the tragic grandeur with which he imbues their pain hovers dangerously close to condescension  we re back on the social and emotional turf that leigh knows best  these people are real as few movie characters ever are  grueling  heavy handed  and surprisingly insight free  leigh s daring here is that without once denying the hardscrabble lives of people on the economic fringes of margaret thatcher s ruinous legacy  he insists on the importance of those moments when people can connect and express their love for each other  a triumph  a film that hews out a world and carries us effortlessly from darkness to light  
271,drumline,outstanding cast  great message  strong language  offers little that s surprising or groundbreaking  but  because the script is smart enough not to insult us and to develop a group of interesting characters  the act of watching the film is an entertaining experience rather than a tedious exercise  i love that we get into this world of marching bands  we barely see any football players    we see the top of their helmets as they re getting out of the way  in the film  snappily directed by charles stone 3d  the marching bands  duels are as fun as the cheerleader wars in bring it on  maybe you ve seen most of these things before  but you ve rarely seen them in such an exuberant setting  rife with nutty cliches and far too much dialogue  drumline has a lower profile than almost any other holiday movie  yet it boasts a higher fun quotient than many of its more touted competitors  not exactly worth a drum roll but a movie with enough collegiate ka boom to earn its title  drumline is a percussion driven musical variation on every sports pic you ve seen about the talented hot dog who eventually learns to become a team player  
272,pauline_and_paulette,a worthwhile glimpse into how humans can begin to become whole  petersen and van der groen play affectingly against each other in this geriatric heartwarmer  
273,satin_rouge,the powder blues and sun splashed whites of tunis make an alluring backdrop for this sensuous and spirited tale of a prim widow who finds an unlikely release in belly dancing clubs  
274,better_luck_tomorrow,perpetuates another stereotype  the one about affluent suburban teens who have everything they could ever want but so lack a moral compass that even murder seems like just another extracurricular activity  
275,secret_ballot,the filmmaker s greatest achievement is that he avoids preaching or taking sides and deftly proves that the weightiest issues can still come tinged with humor and irony  babak payami s surreal  episodic road comedy holds our attention to alternating degrees  hamstrung by the flat footedness of his two leads  will amuse and provoke adventurous adults in specialty venues  
276,sunshine_state,a fiercely intelligent south florida mosaic  sunshine state resembles sayles  sketchbook more than his finished work  and we might hope that something more polished might spring from it  because we are so familiar with the conventional approach to a story like this  it takes time to catch on that sayles is not repeating the old progressive line about the little guy against big capital  
277,gigantic,prepare yourself for nights wandering around the house singing unshakable tunes  the flabby  fawning film gigantic comes across as 102 minutes of rib nudging by one of the duo s annoyingly self satisfied connoisseurs  as tooting your  own horn documentaries about innovative alt rockers who ve been around for 20 years go  gigantic  a tale of two johns goes very well indeed  musician syd straw unintentionally strikes truth when she sardonically asks about the film   is this more like a fluff piece   if you thought that the party down metalheads in the decline of western civilization ii were full of themselves  just wait until you enter the echo chamber of whimsical egomania that is alt rock attitude  
278,8_women,seduction is more important than deduction in this chic display of star quality to the eighth power  for all the tumultuous entrances and flouncing exits  the eight principals manage maybe three laughs among them  ozon s notion of derision is perfectly carried out by his multi generational name cast  some may find ozon s rigorously clever deconstruction of so many conventions a little too french for their tastes  but cineasts and worshippers of les femmes at their most fatales will find this farce wonderfully fierce  the film starts to feel like decorative misogyny  each performance is beautifully controlled  notably huppert s devastating comic turn as augustine  and integrated into a seamless ensemble  leave your sense of reason at the door and surrender yourself to the oo la laughs  for pure camp  intentional or otherwise  this is right up there with the rocky horror picture show  
279,antwone_fisher,devastating story of abuse based on real life  washington makes his directorial debut with antwone fisher  a fact based biography that deftly pulls the heartstrings  granted  it covers no new ground that other psychiatrist patient films haven t gone before  the acting helps push the movie past its familiarity into something that rings earnest and true  
280,wild_thornberrys_movie,screenwriter kate boutilier provides plenty of sharp patter  pretty good half term holiday fare  
281,tully,an uncommonly perceptive and finely shaded character drama  if you can push on through the slow spots  you ll be rewarded with some fine acting  
282,ice_age,in the time honored tradition of kids  films  ice age mixes broad displays of physical cruelty with a sweet message  which in this case is about the need of each member of a herd to look after the other  delivers solid laughs and thrills wrapped up in an infectious sense of character  there s enough classically derived road runner type fun to keep most family audiences happy  but the characters betray their contrivance  this prehistoric buddy pic has a heart bursting with good intentions  something that goes a long way in dimming from memory its inherent routineness  not as cute as it looks  real ice ages were no jokes  they lasted about 100 000 years and froze most life on the planet  but as long as leguizamo s sid and wedge s scrat are on screen  this one warms you with laughter  has neither the invention and creativity of monsters nor the satiric wit of shrek  but it still emerges as the best new family film of the season  you could do a lot worse for the easter holidays than this  yet another marvelously funny digital animation feature  ice age won t drop your jaw  but it will warm your heart  and i m giving it a strong thumbs up  it s clever enough to amuse adults  yet sufficiently kid friendly to delight tykes with diminutive attention spans  manages to remain consistently entertaining and delightful throughout  no evolutionary leap forward in the world of computer generated animation  just another palatable  familiar children s diversion in shiny new form  family entertainment at its most bright eyed and bushy tailed  full of visual dazzle  engaging characters and a reasonably sprightly narrative  
283,shanghai_ghetto,shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story  but you might want to think twice before booking passage  shanghai ghetto would make a good primer for high school students ignorant of pre  world war ii history  but in the entirety of holocaust cinema it is a blip on the radar  the mix of such fascinating events with the memories of those who endured them is undeniably compelling  even if much of what s described here has been described for decades  fairly artless even by the standards of talking heads documentaries  shanghai ghetto still proves fascinating  shanghai ghetto  much stranger than any fiction  brings this unknown slice of history affectingly to life  the film isn t especially dynamic  but it brims with insightful  poignant memories from survivors  shanghai ghetto may not be as dramatic as roman polanski s the pianist  but its compassionate spirit soars every bit as high  a salute to those who were blessed not only with savvy and courage  but something between an uncanny sense of foresight and an unforeseen stroke of good fortune  a touching documentary about jewish flight to china  this is riveting stuff  especially in its account of how refugee culture and community spring up almost overnight  all of this story is engrossing  especially because it unfolds something more than political data  
284,nicholas_nickleby_2002,pic separates itself out by hitting the humor as hard as the pathos  finding a nice contrast between the caricatures of the supporting roles and the dimensionality of the leads  above all other pleasures it offers  it provides a classic of literature and social criticism with a straight run through from start to finish  there s a bevy of hiss worthy baddies to pick up the dramatic slack  beginning with plummer s wonderfully nefarious uncle ralph  the film is enriched by an imaginatively mixed cast of antic spirits  headed by christopher plummer as the subtlest and most complexly evil uncle ralph i ve ever seen in the many film and stage adaptations of the work  a beguiling evocation of the quality that keeps dickens evergreen  the exuberant openness with which he expresses our most basic emotions  although nicholas nickleby occasionally evidences a simplicity that resembles a junior scholastic production  the movie s enthusiasm is contagious  it s just sort of there  one more adaptation of a long rambling charles dickens soap opera well stocked with respected british actors playing painfully stereotypical characters  if you really want a taste of this classic  rent the video of the rsc production  but if you re only looking for a charming time passer  this movie is just the thing  
285,undercover_brother,it s breezily entertaining and culturally specific without resorting to gross out jokes or cruelty  even during periods when the belly laughs subside  griffin continues to keep it really amusing with his exuberant flair for physical comedy and mock serious swagger  a colorful  cool and completely hilarious ride that ll have you rolling through the outtakes  
286,secretary,spader plays lee as if possessed by edward g  robinson   not from his gangster days  but rather from his time working with fritz lange in classic noirs like the woman in the window  playfully subversive and oddly life affirming  the cast comes through even when the movie doesn t  despite its flaws  secretary stays in your head and makes you question your own firmly held positions  a picture with heart  you shouldn t leave feeling soiled or bruised  just touched  self serious and ultimately pedestrian satire  i don t know about you  but i found all these outrageously romantic maneuvers both funny and endearing  both lead performances are earnest in the extreme and that the psychological explanations for what s shown on screen are facile  at best  
287,8_mile,while not exactly wow  eminem is solid and credible in a role which could so easily have screeched like chalk across a wet blackboard  it s easy to like jimmy smith as well as to admire him  because mr  mathers lets us in  with no sign of calculation  on the kindness  even tenderness  that jimmy conceals from most of the people around him  since his ascension to pop culture royalty  eminem has transformed the messy emotions of his life into musical black comedy  in 8 mile  that life becomes an equally riveting drama  despite the predictable formula  screenwriter scott silver wisely avoids taking the easy route every time  there are several small twists you may not expect  and the ending isn t entirely a happy one  because it rejects easy victories  this may be one of the few inspirational movies that could actually inspire someone  somewhere  sometime  a hesitant presence whose vulnerability pulls you in  eminem emerges as a mainstream movie star and effectively lays to rest the spooks of slim shady  impressionable parents will love this eminently responsible film  a solidly built  rather old fashioned yarn about a plucky underdog who triumphs in the face of adversity  i have to go back to james dean in elia kazan s east of eden and nicholas ray s rebel without a cause in 1955 to find a comparably jolting piece of male aggressiveness coupled with bottled up vulnerability  8 mile probably won t win converts to rap  but it should thrill eminem fans  so thumbs up  
288,changing_lanes,neither gipson nor banek makes much of a poster child for the danger of civilized behavior devolving into savagery  since neither of them seems quite stable from the outset  the ending is guaranteed to aggravate any self respecting new york driver  far richer than you d ever think possible  
289,last_orders,schepisi always handles actors sympathetically and here he has a perfect cast  most of whom can draw on their own and their parents  experiences  ambitious in structure and casting  it packs a lot into its screen time  quality craftsmanship for a discerning crowd  gathering its forces slowly  this careful  thoughtful film  quietly but deeply moving  is dramatic without seeming to be  a movie i loved on first sight and  even more important  love in remembrance  while the flashback structure through which the surviving characters relive the past may have worked in the novel  it doesn t work here on the screen  with a cast of this vintage  it wouldn t matter if they were reading the telephone book to one another  things are always entertaining  there s a wondrous sense of what all men should leave behind them  friendship  forgiveness and reconciliation  a warm  skillful excavation of what look like ordinary lives  ones that aren t so simple once you dig a little deeper  the lovely and richly textured british film last orders is as well acted as any film you ll ever see  an epic with the economy of an epitaph  a flawlessly told tale about a flawed man  there s been no richer cinematic tapestry of humanity so far this year  
290,signs,gibson is on top form  and there are some genuinely terrifying moments that will have you cowering behind your popcorn  
291,biggie_and_tupac,short on concrete evidence but long on compelling insinuation  compulsively watchable and endlessly inventive as it transforms broomfield s limited materials into a compelling argument  you don t need to know your ice t s from your cool j s to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned  something is rotten in the state of california  bristles with the sort of passion and bold purpose so often lacking in contemporary nonfiction filmmaking  nothing sticks  really  except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad  sordid universe of guns  drugs  avarice and damaged dreams  journalistically dubious  inept and often lethally dull  nick broomfield s dishonest film biggie and tupac solves nothing about the rap world s most notorious murders  a first person whodunit in which the filmmaker casts himself as a seedy gumshoe poking around a hallucinatory world in which poverty  crime  and drugs mix with fantastic wealth and grandiose scenarios lifted from the godfather and scarface  in exploring their deaths  broomfield sheds light on his subjects  lives and art  reminding us why their loss still reverberates and their albums still sell in the millions  broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black owned record label with a white empowered police force  
292,tadpole,the top notch cast brings the story to life with aplomb  most folks with a real stake in the american sexual landscape will find it either moderately amusing or just plain irrelevant  a movie that gets by on charm even when it s tippytoeing in taboo territory  tadpole was written in wisps and watery double entendres by heather mcgowan and niels mueller  and the movie is so benign that its proceedings are beside the point  
293,warm_water_under_a_red_bridge,simply doesn t have sufficient heft to justify its two hour running time  
294,panic_room,a thinking man s women in jeopardy picture  panic room does about as much as humanly possible with its deliberately restricted one setting premise  never averse to glistening darkness  meaty metaphor or grandiloquent technical display  fincher is also surprisingly at home with hokum  it might sometimes forget to make sense  but no matter  since it creates enough tension that the audience can hardly think anyway  
295,dangerous_lives_of_altar_boys,built for nothing but the laziest saturday afternoons  altar boys is zipless enough to seem to receive its narrative rhythms and emotional energy intravenously  
296,my_big_fat_greek_wedding,this will have all non greeks in the audience wishing they could lay claim to some mediterranean heritage  vardalos certainly has a strong screen presence  physical humor is her strong suit  though her script is considerably lazy  a simple but likeable film that points out its characters  foibles while retaining an affection for their eccentricities  
297,frida,salma hayek finally ushered her dream project into production  but her impassioned lead performance lacks the necessary gravitas for the role  mistaking empty energy for wild fits of inspiration  a few sublime and moving moments interrupting an otherwise pedestrian movie biography  the greatest movie about an artist since vincente minnelli grafted the psychological turmoil of vincent van gogh onto the screen in lust for life  
298,gangs_of_new_york,one of the most provocative films from hollywood in recent times  the visuals are strong  while the central narrative is weak  a disastrous combination for a long movie   worst of all  gangs of new york achieves far too little while trying much too hard  it s never less than compelling  driven by an overwhelming  larger than life performance from day lewis and by scorsese s grandiose historical imagination  at turns brilliant and ponderous  luminous and drab  this is the type of ethereal feast only america s greatest living director could attempt  n the end  you re left feeling that scorsese has put on a great show  as to what he means by it  i doubt he knows  an ironic  emotional  gory revision of the american experiment  marred by narrative problems but sufficiently awesome in its ambitious scale and intentions to rate as a must see  wonderful spectacle  terrific acting and toweringly great film making  the result reverberates on the screen with a deadly force and fury more intense than anything mr  scorsese has yet achieved on the meanest and most beloved streets he could imagine or recall  what we re left with has the patness of a history lesson about our roots and the melting pot and what it means to be an american  you have to honor its mad ambition  but sadly  it feels like a dream too long deferred  a triumph of pure craft and passionate heart  i m not convinced that there s anything more at the center of the finished picture than the director s own interest in the subject matter  for almost the first two thirds of martin scorsese s 168 minute gangs of new york  i was entranced  
299,comedian,demonstrates that even good comics aren t especially interesting when caught offstage  
300,finding_nemo,sweet father son tale with some very scary moments  
301,lost_in_translation,   its pretty images of tokyo and oddball intergenerational friendship coalesce into something unexpectedly moving    excellent but mature film about finding a connection  very much a mood piece  the film s deft balance of humor and poignancy makes it both a pleasurable and melancholy experience  with this film it becomes clear that sofia coppola is a filmmaker with eyes all her own  so far as the central relationship goes  the film is almost european in its subtlety and nuance  cinematic cherry blossom   murray  can still do more with a raised eyebrow than anyone since groucho marx  but he s mellower and sometimes slightly poignant  in japan  the most extreme delicacy goes hand in hand with garishness  and coppola offers up both for our delectation  it s a heady  hallucinatory combo  bill murray is one of the greatest  least ingratiating comic actors at work today  appropriately enough he once played a modern version of scrooge  there s not a word or a wistful glance out of place in sofia coppola s offbeat comedy drama  of course  mr  murray gets all the laughs with his exquisite timing and wry delivery  but ms  johansson makes an eloquent and charismatic listener  murray has never been better than he is here  but then he s never had a part that fit him so well  either  a stylish meditation on alienation and ennui  
302,the_lord_of_the_rings_the_return_of_the_king,some story strands are crudely abbreviated  others fail to develop elements that were already well established  
303,capturing_the_friedmans,there s no doubt that the film delivers the emotional equivalent of a kidney punch  but that s as much a result of the filmmaker s attitude better suited to entomological research as it is to the friedmans themselves  while with any number of    documentaries one can happily say  wait until it turns up on the small screen   with capturing the friedmans it is well worth sitting in the dark to find out the extent to which you think you are being deliberately kept there  it takes the concept of reality television and twists it into a shocking but poignant art form  watching this remarkable production is like going on safari to that creepy world  it s a fascinating place to visit  but you wouldn t  not for a minute  want to live there  the mpaa doesn t have a rating for queasy making and heartbreaking  if it did  then capturing the friedmans would carry an advisory  an experience you will never forget  a movie that will have you talking and thinking for hours  the year s most compelling cinematic conversation piece  a disquieting documentary about a disturbing incident  where so many  reality  shows shrink a subject down to snug  humiliating form  friedmans takes the opposite approach  a prime candidate for a time capsule  to disclose a century hence the current state of some of our civilization s discontents  including the ability to be convinced that one is telling the truth even when one is lying  
304,the_fog_of_war_eleven_lessons_from_the_life_of_robert_s_mcnamara,although errol morris s film takes us through the nasty dramas behind various wars  few of mcnamara s clarifications come as a surprise  a fascinating look into the mind of one of 20th century america s most controversial military figures an insanely timely cautionary tale about american omniscience and the fallible belief that rationality will always win out  the interviews were filmed a year before the war in iraq  that so many of mcnamara s lessons have come into play imbue the fog of war with an eerie clarity  
305,american_splendor,we re constantly kept on our toes regarding issues of representation while pekar s sour but indefatigible working class skepticism carries us along  
306,sweet_sixteen,using mostly unknown and first time actors  loach spins a passable coming of age tale  which should please his fans and provides a diversion for the rest of us  from its gripping immediacy to its strong cast of unknowns  sweet sixteen feels almost like a documentary  loach and screenwriter paul laverty keep an evenhanded focus on harsh truths  and avoid melodrama and grandstanding  there s a profane but strangely tender rawness to this sometimes brutal movie  anchored by compston s remarkably assured debut performance  compston s performance and the downer milieu  presented with appropriate paint peeling profanity  are more than enough to keep an audience riveted and ultimately moved close to tears  loach may be best known for staunchly political films like bread and roses  but in many ways sweet sixteen is a throwback to his other pictures  grittier slice of  life films like my name is joe  
307,raising_victor_vargas,peter sollett s remarkable movie about the lives and loves of latino teenagers in new york s lower east side is an unexpected treat  the narrative is thin  but the little known cast  who helped writer director peter sollett develop the characters  bring an element of realism to roles that defy stereotypes and pigeonholing  a satisfying motion picture that wins its audience over because the characters are allowed to be themselves  for those sick of the tired conventions of  rom coms   as hollywood wags call romantic comedies   vargas is a refreshing cure  frank about healthy teenage curiosity and sexuality in ways that don t make them punchlines to smutty jokes  there s nothing in the utterly enchanting raising victor vargas you haven t seen before  you d just be hard pressed to name another movie that did it as well  every frame of this movie feels real  raising victor vargas has landed exactly the right actors for a script that already gets points for respecting its teenage characters  a delightful example of what happens when a rather slight story is handled with passion  humor and care  first time writer director peter sollett  working with mostly nonprofessional actors who live in the neighborhood in which the film is set  has caught something lovely in that golden summer light  
308,chavez_inside_the_coup,remarkable true life footage makes this 74 minute film as potent as behemoths twice its size  
309,winged_migration,after seeing these natural wonders  the elaborate special effects of such films as the hulk and the matrix reloaded will seem like cheap parlor tricks  flight as sheer freedom couldn t be better demonstrated  a film that will leave you dreaming about what it would be like to step off the edge of the world and discover you could fly  whether we re seeing a startled flock taking sudden flight or zapping into a mountain lake to catch fish  our eye is constantly bedazzled  
310,station_agent,it feels less like a modern motion picture than some odd poem long lost and then discovered in another age  a timeless  ageless gem of hard resined emotions melting into real life  
311,the_triplets_of_belleville,the tone of this droll  thrillingly odd animated film isn t easy to describe   a tad dark for little kids  this one of a kind movie delivers 80 minutes of idiosyncratic inspiration  a wonderfully weird bit of french animation that amounts to little but a celebration of its creator s bountiful imagination  yet manages to enthrall because writer director sylvain chomet is such a solid visual storyteller  just when jeffrey katzenberg had loudly declared the death of 2 d animation  along came this sly  inventively drawn cartoon that blew the cumbrous studio leviathans out of the water  vous guessed it by now  triplettes is terrific  a winning blend of dark and bittersweet  aimed more at adults than kiddies  but suitable for all ages  relish the film s deadpan grotesquery  its flair for invention  be it the fanciful narrative segues or various object lessons    it s impossible to watch this movie without gasping at its graphics  and yet we re so drawn into chomet s way of seeing that  after a while  his genius erases the distinction between animation and live action  the triplets of belleville can feel so alive you may have trouble sitting still while watching it  triplets is as visually unfamiliar as a foreign language  triplets of belleville conjures up a world that s totally surprising and sublime  feels simultaneously cutting edge and a new classic of the cartoon genre  
312,to_be_and_to_have,it demonstrates without overreaching what an actual teacher can do to shape lives  a deceptively simple french film about teaching that keeps enlarging as you watch it  becoming beautiful and inspiring in a way most films never touch  this heart wrenching documentary about a french village schoolteacher at work offers the comedy and pathos of great drama and the visual magnificence of painting  exhibiting the same sort of patience as his sensible hero  philibert has created an extraordinarily humane portrait of a partnership between one adult and his very fortunate charges  
313,dirty_pretty_things,this hypnotic  chilling thriller deals with people living in the margins  in this case  london s exploited immigrants   steven knight s smart  if overly plotted  script delivers social insights tautly wrapped in genre thrills  an intelligent and extremely well made romantic drama that tells an intriguing story with economy and insight  an impressive mix of entertainment and social comment  spinning a great mystery even as it confronts an ugly world  a fascinating sight to behold  it is frears  sure directorial hand  along with some deft performances  that keeps dirty pretty things from ever edging into the risible  this is a sordid story but ultimately not a depressing one  few movies create such perfect pitch among character  plot and setting  quietly mesmerizing and emotionally satisfying  throughout his career  frears has taken chances  and only on rare occasions has he missed the mark  dirty pretty things is right on target  
314,school_of_rock,standout jack black in nerd becomes cool comedy  school of rock made me laugh harder than any movie i ve seen this year  it s irreverent without crossing the line  and hits a tender note without lapsing into maudlin sentiment  this is a crude  loopy  slightly unhinged motion picture  put together almost as if it was some particularly industrial bootleg rock album  
315,festival_express,it captures a pure moment in time when musical hearts and minds beat as one  when musicians of all stripes came together to work and play hard and leave behind one damn fine looking corpse  the road doc format s nothing new  but it preserves such a brief  precious moment in rock history that it ll have fans captivated  there are sterling concert performances by several bands in peak form  what s most revealing and human about festival express are its candid looks at artists bonding aboard the choo choo  
316,bus_174,padilha does much more than just present a hostage situation  he hunts down people who knew nascimento and reconstructs his tortured life  
317,shattered_glass,lacks the journalistic killer instinct that could have elevated it above the well executed but slightly sanctimonious  made for tv feel 
318,los_angeles_plays_itself,using well chosen clips from roughly 200 films  many of them obscure  andersen makes a powerful and impassioned case for reassessing his beloved city  it s like being squired through town by a wisecracking cabbie with a phd in semiotics  an intellectually rigorous but enjoyable essay on the way the city of angels has become hollywood s favourite location  
319,lost_in_la_mancha,anyone who thinks making movies is easy needs to see this hilariously painful cautionary tale  it s a tribute to gilliam that he never once took off his mike or asked the filmmakers to stop rolling  should be required viewing for all film school students  aspiring filmmakers and studio suits  entertaining documentary about how badly everything went  
320,spring_summer_fall_winterand_spring,although not as gut wrenching or politically pugnacious as some of his previous work  kim s film allows a sense of moral renewal unclouded by sentimentality and without blurring his remarkable cinematic idiom  by turns humorous and tragic  kim s film folds buddhist belief into scenarios that capture the eye while they provoke the mind  
321,city_of_god,i came away from this film impressed by its narrative control but unmoved by anything it had to say  the living conditions it projects are as horrendous as i had feared  but the movie is surprisingly easy to take as a rollicking homicidal entertainment  a dynamic masterpiece in any language  watching the humanity in the city slowly crumble as poverty and degradation slowly take over  i couldn t shake the growing lump in my stomach as it hardened into a dry  cold clump  it s a conspicuously stylish attention getter that heralds the discovery of a major directorial talent  it s like scorsese meets peckinpah and sergio leone  with a samba soundtrack  hard to watch but even harder to tear your eyes away from  meirelles takes us to a real life deathtrap and then proceeds to make us feel twice as alive for the time we spend there  an incredibly assured  compelling and often sardonically funny piece of filmmaking  traffic was brilliant fiction  but city of god proves that true stories often pack the most punch  it should be considered required viewing  i think  by anyone who seeks to understand how violence begets violence  
322,memories_of_murder_2003,bong elevates every scene with his unbelievably assured filmmaking  almost single handedly resuscitates the moribund serial killer genre  uses dark humor  incisive characterizations and social commentary to infuse its familiar detective tale with a distinctive flair  achieves an unlikely but ultimately successful blend of blunt force comedy and desperate investigation  
323,whale_rider,newcomer castle hughes  unaffected  confident turn makes it credible our heroine might retain her determination and self worth despite serial setbacks  caro seems less concerned with evoking the economic or socio political baggage bringing the film s characters down than she is with telling the same sappy tale of patriarchal perseverance we ve seen so many times before  
324,best_of_youth,its themes are for everybody  though this wonderful drama must surely hold a special relevance for the graying boomers who went through those wild years  
325,magdalene_sisters,this drama about a shocking reality from recent history balances a light touch with searing intensity and a sense of moral outrage  grimly believable  a deliberately provocative film that triggers the audience s emotions in order to highlight important issues of personal freedom  amen to that  you may never look at a nun the same way again  a story like this one could easily succumb to outraged melodrama  but not only does mullan keep the drama human sized  he even leavens it with the humor that one can easily believe had to be summoned to endure such misguided and malicious treatment  whatever value the film might have had as an expos  of social sin is undermined by its prejudicial stereotyping of every single nun and priest  instead of a morally serious film about a corrupt institution  it becomes mere agitprop  definitely one sided  but still very powerful  there s been no sex  no unwanted children  just the allure of the possibility of carnal actions and for that she s been sent to work her life away in an inhuman institution  watching the film  you can feel years of real pain  it feels more like gothic documentary than darkly limned fancy  a stirring  emotionally galvanizing film  not only due to its shattering subject matter but thanks to mullan s spot on eye for casting and fluid  uncoercive style  the cast is uniformly fine  particularly smiley eyed geraldine mcewan as the avaricious sister bridget  and the filmmaking haunting  
326,the_man_on_the_train,patrice leconte s fanciful odd couple drama oozes flavorful  provincial atmosphere  no one mixes graceful melancholy and bittersweet comedy better than leconte  
327,alien_the_directors_cut_2007,they really don t make them like this any more  
328,in_america,moving but slightly graphic  mature teens only  lovingly shot  with a remarkable debut from sarah bolger  who along with sister emma  gives one of the greatest ever child performances  the pairing of two brilliant  loose cannon actors gets the film a long way  at its best  the movie has a supernal glow that you can practically warm your hands by  as good as the bolger sisters are  it s the hard edged performances of considine and morton that truly bring urgency to the material  jim sheridan s sentimental heartwarmer of a story about an immigrant irish family in modern new york is frankly manipulative and contrived  these characters are so likable  the young girls so engagingly delightful  that we root for these survivors to succeed and overcome  an achingly intimate and beautifully observed account of the immigrant experience  jim sheridan s in america doesn t just tear at the heart strings  it rips them out  cuts them up  sets the pieces on fire and pours cold water on the ashes  
329,mystic_river,eastwood and his actors create a brooding drama whose events and interrelationships seem surreally improbable yet painfully authentic  violence and revenge have been a staple of eastwood s work from the beginning  but here he explores his subject from a new  more ambiguous angle  with no regard for macho titillation  while not quite the equal of the novel  it s more complex  emotionally charged and better acted than the average hollywood thriller  the unfashionably slow editing style and the concentration on close ups and two shots allow eastwood to scrutinise his characters as they are forced to dig into themselves  too depressing to fill audiences with delight  but it does seem to validate questionable attitudes  especially an indifference to the suffering of innocent people and a willingness to shoot first and ask questions later  solid  rarely showy performances  meticulously recreated detective work and moments of pure unadulterated grief accent this whodunit  a movie that will have those who haven t read the book fooled for much of its length  contains so many layers that you ll want to see it more than once  it s one for the memory books  clint eastwood s latest directorial effort is perhaps the best film he s ever made  a solid whodunit  with disturbing  provocative  take home insights into human nature  
330,28_days_later,twenty eight days later is a zombie flick  which makes it my kind of movie dare i say  our kind of movie  no cinema zombie ever shambles into view without its agenda  the movie s craft makes the dread of a killer virus contagious  viewers may feel they have come down with a case of secondhand sars or sympathetic monkeypox  heedlessly derivative though it may be  28 days later does what it sets out to do and then some    scare us out of our wits  then get us to apply those wits to an uncommonly intelligent and provocative zombie flick  later does a lot of things right  which makes its third act missteps even more frustrating  danny boyle s purposeful direction and mark tildesley s imaginative and resourceful production design keep this fresh and edgy  the images of a wasted london and the details of a paramilitary organization in the countryside are both creepy and persuasive  danny boyle has got his edge back  impeccably acted  scored and edited  boyle s film hits to the jugular like an uppercut from a heavyweight champion leaving me more than a bit cowered by the time of its bittersweet coda  it makes for a more intimate brand of horror  one we can t explain away by pretending we re watching the same old well oiled hollywood malarkey  boyle can t quite come up with anything to match the eerie brilliance of his opening  never mind  it s all you need to see that his career is finally back on track  in its blessed stretches of quietude  28 days later offers a heartfelt rumination on humans  ability to build new families when old ones are lost  i enjoyed watching this film  mostly because murphy and harris make such an appealing central couple to build a new world around  but nobody should mistake this for a killer zombie movie with real soul  detestable  not just because its action is so vile or its technique so crude  but because its moral imagination is so impoverished  director boyle and screenwriter alex garland have rebounded smartly from the bloated leonardo dicaprio debacle that was the beach  their previous collaboration  
331,baadasssss,seethes with well targeted humor that mixes comfortably with its simmering energy and anger  never feels like anything more than kids playing dress up  
332,far_from_heaven,when a movie gets it all impeccably  heartbreakingly right  as does todd haynes  stunning far from heaven  some critics are tempted to gush deepest purple   i ll try to stay anchored to more sensible levels of bliss  with a classic storytelling style bordering on corniness  a deft tragicomic touch and a heroic refusal to use the safety net of irony  haynes has managed to produce something of a gem  julianne moore and dennis quaid are outstanding as cathy and frank whitaker  a perfect couple with a decidedly imperfect love life  we are left wondering why  in any case  an imitation sirk was needed  what appetite or interest it might fill  even with its latter day  modified  frankness  far from heaven is only thin glamour that lacks a tacit wry base  with tact and care  the movie digs into all the subjects that lay concealed below the surface when max ophuls and douglas sirk were filming their own melodramas in the nineteen fifties  quaid makes a decent man s anguish richly palpable  moore makes us feel hidden frenzy with a cool and ultimately heartbreaking grace  todd haynes has crafted a feature length homage to sirk that succeeds both on its own terms and as the sirk film that could never have been made in his own lifetime  an accomplished marriage of elaborate style and content  haynes is interested in exploring deeper issues than a little country club gossip  and he makes sure that the pretty pictures don t lead us to forget that  this is a film made as if it was created and put together in the 1950 s  and that aesthetic eschews the rapid fire patterns and short attention span platitudes of many modern films  far from heaven may not be the most spontaneous film you ll see this year  but in its own dippy way  it s bound to be one of the most heartfelt  it s worth seeing for quaid s multileveled  perfectly modulated  frankly amazing performance  
333,saraband,with saraband  the great writer director has stepped back into the ring for one last epic wrestle with his demons  there is  as always  no easy outcome  but no one ever fought for higher emotional and spiritual stakes  a parlour room theatre of emotional cruelty  with all exits barred by the past  while bringing an abundance of inspiration to this world  bergman unapologetically refused to ignore the pain and darkness that infects mankind  there will never be another filmmaker like him  for those inclined to search for psychological twists  the film offers plenty of freudian situations capable of provoking lengthy discussions  for the film buff  the discussions will turn to a bergman still at the peak of his craft  a stunning and complex final bow from a stunning and complex artist  what remain intact are the filmmaker s unbreakable heart  lyrical soul and sublime art  so why should we say goodbye  instead  bravo  encore  saraband  flat and static both visually and thematically  doesn t begin to approximate the austere beauty of the director s art house classics  saraband shows absolutely no sign that bergman has run out of things to say or ways to say them    it is as fresh and direct as any he s made  powerfully  painfully honest  bergman may find little with which to console himself  but he s still able to look at suffering with an intensity that s unlike any other the movies have ever known  ullmann  in her mid 60s  and josephson  in his early 80s  still know how to build fascinating characters  an emotionally searing look at the ways we hurt the ones we love and the ones we have come to hate  performed in a series of devastating duets  it s so mature and authentic that it feels like an alien presence in the current  i e  shallow  movie landscape  
334,stevie,stevie is a tough movie to watch and an even tougher one to leave  because once you re involved you re implicated  a haunting documentary  personal essay that provokes violently mixed feelings toward both subject and filmmaker  bring kleenex  despite good reviews at this year s sundance film festival  this is the kind of squishy lost cause that gives liberal guilt a bad name  if james and his crew can spend years with these blighted souls  surely you can spend two hours with them  exploring compassion s outer limits  overly long and uncomfortably intrusive  but never less than compelling  
335,tokyo_godfathers,a modern anim  classic fit for rediscovery by both adults and kids not to mention a stirring celebration of inclusivity that remains ahead of its time  no amount of shoehorned in razzle dazzle can keep this forced fable from feeling like a shadow of kon s early work  japanese animator satoshi kon has a striking sense of composition  but i m more impressed by his storytelling skills  a delightfully rambunctious holiday fable about the vital importance of family  gritty yet surprisingly touching story  i found myself alternately puzzled and transported by this unusual helping of anime  social indifference and injustice plague the protagonists  as well as our own consciences  this may very well be the point of the whole exercise  tokyo godfathers is the kind of old fashioned  all ages entertainment hollywood used to churn out in live action form before the era of niche marketing  when a good story sold a film  interesting stuff that s plain fun to watch  full of charm  grittiness and a solid storyline  the movie deserves an audience far beyond diehard animation fans  an ambitious and impressively inventive undertaking  
336,im_not_scared,salvatores  classically illustrative treatment should open arthouse doors for the visually sumptuous production  
337,x2_xmen_united,performances are solid throughout  with the actors managing to straight face their way through some truly inane dialogue  
338,freaky_friday,mother daughter switch is fun comedic chaos  
339,kill_bill_vol_1,visually striking  but also very violent  a strange  fun and densely textured work that gets better as it goes along  even more gory and adolescent than its models  which explains both the fun and the unpleasantness of this globe trotting romp  it s all bang  bang  no kiss  kiss  but this is still bravura film making from a prodigious talent  and thurman may yet prove its saving grace  there is no ironic overlay in tarantino s movies  no  commenting  on the pop schlock he s replicating  he simply wants to remake in his own way the kinds of movies he s always loved  and he s about as uncynical as a movie geek can be  brutally bloody and thrillingly callous from first to last  i would argue that  in a bizarre way  mr  tarantino empowers women as no action genre director before him ever has  it all adds up to an epic pop artefact of indescribable soullessness  kill bill is one long yakkety yak about tarantino s passions  he s the samurai who won t shut up  delivered with such high panache and brio  it s mesmerizing  whatever bill s limitations  style isn t one of them  not only is this the work of a major and vital talent in full bloom  it s the most thrillingly entertaining american movie so far this year  
340,mighty_wind,hilarious folk music mockumentary has some innuendo  you don t leave a mighty wind laughing so much as humming  its dialogue may be improvised  but its music is well rehearsed  while guest never forgets to laugh  he never forgets to love either  embracing the very subject he is simultaneously throttling  there is plenty of top flight comedy in this brisk picture   t he most heartwarming spoof ever made  a worthy entry into guest s growing gallery of movies that prove far more interesting than the worlds at which they re so brilliantly poking fun  a fine grained picture that goes for the sideways laughs rather than the straight ahead ones  
341,master_and_commander_the_far_side_of_the_world,thanks in no small measure to perfect storm designer william sandell  this handsomely mounted actioner exudes the authentic tang of salt  sweat and gunpowder  a quite sturdy and enjoyably romp through the ferocious pacific high seas  russell crowe wages war on water in this rousing  old fashioned adventure  which stays afloat despite being almost as long and self important as its title  to put it plainly  two ships playing tag across the seas is no longer my idea of whoopee  especially at a time when grown ups are popping up all over the screen with uncensored stories of the eternal affinities and all their variations  should have the late o brian beaming in his grave  the film contains brilliantly crafted scenes and shots that are as compelling as anything seen onscreen this year  but there are also dull stretches in which the movie seems lightweight    never in its execution but in its conception  it s an adventure movie by an artist  even if you can t tell a mizzenmast from a gangplank  master and commander will take your breath away  
342,1118347-quiet_american,adapts a graham greene novel with something approaching economy but far removed from finesse  raser has finally made good on his hesitant dramatic turn in gods and monsters a few years back  
343,elf,a movie made by people who really have their thinking caps on  
344,caterina_in_the_big_city,it s an adolescent to adult drama that never veers into maudlin or sugary territory  there s a realness on screen that translates to any culture  pitch perfect performances and a light handed but razor sharp script keep this satire brisk and biting  
345,zatoichi_2003,this film is a shebang  a full scale show  complete with everything you would happily pay to see  costumes  tattoos  scratchy folk music  gambling in saki dens  you will eat it up  the blind swordsman  zatoichi begins life as a straight up samurai movie  evolves into a slapstick comedy and ends as a rousing  tap dancing musical  zatoichi is a mix and match crowd pleaser that shouldn t add up  but delightfully does  however improbably  kitano pulls it off quite gloriously  admittedly  this isn t one of his most idiosyncratic  innovative or  indeed  satisfying works  but it s without doubt fast  funny  fabulous to behold  for those unfamiliar with such films  zatoichi might be a little off putting  but given a chance  the movie can be pretty entertaining  this is a wonderfully odd movie  proof that an artist can leave his personal stamp on any film  no matter the genre  beneath its layers of epic detail  this zatichi is cinematic cotton candy  an immensely entertaining and at times moving story  a breathtakingly choreographed dance of revenge and justice  while kitano  the performer fights with his seemingly endless array of enemies  kitano the filmmaker makes sure that everything is beautiful  from the wonderful colors and passing tableaux to the intricate fighting choreography  aimed squarely at a samurai literate audience  and its appeal beyond that is probably limited  there aren t that many action films that end in musical numbers and this film makes you wonder why  nutty stuff  it s the kind of film i more and more find myself seeking out  a film that seems alive in the sense that it appears to have free will  
346,in_this_world,more successful as an eye opening procedural than a fully satisfying narrative  
347,five_obstructions,a special auteurist treat that s easier to enjoy than to describe or categorize  
348,bend_it_like_beckham,superb tale of a girl s struggle for her dreams  fine character work by juliet stevenson  archie panjabi  and bollywood regular anupam kher makes this well worth seeing  more rooted in small screen sitcom than anything deeper  delightfully upbeat  it will send you back out onto the street grinning from ear to ear  nagra and knightley have winning personalities  but credit should also go to writer director chadha for getting the balance right between humour and pathos  and sporting and romantic action  every generation has to discover the same clichs that were drummed into previous generations  and kids could do worse than to learn them from this film  as spencer tracy once said of katharine hepburn  there s not much meat there  but what s there is choice  this sports dramatic comedy about culture  gender  parents and growing up just might prove to be one of the year s best and it easily rekindles my waning enthusiasm about making trips to the multiplex  beckham is so earnestly yearning it packs an emotional impact far greater than the sum of its parts  the movie isn t unwatchable  it s clumsily good natured  the actors are appealing  and there are worse ways to spend two hours than looking at pretty young girls in shorts kicking balls  its sleek  easygoing  utterly un remarkable charm has precious little to recommend it outside of the standard coming of age or date night movie  that rare breed of crowd pleaser  one in which it doesn t matter that you immediately know how it s all going to end  because getting there is so much fun  
349,the_son_2003,a substantial story about how one man handles his personal turmoil  i can t deny being stirred by the wildly melodramatic climax of the son  with its thunderously quiescent zen buddhist conclusion  
350,intimate_strangers_2003,a mysterious love story takes chances and mostly succeeds  what s at stake in intimate strangers is something quite small  the relationship between two lonely people  we care because leconte helps us to understand their isolation  and we end up sharing their thirst for human contact  the most captivating thing about this taut  talkative film is how comic actor fabrini plays against the commanding bonnaire  this modest french language film follows the time honored cinematic tradition of plot as spearheaded by a simple twist of fate  
351,funny-ha-ha,this is an undoubtedly modest yet wholly pleasurable tale about the difficulties that come with letting go of youth  each stammer  hesitation and nervous laugh reminds us of who we once were  still are or even hope to be  
352,pieces_of_april,thanksgiving just wouldn t be thanksgiving without a dysfunctional family reunion  but writer director peter hedges comes up with an original take on the holiday disaster theme in the quiet gem pieces of april  it s interesting to see holmes in something like this  which gives an edge to her usual cute and cloying persona  laughter and poignancy go hand in hand in this dv debut whose comedy that may be standard  but never ceases to deliver sharp  dark laughs  a shining example of just how compelling and affecting low budget filmmaking can be when you ve got a good story and strong cast  a collection of indie clichs  it s about as refreshing as being slapped in the face by a five week old kipper  longer on calculating sourness than on psychologically organic wit  it s in the cross cutting between april s disaster prone preparations and her family s turbulent journey that hedges s movie finds its lively and likeable rhythm  this is one of those quietly wonderful films that really deserves an audience  the film more than earns its heartwarming finale by virtue of the skilled performances of the leads  deftly captures the pressures that accompany holiday gatherings  a movie that goes a long way toward proving that we all really can get along and that it s possible for a director to put a lump in our throats without making us feel like saps  
353,the_cuckoo_2003,writer director alexander rogozhkin has a way of lapsing into cuteness when the story calls for something more challenging  but the cuckoo eventually finds its own kind of light  ridiculous tone that generally doesn t talk down to the characters  a mystical fairy tale by alexander rogozhkin as beautiful as it is tender  a winning piece of folk art from an isolated way of life  worth a look for those who want to see the world in all its quirky and earthy forms  this is an engrossing film with an oddly satisfying ending of genuine pathos  rogozhkin s unusual film has the audacity to consider those which uplift the human spirit  as well as those that erode it  it s an unabashed pacifist movie that really works  emotionally and dramatically  rogozhin s finely observed character studies and his cast s capable acting     make the cuckoo a thoughtful film more about love than war  a beautifully shot  modest little fable about the misunderstandings between people  a stirring action movie    in the international manner of the fast runner or no man s land rather than t3  
354,dracula_pages_from_a_virgins_diary,though it sounds like an offbeat idea even for horror fans  the tech work is so well done that it could disarm unwary buffs attracted by the campy title  by the end  you ll wonder why all films aren t made this way  attractive art house picture  it will no doubt leave ballet fans somewhat nonplussed  but this evocative danse macabre is an unusually insightful addition to the count s long list of cinematic appearances  a diversion that only makes you wish you could have seen royal winnipeg s original ballet  it s far and away the most original symphony of terror since f w  murnau raised hackles and schrecks with his 1922 nosferatu  maddin turns an old  dusty classic into something grippingly new  maddin takes cinema to its outer limits without stranding you there in a vacuum of heady esoterica  a 75 minute tour de force that s often fascinating  sometimes frustrating  but ultimately rewarding  one of the most bizarre and extraordinary dance movies you ll ever see  
355,noi-the-albino,the laconic lemarquis does a solid job carrying off k ri s dryly mordant wit  making this eccentric story well worth watching  
356,matchstick_men,this is a movie about con games at every level  matchstick men never really casts off its cloak of artificiality and calculation  its pleasures are minor  however distracting they may be  scott tucks away his visual athletics in favour of something leisurely and quietly devastating  it s ultimately far more cunning a script than we can reveal here  ridley scott lets us enjoy the satisfying clicks and whirrs of the well oiled celluloid con trick  while leaving plenty of head room for cage to twitch and fret in  on the heels of other fun loving caper films like ocean s 11  the exceedingly stylish matchstick men briefly threatens to fall into that entertaining but empty retro conceit of palm trees and wide lapels  crisis averted  matchstick men is really two movies brilliantly spliced into one  each enriching the other  matchstick men isn t even remotely intricate  it s not even particularly interesting  more than just tics and hurried mannerisms  cage s roy is a percolating time bomb of emotional baggage  the actor delving deep inside the tortured grifter s inner demons  uneven but oddly likeable  a whimsical winner in which everybody seems to be having a blast  
357,secret_lives_of_dentists,domestic scenes with the kids are drawn with letter perfect naturalism

359,monsieur_ibrahim,that rare film about the sort of emotionally needy people who don t wear their neediness on their sleeves  this cinematic plea for tolerance makes for more than tolerable viewing  thanks to omar sharif s title turn as the shop owner with a yen for aphorisms  good intentions meet maladroit writing in francois dupreyon s tacky coming of age drama  which skillfully imagines the bustle of 1960s paris but neglects to insert any plausible characters therein  
360,tibet_cry_of_the_snow_lion,each revelation seems more disturbing than the next  focuses too much on what we know and not enough on what we don t  if richard gere annoys you  ignore him and the other celebrities mentioned here and learn something  
361,yossi_and_jagger,an unusually subtle and convincing study of group psychology and fluctuating morale among professionals under stress in close quarters  
362,a_tale_of_two_sisters,this is a carefully structured film about grief and guilt  as well as horror  they don t resolve every disturbing moment or confusing element  they leave some questions hauntingly unanswered  the film feels haunted by the relationship between im and moon  who cling to each other in the face of a hostile hostess  even though that may not be their best option  there s more rank dread and inscrutable mystery in any one scene of this south korean psychological thriller than in all the american horror films of the past 10 years  there s a reason why hollywood has been so busy in recent years remaking asian horror movies  scare for scare  they re generally better  the gorgeous slow moving cinematography by lee mogae is remarkable  ji woon kim may be the korean david lynch and his juxtaposition of seemingly innocent and suddenly searing situations is marvelously unnerving  as are the constantly shifting personalities of most of his characters  there s no denying the eye for hypnotic imagery employed by writer director ji woon kim and cinematographer mo gae lee  we aren t meant to understand the story fully until the film s closing minutes  so the shocks and suggestions come in a muddled context  precise direction that goes more for slow chills than quick frights  and a script with some startling twists  makes a tale of two sisters a classy entry in the east asian psycho horror stakes  murky and pretty near incomprehensible  a tour de force of psychological horror at its creepiest  although a tale of two sisters has some excellent suspense sequences  it falters badly during the dramatic parts  plays like a gorgeous painting hanging in a gloomy gallery    you stand in front of one corner  mesmerized by turquoise wallpaper or a burgundy rug  then a fleeting movement in another corner draws you over  
363,ten,a very interesting film  despite structural limitations that keep it from approaching greatness  a rare chance for viewers to eavesdrop on everyday talk in tehran that  although fictionalized  must approximate what really happens in iran s busy capital  ten may strain your patience but that s the high stakes gamble of this provocative project  a conceptual tour de force and a brainiac s road movie  abbas kiarostami s ten goes from chilly abstraction to hot emotion in less than 60 seconds  very soon it s clear that even from a camera trained on the front seat of a car  an amazingly full and complex portrait of iranian life can emerge  ten has been praised as a further distillation of kiarostami s already minimalist cinema  that s true enough  even if his movies still have a tendency to make us carsick  kiarostami is nothing if not patient  almost to a fault here  he allows life to happen as the film rolls  and one can t help but wonder if  to cover a lot of emotional ground  you must also cover a lot of asphalt  makes maximum use of a minimalist structure to deliver some cogent observations about the status of women in contemporary iran  ten might not be the easiest film for hollywood conditioned viewers to get into or to enjoy  but it never seems like an arid experiment  a glimpse into a society that has grown more open  more free  and also more casually selfish in its interpersonal aggression  conceptually rigorous  splendidly economical  and radically bazinian  one of the most casually progressive of the recent iranian films  presenting its predominantly female cast as candid  freethinking and completely sympathetic

365,lilja_4_ever,i read of thousands of women from eastern europe who are lured into virtual slavery  i hope some of their clients will attend this movie  even if for the wrong reasons  and see what they are responsible for  it says nothing more useful than  isn t this shocking  aren t we powerless to do anything about it  this sober  unsparing drama  strong if unambitious  is probably as perfectly characteristic a specimen of serious european filmmaking as any movie ever made  
366,thirteen,it is here that the performances pay emotional dividends  the sight of hunter kissing her daughter s self inflicted scars as if trying to kiss away the psychological pain that raised them will haunt me for some time  explicit peer pressure story for older teens  stands as an agonizing look at the giddy energies and terrible pains of characters whose lives have grown beyond their resources to cope  gritty indie after school special

369,chaos2001,there s a core of anger running throughout chaos  particularly in the steely performances by its two female leads  that gives this satisfying feminist revenge drama satire its soul  the picture holds us  not only through our wonderment at the mixture but through serreau s dexterity and her casting  the men  filled with brutality and neglect  make for rather obvious targets  yet we come to care about the women in their lives beyond any agenda chaos might have  an effective french concoction that starts off like a thriller but keeps revealing different sides  even if chaos is hampered by a desire to be all things to all people  serreau s nimble touch bestows this schizophrenic genre pastiche with an infectiously zany verve  
370,bukowski_born_into_this,dullaghan uncovers the human being behind the myth  thanks again to old footage  an amazing  worthy journey  provides an overview of bukowski s work and allows us to gaze into the soul of a man who built a fortress of toughness around his vulnerable core  over a period of seven years  dullaghan interviewed hundreds of people who knew or were affected by bukowski  the result is both wide ranging and intimate  how much was legend  how much was pose  how much was real  i think it was all real  and the documentary suggests as much  a portrait of a sometimes surly  often foulmouthed  always brilliant artist that is at once humane  horrific  hilarious and deeply moving  it reveals bukowski to be a far grander artist than his bum s armor would suggest  as a thorough examination of what made this boozing  brawling womanizer tick  born into this can t be beat  without straining  this definitive  deeply engrossing film biography makes a strong case for charles bukowski as a major american poet  speaks for the idolaters without apology  yet it maintains just enough level headedness to show the darker  not so admirable aspects of the bukowski legend  its power springs from the director s shifting between fawning stories from long time acquaintances and the scraggly  take it or leave it surliness of bukowski himself  you come out of the theater wanting to beeline to a bookstore  grab a copy of post office or love is a dog from hell  and adjust your opinion as necessary  accomplishes beautifully what it sets out to do  which is to reveal the man behind the crusty  hard drinking  tough talking persona charles bukowski so artfully crafted  
371,barbarian_invasions,it is a beauty  it blitzes all the phoniness  pretentiousness and political correctness around today  savages icons of popular and national culture  gives the finger to religious untouchables like mother theresa  and brought the house down  arcand s own script is delightfully fluid  his direction poised  despite an uneven cast  arcand finds a tonal balance between sentimental and cynical that keeps the conversations real and heart wrenching  so many fascinating ideas are raised here that arcand s decision to explore them within the context of a self satisfied soap is disappointing  both the comedy and the weepy moments tend towards the trite  but the film is directed and performed with such brio and manipulative skill that one eventually succumbs to its somewhat dubious charms  a nicely balanced blend of sentiment and acrid wit  the movie is brutally funny and ironic about the way this corrupt world is manipulated by the cynical sbastien  ultimately a gracious  even sweet natured film  optimistic almost despite itself  if you haven t seen the original  which  if memory serves  was billed as  the big chill with a doctorate   no worries  arcand s follow up stands alone as a universal story of generational reconciliation  admirable in its refusal to be politically correct  although i had a mixed reaction to the movie  i recommend it for its willingness to acknowledge mortality and for arcand s grace as a filmmaker  
372,bad_santa,an uproarious all out assault on propriety  
373,open_range,a flawed but highly entertaining b western blown up to john ford scale  the casting of this film may be its greatest asset  duvall and costner have the easy familiarity of longtime partners  a movie that seeks no higher calling than to entertain us the way hollywood used to  not without its charms  what he does find  however  makes for some of the richest and most satisfyingly character driven dramatics of the year  making the schizophrenic awfulness of the some of the rest that much more difficult to understand  has a pace as laconic as its director s screen persona  an awesome compendium of cowboy movie cliches  it borders on parody  and often crosses the border  rustling up a drove of oater aphorisms  open range is too talky  too corny and too long  yet it gets so much right  from its simple affection for the sight of horses at full gallop to a climactic gunfight that sets a new standard for wit and excitement and right  eous revenge  
374,stone_reader,it s an intimate look at the gears inside one person s head and a study of how an obsession  when handled judiciously  can be enlightening  fascinating and compulsively watchable  moskowitz may soon find himself in the same boat as many of the artists he is analyzing  because stone reader is going to be one tough act to follow  enormously affectionate  gloriously self indulgent and unhesitatingly heroic in its championing of good books  occasionally overwrought and overwritten  it should delight anyone who loves to curl up with a book  or loves to tell someone about a book worth curling up with  the stultifying pace and moskowitz s filmmaking laziness are forgivable  but it s exasperating and indicative of our low expectations for the documentary form that a film that taps the likes of leslie fiedler could be so devoid of ideas  to anyone whose soul lives or dies by reading or writing or both  the movie is a total thrill  both an involving real life mystery and a passionate romance between a novelist and his ideal reader  moskowitz indulgences himself too often at the expense of audience patience  filmmaker mark moskowitz  who earns a living making political commercials  turns his considerable skills of media persuasion to the nobler service of selling serious books  and with stone reader  he makes the sale  an unalloyed treasure for any viewer who has ever felt transformed by reading a good novel  what stone reader offers that s new is its portrayal of reading not as a supremely civilized and soulful activity but as a lonely  thwarting and sometimes painfully embarrassing one  
375,amandla_a_revolution_in_four_part_harmony,filmed performances  archive footage  and some evocative reminiscences from legendary singers and actors such as miriam makeba  vusi mahlasela and sibongile khumalo bring the period back to life  this is powerful stuff  presented unblinkingly and yet with rousing ardour  like going to the lecture of an impassioned but really disorganized professor  you exit class flipping through your notes and have no idea what most of them mean  music was the anc s most dangerous weapon  and we see footage of streets lined with tens of thousands of marchers  singing and dancing  expressing an unquenchable spirit  it leaves you stirred and uplifted not only by its music but also by the determination and courage of the people who sang and danced it on the way to a freer life  a great documentary that makes your heart leap with joy  johanna demetrakas  editing is magnificent at orchestrating and balancing potentially conflicting moods to build a consistent tone all the movie s own  talking heads outnumber performing heads by a roughly 3 to 1 ratio  
376,confessions_of_a_dangerous_mind,though the real life barris has yet to confirm or deny his double life as detailed in his autobiography of the same name  confessions of a dangerous mind is an fascinating tale about an even more fascinating guy  brimming with slightly self conscious directorial panache  the movie zips between nearly three decades  fantasy and reality without ever really deciding how seriously it wants to take itself  bounces around like the smarter and weirder older brother of spielberg s catch me if you can  there isn t an emotional connection to the people or actions taking place on screen  and while i was impressed with some of the performances and filmmaking the film as a whole left me cold  confessions of a dangerous mind may not be in the citizen kane class  but george clooney s first foray behind the camera does boast similarly bravura technique and an infectious sense of joy in the filmmaking process  clooney zips through a very funny first act  before becoming a little bogged down as the action enters john le carr territory  confessions is without a doubt a memorable directorial debut from king hunk  a darkly enjoyable roller coaster ride  this somber  draggy movie  which is nothing like the breezy  lunatic comedy its tv ads promise  takes barris  claims at face value and plays them for stone faced drama  who would ve thought a movie about chuck barris could be so rich and entertaining  a blast from beginning to end and shows first time director george clooney is equal parts fearless  brilliant and perhaps daft  but an intriguing daftness it is  rockwell lets us see all the joy  lust  self pity  and rage with which barris gonged himself  
377,chihwaseon,this south korean film is one of the few authentic artist biopics ever created for the screen  it doesn t crudely guess at the source of the late 19th century painter jang seung up s genius  it simply exhibits it  it is quietly observant  with a detached eye for the telling moment  and the visual compositions are often exquisite  the problem is  painting isn t a spectator sport  as the interminable scenes of jang at work continually confirm   chihwaseon  rushes through the life of its subject in nimble leaps and bounds  concentrating on the livelier and more spectacular parts and avoiding the dull historical and biographical stretches  another masterpiece from one of the world s more neglected great directors  a master artist who here reveals the soul of another  a fascinating  consummately crafted and ultimately moving study of a man who conforms surprisingly closely to western archetypes of the artist as rebel and hedonist  the movie s attention to anthropological and historical detail means things are slow to come alive  but once they do  the nature of jang s psychic torture is palpable and unmistakable  a vividly entertaining portrait  the film s sexy romanticism and its tragic sense of korean history will thrill even those who have never set foot in an art gallery  painted fire is gorgeous  even a shot of the dirty and miserable jang flinging himself about in a bare room of wadded up paintings turns into a thing of beauty  a handsome film  filled with lavish costumes and set designs and told in a series of exquisitely composed images  there s much to fill the eyes  if you ve never seen a south korean film  or even if you have  chihwaseon is an ideal place to start or continue  mr  im s own aesthetic command is evident in the movie s wealth of beautiful  perfectly framed images of nature  im kwon taek recounts the life of a 19th century korean painter with the workmanlike precision one expects from someone who s directed nearly 100 features in 40 years  im kwon taek has crafted a stirring  poetic portrait of the creative process as personified by ohwon  an eminent late 19th century korean painter  
378,seabiscuit,what should lift your spirit only threatens to eject your lunch  
379,25th_hour,lee and his cast are so adept at getting us acquainted with monty and these other people that we wind up feeling like we ve known them for years  pretty lethargic stuff  
380,step_into_liquid,an awe inspiring survey of global surf culture  absolutely unlike any documentary you ve ever seen  step into liquid nearly qualifies as a religious experience  in any sport  whether it s whacking a ball into a cup or your opponent into submission  the majestic and the absurd are very close cousins  and brown is generous enough here to give us a long look at both  step into liquid delivers eye popping shots pumped up by the genuine cowabunga enthusiasm of true believers  by the end all you want to do is get in the water  step into liquid is for extreme sports fans  for sure  but its appeal is wide enough to leave this mild mannered movie critic itching to catch a wave someday  while step into liquid has charming and even breathtaking moments  it definitely flags after the halfway point  brown s premise is that surfing is fun anywhere  and his film celebrates that idea and showcases the spectacular moves and wrecks that are an integral part of any surf movie  serves up enough action and passion to stay afloat  but at the end of the day it s just not the perfect ride those earlier films were  because it gets so close to the real thing  the film does a good job of letting even the most hopelessly landlocked viewers experience vicariously the unique allure and adrenaline rush of being one with a surging 60 foot wall of water  this is pretty much a feel good film for committed fans and moviegoers looking for some spectacular combination of travelogue  athleticism and slo mo grace  with neo rock replacing beach boyisms and new optical technology permitting crisp steadicam close ups of ballet like aquabatics  step into liquid is state of the art non art  brown goes off in search of those who surf only because they love it  and this takes him to some unexpected places  
381,ghosts_of_the_abyss,if you see only one james cameron directed movie about thetitanic  and you should   see the one that doesn t star kate and leo  this hour long feature  edited down from 900 hours of footage  is both a technical marvel and a heartfelt memorial to those who died when the ship sank in 1912  despite paxton s whooping every time a new artefact comes on screen  it s hard to be constantly excited about watching a bunch of rusty  decayed junk    historic and three dimensional though it may be  one of the rare imax movies in which the 3 d effects are completely melded into the picture  rather than simply used as a gimmick  do we really need to see cameron and his team of scientists blown up to such nauseating proportions  might as well be titled  james cameron  what i did on my holidays  ghosts of the abyss is an incredible experience that will further enhance our century long fascination with the titanic  an educational outing  shedding light on a deep  dark place most of us have only imagined  a lot like a theme park ride  occasionally exciting but carefully controlled  the remarkable 3 d photography  which adds amazing depth and detail to the projected image  makes even the pointless passages absorbing  
382,divine_intervention_2003,the visual puns  sight gags and the little parables told by the few speaking characters are rarely laugh out loud funny  but they provoke thought  debate and diverse interpretations  suleiman s argument seems to be that the situation between palestinians and israelis has settled into an hopeless stalemate  in which everyday life incorporates elements of paranoia  resentment and craziness  a film whose eerie blend of deadpan wit and inner angst upset all your expectations  a collection of repetitive  seemingly unrelated vignettes  as symbolic as they are self consciously waggish  no matter what your political sensibilities  you can t deny this movie s striking originality  veers uneasily and unsatisfyingly from kitschy  agitprop surrealism to a laconic spareness that is less profound than tedious  unfortunately the gags here vary enormously in their effectiveness  a movie of long  expressive silences  divine intervention articulates things that have never been articulated  at least on the screen  
383,blue_car,worth watching for the coming out party of agnes bruckner  a relative newcomer who shows her mettle with an extraordinary performance in this very ordinary tear jerker  an impressive first effort from ms  moncrieff  but the eternal aristotelian in me finds it depressing to watch characters always walking around in moral quicksand  it s an incredibly strong debut reinforced by astonishingly good performances by all the principals  a well intentioned coming of age film anchored by two indelible performances but weakened by an overabundance of drama  we ve seen this unhappy scenario played out many times before  but seldom with a better eye for detail  the story is so well acted and honestly written that after a while it stops bothering us that we know where it s going  as bitterness piles upon disappointment piles upon loneliness  blue car stalls under the weight of its emotional baggage  i didn t like blue car  and the only thing i found appalling is how blatantly predicable and pseudo daring the supposedly appalling stuff is  a coming of age tale acted with such honesty  and directed with such quiet understanding of its troubled characters  that its nearly unrelenting grimness takes on a poetic quality  from the rain streaked windshield to the unaffected line readings from a stellar cast  there is not a shot in blue car that doesn t ring true  a beautifully crafted and painfully sincere movie that makes most dramas about teenagers seem about as real and relevant as american pie  
384,cooler,a pointless  money depleting waste of time to be avoided at all costs  macy wears his habitual hangdog expression like a cheap  crumpled suit that s been slept in a few too many times in reconstructing macy s equal opportunity loser persona as a romantic winner  the cooler forgets what made its star so winning in the first place  kramer has gotten strong performances from his cast  baldwin is particularly good as the strangely likable  but still horrible  casino owner   had the cooler stuck to its dark guns and not turned into a treacly  love conquers all fairy tale  this movie might have gone somewhere  while it does occasionally shortchange its characters  it provides plenty of moments for the actors to shine  
385,holes,brims with storytelling flourishes and gently deployed life lessons that even accompanying adults may dig  older kids  fans of the book and parents who remember the fun of reading dark stories under the covers should be happily engrossed in this adventure  as kids  films go  it s a thoughtful  superior piece of work  an entertaining picture that youngsters can enjoy on first viewing and perhaps fully grow into as they get a bit older   sachar s  sprawling  shaggy dog story snaps together as neatly on film as in print  but its artificial design is glaringly exposed  fills a hole in the genre by not treating kids with kid gloves  
386,stoked_the_rise_and_fall_of_gator,it s fascinating to see the process by which skateboarding  in all its concrete grittiness  was transformed into a mainstream activity of consumer cool  an exhilarating and terrifying journey through youth culture hell  the movie fails to pull off all its trick moves  you can see why stickler was drawn to the charismatic gator  but his story is so extreme  he is serving life for murder  that it effectively unbalances the project  offers a fascinating look into the skater s tumble from grace  as well as chronicling the renaissance of his rebel sport  even when sketched in broad terms  rogowski s downward spiral makes for compelling viewing  and to her credit  director stickler never romanticizes her subject  by focusing on the self immolation of the thoroughly despicable skateboarding star mark  gator  rogowski  stoked makes us all question the eternal chase for popularity and acceptance that takes up so much of daily life  the calculus of a craze s honest genesis  heady peak  exploitation  and burnout is so familiar by now as to be numbing  but stoked makes it fresh because it has the primary sources at hand  archival footage and interviews with contemporaries round out the rest of the film  illustrating gator s life without really illuminating it  excels as both a tragedy and a celebration of skateboarding  showing how mass marketing legitimized the sport while fueling gator s demise  a story that is unexpectedly poignant even though it s told to an insistent punk rock beat  works effectively as a comprehensive biopic and as a cautionary tale  with wider applications  about the dangers of going too far too fast  
387,bubba_ho_tep,writer director don coscarelli piles on unpleasant details and cynical asides as if they were the stuff of wisdom  though they seem intended to produce guffaws rather than thoughts often hilarious low budget romp  
388,charlotte_sometimes,as an antidote to talky american indies involving twentysomething romantic conundrums  charlotte sometimes hits just the right note  
389,1127787-big_fish,big fish really belongs to albert finney  who proves that when it comes to large performances there is no one who can quite match a british shakespearean with good camera sense  somewhat like forrest gump on a high colonic  
390,mondays_in_the_sun,the best thing that can be said about this funny  poignant and compassionate film is that watching it is not work  bardem gives what might have been too slow and plodding a movie its heart and its humor  shot in lustrous  muted color with a sure sensitivity to emotional states and mood swings  it s an elegy on wasted time and waning energies  though buoyed by excellent  unflinching performances  this melancholy drama reflects the dismally monotonous lives of its subjects just a little too well  
391,intolerable_cruelty,the coens do an efficient job of stamping their signature grotesquerie on sumptuous beverly hills and las vegas settings and ladling on gallows humor and malice  sometimes with the verve of early robert zemeckis  stands up fine as friday night fun and if the aim were to produce a slice of escapist entertainment then it can be said to succeed  if not excel  this time  having found in sturges a sensibility which chimes with their own  they ve got a winner  while it s not nearly as beguiling as the coen s last pic  the uncanny the man who wasn t there  cruelty is still a brisk hoot  this dim witted  mean spirited and brain dead calamity should surprise no one   t here s a lot of problems with the script  and some of the stuff with edward herrmann i don t think works at all  it s not funny it just kind of falls flat  but clooney and catherine zeta jones  i think they deliver enough to say it s worth seeing  no different from most of the other dumb slapstick spoofs that pass for screwball comedy these days  how it plays with audiences  your guess is as good as mine  but if this is what happens when joel and ethan coen sell out  here s one vote for them to do it more often  george clooney and catherine zeta jones square off deliciously  but this  30s style battle of the sexes from the coen brothers never catches fire  in its nasty  blackhearted take on contemporary coupling and uncoupling  intolerable cruelty has the distant though unmistakable ring of truth  
392,good_thief,while jordan s repeated freeze frames try a little too hard for nonchalance  the overall cocktail of gallic insouciance and american film noir grit delivers such relaxant properties you forgive a few foibles  great fun despite its deficiency as a presumed thriller  jordan delivers easily his most satisfying work since 1992 s the crying game  
393,1128577-peter_pan,there s really no way this film should have received a kid friendly pg rating  
394,i_capture_the_castle,with eloquent dialogue but scant smoldering passions  the mushy machinations nicely nudge director tim fywell s gentle little film  not that the whole thing isn t perfectly charming on certain levels  both garai and byrne are quite nice as the two impassioned sisters  never shies from indulging us and our desire for a gentle and generous world that doesn t slip into easy answers  
395,owning_mahowny,a motion picture that never ceases to be worthwhile  works so well both as social satire and outlaw character study  because the movie is a portrait of such a buttoned down personality  viewers may find themselves anxious for more action than the movie provides  the film doesn t really offer much behind its story  hoffman plays it so close to his chest we can t help but be amused by a hubris that resembles self hypnosis  collapses into a public service announcement on gambling  effectively shows the way gambling can narrow the lens through which gamblers see the world  creating a view that s absurdly myopic  an odd little acting exercise for philip seymour hoffman and john hurt  two of the best actors of their respective generations  as channeled by the extraordinary hoffman  dan mahowny is less a freak than a nerve deadened everyman with the courage to search for something that makes him feel alive  the filmmakers have taken a bet that an unsexy  unpretty and unconventional movie about bank robbery and gambling can be as captivating as its flashier mainstream counterparts  and they ve won  
396,matrix_reloaded,the whole film may be more than a bit suspect cerebrally  with dime store philosophy  potted mysticism and cut price otherworldliness  but visually it gives full value as a virtuoso workout for your senses  indeed  if you loved the first matrix and its mix of comic book angst  martial arts  virtual reality  video game punch ups  pop philosophy  biblical subtext  romance  tragedy and pathos  then you won t be disappointed  electrifying but still violent 2nd in trilogy  if you re 14 or younger in age or sensibility  you may giggle at some of the bons mots  a smorgasbord of speed  noise  exhilaration  violence and unmitigated how did they do that glee  this might be the car chase to end all car chases   even with the supremely cheesy techno music  the technical talent is there  the problem is the script  which never once pauses to consider its own essential silliness  i liked this movie and can recommend it with a clear critical conscience  but it never moved me even half as much as steven spielberg s a i  an unqualified triumph for the many artisans who brought to life some of the most audacious and astonishing action sequences you are likely to see for a decade  it all adds up to 138 minutes of very high quality entertainment  and it s not often the time whizzes by as entertainingly as this  you don t have to buy into the geeky mythmaking in the matrix reloaded in order to enjoy its kinetic pleasures  there s only so much rubik s cubism a film can handle  and reloaded is awash in sci fi and religious overtones that continually bog down the film s forward motion  digital millions die in movies a lot now  but who gives a rat s  they re all just zeros and ones  unless there s some visibly human traits  it s hard to care  
397,tupac_resurrection,it never addresses the problem that the more tupac opens his mouth to explain what his music is or isn t about  and what role in society it is or isn t supposed to serve  the more obvious it becomes that his views aren t reflected in the actual music  it s great to hear a person no longer with us captured so bountifully in interviews  talking and even bubbling about his friends  his legacy and his scrapes  while tupac  resurrection includes some never before  seen family photos and performance footage  and excerpts from the late rapper s journals  it offers little in the way of new information or insight into the rapper s world  intriguing but ultimately frustrating  a strong film  with some genuinely revealing insights into the life of its charismatic and paradoxical subject  the movie is like an extra strength episode of mtv s diary  which is like a e biography in the first person  an open ended  honest portrait of a hugely talented young man  
398,friday_night,might make action fans pull their hair out  ziplessness has rarely looked so inviting  nor have a couple of actors seemed so much like real people  
399,house_of_sand_and_fog,you feel you not only know these people but where they come from  
400,incredibles,deliriously smart escapist fare  
401,sideways,payne does know how to capture two kinds of male menopause  but i can t say he ever surprised me  maintains a deft balance between breezy joviality and understated poignancy  this isn t the sort of road comedy we re used to seeing  its humor is more likely to provoke smiles and light chuckles than guffaws  sideways is one of those films that s a bit too good to review  it strikes a unique tone  blends a bit of tall tale fun with everyday life  and pretty much hits every note in your psyche  
402,spiderman_2,raimi has finally recaptured the manic charge he brought to evil dead 2  
403,maria_full_of_grace,the movie puts us in maria s shoes  taking us step by suspenseful step through her physical and spiritual ordeal  what s remarkable about marston s filmmaking is his ability to present scenes of shocking defilement without a hint of gratuitousness  
404,moolaade,the director has reached that point in his career where craft disappears behind grace  
405,twilight_samurai,well worth watching  rich in the kind of economic and social detail that explains how most samurai managed to live out their lives with only infrequent bursts of martial glory  
406,hero,the result is not so much a historical epic as a kind of highly determined ballet  dreamy with bloodless violence  relying less on shades of character than on magnificence of gesture  the austerity of hero makes you realize how cluttered other action movies are  as a technical achievement  hero finds zhang at the height of his powers  effortlessly expanding into complex genre filmmaking without losing his command  but in light of his earlier work  the film continues a sharp decline in urgency  dishes up some of the most extravagant doodling in cinema  strikes a mildly resonant chord  you ll be hard pressed to find anything as visually dazzling as this in cinemas ever  mortal wounds are delivered and received like love letters  even the plot is a piece of poetry  intensely formal and hopelessly sentimental visually spectacular but slight on story  i wouldn t have missed this spectacle for the world  and neither should you    despite an admitted quirk in my political sensibility in these contentious times that keeps me from admiring the film wholeheartedly  an orgy of color and movement  hero s balletic but virtually bloodless violence harnesses the forces of nature in a thoroughly unique way  the elegant precision of the ravishing images gives each scene a timeless beauty  so deliriously chockablock with high flying  color coordinated fight scenes that non aficionados may find it all a bit bewildering    a gorgeous abstraction  it sure is gorgeous  though  and it has a dream cast  on one level  hero represents a return to wuxia convention  yet there s nothing even marginally conventional about its overpowering visual splendor  
407,eternal_sunshine_of_the_spotless_mind,it s a surprising  clever sci fi twist  even as the relationship drama it dredges up doesn t feel at all like science fiction  for all its high falutin  references this is just another rom com with a bit of angst and ontological confusion thrown into the mix  the result is a cinematic vagueness that makes the film less aesthetic yet more persuasive  this is how dreams really look  like reality  only less so  it s a very kaufmanesque narrative experiment  technically ingenious and sophisticated  it also looks like some lost comedy idea by philip k dick  you could call this film we can forget it for you retail  works marvel after marvel in expressing the bewildering beauty and existential horror of being trapped inside one s own addled mind  and in allegorising the self preserving amnesia of a broken but hopeful heart  a unique deconstruction of man s innate desire to avert heartache  it is not as fiendishly cunning as being john malkovich or as savage as adaptation  but the surreal romantic twists are pure kaufman at his neurotic worst there is little charm in the coupling and almost no erotic intimacy  just a series of nerve racking conversational collisions  a wildly imaginative  hugely entertaining tour de force that asks big questions about life and love and fate while never ceasing to fully engage the viewer  a delightful little wormhole that takes us on a journey to another dimension of consciousness  the disappointment i felt at the end of eternal sunshine was almost crushing  simply because there were sections of it that were as daring in their emotional directness as anything i ve seen in years  
408,before_sunset,it s a lovely  beguiling little film a rare treat during this overheated season of blockbusters  it s also an unusual example of a follow up that doesn t seem forced  but expands effortlessly on the original  the reunion has some lively moments  but a great deal of slow walking and fatuous talking about love  married life and sex  shooting in long takes  linklater and his actors  who get co screenwriting credit  allow the conversation to curlicue effortlessly from literate banter to matters of the heart  and sometimes to places in between  charming  talky romance for older teens and adults  before sunrise and before sunset are a rare case of two movies that rightfully demand yet another sequel  mr  linklater and his two creative leads have managed a miraculous transformation of the characters from once callow lovers into grown ups teetering on the edge of eternity  what is to all intents and purposes 80 minutes worth of stolen moments  turns out to be one of the most rewarding films of the year allows you to watch two deeply engaged and engaging performers moving verbally through delicately negotiated layers of delight  apprehension  desire and surrender  hawke and delpy are credited with writing some of the dialogue  presumably as improvisations  they manage to be both natural and intense  and their characters feel real  even if the situation does not  how often does a visual medium make such an elegant argument about the beauty of language  even as it asserts its right to tell a story and move us with its vision  for my money  sunset tops the first installment because it involves characters who have more life under their belts  nothing like a few years to clarify a personality  
409,osama,like mohsen makhmalbaf s garlanded kandahar  siddiq barmak s osama springs up colourful and frightening  we ve heard so much about the cruelty of the taliban that we think we ve heard it all  but there s something about seeing one small human story played out that is still overwhelming  barmak proves an able craftsman  if the film s story stammers here and there  its overall power can t be denied  we are certainly entitled to marvel at its very existence  but that isn t enough  the work itself is extraordinary  
410,shaun_of_the_dead,george romero s zombie trilogy has generated an endless parade of remakes and rip offs  but this clever british spoof comes closer than many to the bitter satire that makes his movies so distinctive  
411,million_dollar_baby,violent oscar winner is inspiring but too intense for kids  quietly quite magnificent  
412,the_return,constructed like an eerie  metaphorical thriller  this tense  riveting character study offers viewers nearly two hours of emotions with a stunning pay off no one will be expecting  
413,control_room,fascinating documentary for mature older teens   given that most americans know the network only by reputation  or via donald rumsfeld s public denunciations of it  a little more objective information would not have gone amiss  modest in scope and not as well structured as it could have been  control room may not seem all that compelling 10 years down the road  but right now  at this very moment  it is essential  imperative viewing  more illuminating than not  and shines its brightest light on a truth that war and warmongers so ferociously ignore  look hard into the other s camp and what you ll likely see is yourself  a perceptive picture of the way in which modern warfare has turned the information battle into its permanent second front  americans watch cnn  the arab world watches al jazeera  this movie watches both and helps us understand how no attempt or pretense of objectivity can ever escape bias  enlightening  if structurally relaxed documentary  this engrossing portrait of competing notions of truth is at once a thrilling real time chronicle of the birth of a free press and a sophisticated philosophical treatise on the nature of objective reality  it does a good job of showing just how much media manipulation is taken for granted by those who have the job of massaging the facts and the ones who simply lie back and enjoy it  the value in control room is simply that it shows what america never got to see while also serving as a reminder that nobody serves up the real truth  everybody just serves up their truth  a glimpse of a world where everything is reversed  where our most cherished preconceptions are called into question and reality proves to be a more complex business than we imagined  control room should be required viewing for anyone within reach of a tv signal  for those who are interested in wartime truth  this film reminds us that the casualty has been somewhat reduced  without being didactic  the documentary raises important issues about bias and objectivity  
414,touching_the_void,about a primal war waged by man against both himself and the natural world that surrounds him

417,since_otar_left,otar and lenin make terrific bookends on the post communist experience for average citizens  a film  in which fictional characters become human by talking as real people really talk  
418,plagues_and_pleasures_on_the_salton_sea,plagues and pleasures has a different style for a reason  it s a movie about the environment that isn t content with the good bad dynamic of your average gloomy enviropic  john waters  dry narration suits the surreal  comic material  while the doc flounders as a coherent story of human folly  it s a cheeky travelmercial guaranteed to get the curious to make the road trip to this near abandoned resort  plagues and pleasures is simultaneously fun and creepy  best appreciated by those who enjoy similar profiles of detroit s crumbling grandeur  narrated with morbid relish by john waters  this witty doc chronicles the rise and ruination of the salton sea  a tiny inland ocean once promoted as  california s riviera  but now a festering  apocalyptically hideous ecological disaster zone   an  occasionally lighthearted but always affecting cautionary tale  this is a startlingly funny portrait of gothic americana  if it s not likely to send you scurrying off to the place on your next vacation  it s still a fascinating  nutty story  a kind of chinatown gone wrong  or gone more wrong    takes a light and lively approach to the local population  consisting of transplanted oddballs and stubborn survivors drawn to the sea s calm  sunny environs and isolated  crime free lifestyle  jaunty and fun for a while  with a cast of colorful locals who make the residents of vernon  florida seem normal  pic ultimately overstays its welcome and overstates its case  although the lake may be slowly dying  it is still beloved by a motley bunch of eccentrics who are profiled in the highly entertaining documentary plagues and pleasures on the salton sea  
419,super_size_me,might help shake the mcfaithful out of their special sauce stupors  consumption will lead to possible nausea and certain amusement  although spurlock s movie is thought provoking and downright funny  he doesn t exactly play fair  those who see the film will think twice before succumbing to that next big mac attack  
420,hotel_rwanda,cheadle  in his richest role since devil in a blue dress  burrows deep inside this complex man  who discovers in himself a strength he never knew he possessed as he faces the disillusion of all the  civilized  notions he believes in  there s a tidiness and sense of convenience in the film s stock characterisations and button pushing plotting that detracts from its impact  the film doesn t just contrive to contain the slaughter  but also its own anger  who cares about overdone orchestral blasts or signpost waving lines of dialogue when such raw  naked  painful humanity is displayed by don cheadle in the central role  showing traces of the well meaning paternalism that dogs many western films about africa  hotel rwanda doesn t go far enough in indicting europeans and americans for protecting their own while failing to intervene in time to stop the mass killings  incapable of honestly confronting its ugly subject matter  the emotion comes from don cheadle s thrilling portrait of ordinary heroism  a performance that s matched only by the magnificent sophie okonedo as his wife tatiana  the almost forgotten but all too real african genocide documented in hotel rwanda hits us as suddenly and as hard as it does paul rusesabagina  the accidental hero played so masterfully by don cheadle  it has a genuine power  the ability of film to beam light onto dark days of history  making it impossible for us to look away  reminding us of what we should never forget  what makes the film not just harrowing but transcendent is cheadle  he does nothing traditionally heroic  he just presents a picture of basic decency  showing how  when combined with courage  decency can result in an awe  inspiring moral steadfastness  because of the subject matter  this feels like one of those films you see because it s good for you  but it also is an extraordinarily moving drama  there is much to respect in hotel rwanda  not least cheadle s subtly crafted performance  which allows the audience a direct connection to his ethical growth

422,vera_drake,the heroine of mike leigh s wonderfully subtle and relentlessly harrowing new film is a cheerful  compactly built middle aged woman who spends her waking hours in perpetual motion  puts a tender human face on this explosive subject  aside from the performances  which are uniformly excellent  the greatest strength of mike leigh s drama is its non judgmental stance on abortion  all the actors so completely fade away that you come out of the film thinking you ve seen the real people  not players reciting a script  staunton is absolutely astonishing in the title role of this quiet  sad film about the dangers and consequences of what we could call the pre choice era  vera drake makes a compelling argument for women s rights without ever succumbing to preachiness  
423,end_of_the_century_the_story_of_the_ramones,a comprehensive look at the punk pioneers that never wears out its welcome  the revelations may even deepen your appreciation for the music    it s incredible that so much dumb fun was generated out of such pain  a film that does a fine job explaining their importance without airbrushing their foibles  offers a fascinating chronicle of the birth  glory days and waning years of a motorcycle jacketed  bowl haircutted quartet of middle class geeks who unwittingly spawned the punk movement  does justice to the humble punk band from queens that influenced everyone from the clash and sex pistols to u2 and green day  what audiences will want to talk about is the way the film reveals the quixotic human dynamic between the band members  the personal neuroses that simultaneously kept the group together and pulled it apart  
424,shrek_2,the animation by which it stands or falls is as brilliant as ever and  though it wouldn t really be right to call it totally anti disney  it certainly trumps that institution for sharpness of focus  notably as far as the screenplay is concerned  go and see shrek 2  you ll enjoy yourself thoroughly  only the churlish could find any faults  can an ogre live happily ever after  can fairy tale characters be content with their fairy tale lives  can an oscar winning animated success generate a successful sequel  to all these questions  shrek 2 is happy to answer yes  yes and yes  this second edition of dreamworks s oscar winning ogre opus may not match the original for  well  originality  but it honors the prime injunction governing sequels  to thine own characters be true  like the first movie this is unassailable family entertainment  with a gentle fairy tale for kids and a raft of mildly satirical pop culture references for parents  delivers neither less  nor more  than its wildly popular predecessor  while shrek 2 bowls merrily along on the fuel of firecracker wit and knowing pastiche that made the original so memorable  it will come as no surprise that second time around we don t feel quite so discombobulated by its brilliance  manages to undo much of what made its predecessor such a computer generated joy ride  an enjoyable if not especially imaginative sequel  gauged simply as a gag fest  this is a jolly rib tickle from start to big finish for anyone between six and death  however  it is stretched thinly in development of plot and character  the humor is so satisfying in its moment to moment pleasures that it s almost unsportsmanlike to criticize the bigger picture  
425,kinsey,he s a terribly flawed man but instead of soapy histrionics  condon underlines the tragedy with outrageous humour  the shame is that the film doesn t convey more mess or danger  its sex and its politics are almost entirely dinner table friendly  liam neeson somehow knits kinsey s qualities together in a likeable human pattern  captures authentic truth by refusing to lionize its far from perfect subject  condon has a real knack for making biopics breathe  the great thing about kinsey is the triumphant way it entertains  informs and electrifies us with the highest values of traditional cinema while opening our hearts and minds with the liberating potential of human diversity  the biopic succumbs to a paint by numbers feel as it dutifully touches the highs and lows of a life that can t easily fit within two hours  smart  eloquent and refreshingly free of condescension  kinsey makes clear we d all be a lot worse off without him  one heck of a flick  paying homage to an imperfect man whose impact on history may be substantial  and yet painting him as a clumsy  passionate fellow who s simply trying to figure things out  
426,lost_boys_of_sudan,offers an opportunity to see a good movie and learn something about an issue that has received far too little attention in the u s  press  it might help you understand an unfamiliar face walking toward you on the street  and that s a great accomplishment for any film  a documentary about two refugees who come to the united states  it offers a detailed look at the hurdles they face but makes no attempt to analyze  explain or advocate changes that would help them  lacking that exotic  foreign  focus and by failing to address the hardships of their early lives  we re left with a routine film about teenagers making mistakes or growing up too fast  reveals with remarkable clarity the clash of dreams vs  reality  hope vs  day to day despair  it s not as illuminating as it could be  but it sheds light just the same  too short by half  lost boys of sudan affords frustratingly little by way of real analysis and history  but it does introduce us to two extraordinary young men whose faith in this country is almost as unbearably sad as their stories  a potent  engrossing look at several young refugees from sudan s disastrous  endless civil war who ve been relocated to the u s  lost boys of sudan provides gripping evidence of just how costly it is to wear the shoes of an imperiled non american who is rescued by uncle sam  
427,agronomist,the hero of free speech  his voice so musical  cuts a memorable figure  free speech isn t merely a shibboleth in the agronomist  as embodied by dominique  it s a fire breathing force  a lively  illuminating homage to an extraordinary man of courage  whose cry for his beloved country got him killed  it tells instead of shows for the most part  and the telling isn t as effective as it should be  with haiti again in the news  the agronomist is an apt history lesson about its political turmoil and a powerful testimonial about patriotism in the face of oppression  a thoroughly fascinating look at a man with a mind that is subtle  sensitive and alert to life s nuances  we are left with vivid images of dominique  whose desire to change his country  despite formidable intimidation  is an inspiration to any supporter of democracy  a thoroughly absorbing and deeply affecting portrait of an extraordinary leader  we watch dominique use humor and cynicism as well as anger  and we understand he is not a zealot but simply a reasonable man saying reasonable things in an unreasonable country  teeming with the profound chaos and more profound harmony of modern haiti  a labor of love in the best sense  both a ferocious indictment of the corrupt dictatorships that have subjugated haiti for decades  sometimes with american support  and a stirring salute to a fallen comrade  dominique  what comes through more than anything is dominique s resolve    and the ways that haitian leaders tried to stop him  reminds us of previous events in the country s history  as told by a haitian who impresses us as someone honestly looking for nothing more than peace  
428,riding_giants,by the end  you re numb from the waves of information crashing down on your head but you re also worn out and happy  unexpectedly touched by the story of men who climbed the highest mountain around  
429,nobody_knows,it should come as no surprise that teenage actor yagira won the acting prize at the cannes film festival last year  watching him  you ll feel like handing him the trophy yourself  
430,my_architect,the young kahn is not a graceful filmmaker  yet the subject matter is engrossing for anyone interested in architecture and also one of its greatest practitioners  isn t a bad place to begin if you re curious about architecture and don t know much about louis kahn  does nathaniel finally find his father  if so  it s neither to excuse nor to condemn him  but to do what he was unable properly to do at his father s wake  say goodbye  my architect contrasts personal history and public legacy to captivating effect  those buildings are remarkably photogenic  particularly the government building in bangladesh  which is a masterpiece  an ideal mix of modernity and ancient splendor  one of the most moving nonfiction films in recent memory  almost against reason  nathaniel kahn makes his compulsions work for him  his irritating ways lead to insight  his insistent need for attention ends up making the film more than it unmakes it  
431,tarnation,there s no doubting the deep love caouette feels for his troubled mother  nor his achievement in forging such a rawly emotional film from his own traumatic experiences  nearly impossible to watch  thoroughly unpleasant yet strangely arresting  the movie climbs inside your head and rattles your consciousness  tinged with nostalgia and flooded with narcissism  this isn t easy to watch  but caouette s fractured history is imbued with heart crushing sincerity  
432,the-bridesmaid,chabrol develops the situation with sly restraint  while eduardo serra s cinematography generates a palpable sense of provincial menace  this 2004 french feature seems concerned not so much with the psychopathology of everyday life as with psychopaths who lurk behind the everyday  a superbly unsettling crime drama about a seemingly ordinary family  ravaged by passions that descend on them like a plague  at age 76 with 54 films to his credit  chabrol can do little wrong and pretty much whatever he likes  grips you from beginning to end  a merrily macabre things we do  for love yarn  it uses the extraordinary craft chabrol has acquired over the decades to insinuate itself inside our psyches in unexpected and potent ways  certainly  the bridesmaid is the most compelling film i have seen this year since jean pierre melville s army of shadows  smet  the 22 year old daughter of nathalie baye and french musician johnny hallyday  has a hauntingly beautiful face and carries senta s enigmatic nature well  
433,downfall,viewed through a north american lens  the movie itself seems more familiar than fascinating  more innocuous than inflammatory  and  at 21 2 hours  more tedious than anything else  ganz seems to find exactly the right pitch  his hitler feels real and human  yet there s nothing particularly ingratiating or sentimentalized about him  we never forget who he is  succeeds  perhaps too well for us to believe hitler was some aberration who could never happen again  
434,collateral,cruise lacked the deepdown malevolence required to bring vincent to life  i wished him dead in the first few minutes he was on the screen    and for the wrong reasons  a visually striking film from the unhinged  endlessly creative mind of michael mann  in the homestretch the thrills get too generic and farfetched for their own good  but the first two thirds are a knockout  enjoyably unbelievable  perhaps the best premise for thrills since speed  only this time the bad guy s on board and the battle of wits is more philosophical debate than pop quiz  there s another  more interesting movie lurking behind the pulp  glimpsed fleetingly in a stunningly angled shot or a tantalizing line of dialogue  throughout the gruesome cat and mouse game being played by vincent and max in collateral  there s something psychologically  dramatically and even sociologically interesting going on  most of the time we are with cruise and foxx  and their interplay is never less than galvanizing  the best of studio filmmaking  big stars and intense action sequences  with all the better elements of innovative indie filmmaking  original conception and gritty production values   what s special about michael mann s new crime thriller collateral isn t that it treads new ground or goes in new directions but that it is so naturally rhythmic to the cadences of multifaceted humanity  after that promising start  collateral ratchets down  gradually  to being only average  a crime drama made with immense skill  
435,good_bye_lenin,non germans will certainly get the essence of the humor but may find the movie long and repetitive  a funny movie that rises above farce to the level of sophisticated satire  the film seems overlong and drawn out  with variations on the same joke occurring throughout  watching becker invent new challenges and new solutions in scene after scene makes good bye  lenin  a joyous show  blurred by tears of sympathy  serves up an odd but intriguing situation  it is no doubt filled with references and in jokes we do not quite understand  but the central idea travels well  becker ably milks the premise for irony and amusement  like the east german pickles alex finds for his mother  it s a tasty but evasive treat  no matter what your taste in politics or movies  combination of comedy and gravity is certainly common enough  but it requires a sure hand and perceptible intent  this screenplay has some neat touches  but it never makes up its mind  beneath the family saga and easy digs at the tackiness of western consumer culture  becker presents a serious critique of authoritarianism and propaganda  it s mainly a hunt for ironies  usually playful but occasionally poignant  and the search is definitely successful enough to merit our attention    although maybe not the two hour running time  the impulses to entertain and enlighten are at odds here  and the final result ends up landing somewhere in between  smart  funny  but rarely both at the same time  
436,aviator,despite a pacy  technically brilliant but otherwise slightly ordinary first half hour or so  scorsese s howard hughes movie is his best since the age of innocence  scorsese gives us a lot more than the charles foster kane of the clouds  he keeps focus on hughes  the dreamer  who continually reached out  grabbed the future and pulled it toward him  it s a measure of the aviator s complexity and ambiguity that it can be read equally as a celebration of rugged  capitalist individualism and as a leftist critique of cutthroat free market competition  its primary appeal is its speed  it rushes along  from scandal to air crash to movie romance to senate hearing  each anecdote well realized but never tarried over  dicaprio remains a lightweight presence  a cherubic man child who one could sooner imagine fiddling with an airfix set and glue than spearheading the adventure of modern aviation  you can almost feel scorsese exorcising the specter of gangs of new york in the first act  it s bravura  classic hollywood filmmaking  and you like to think that hughes himself would have viewed it  if not appreciatively  then at least with a sense of kinship  by and large i think this movie s chief function is to give scorsese an opportunity to indulge in the pleasures of big time filmmaking and to treat the audience to a heady dose of glamour  
437,kitchen_stories,kitchen stories is so subtle that many viewers will not be aware that it s screamingly funny  don t expect a profound dish  do prepare for a light meal with enough oddball humor to maintain involvement  rather than simply beating the dead horse of utopian socialist engineering plans  kitchen stories serves to champion human irrepressibility and unpredictability  
438,mean_creek,this movie about teens is for adults only  a low key  low budget thriller that reminds us just how cruel young people can be  estes has accomplished quite a bit here  in addition to providing a textbook example of suspense  he also makes us want to know what happens to these kids after the screen goes dark  as odd as it may sound  the best of the many good things that can be said of writer director jacob aaron estes  debut feature mean creek is that it could have been written by a teenager  there are all sorts of other themes at work below the surface  including examinations of teenage peer pressure and moral responsibility  watching them finally come together in universal realizations as to what has transpired and their parts played in it is like watching greek tragedy in my own backyard  estes dives into this material as if it s never been done before  and his characters and situations are so realistic and the film s tone is so assured that he succeeds at making it feel fresh  an unusually truthful depiction of the way kids today talk  think and act  exceptionally strong performances from the entire cast draw you into the movie s deliberately provocative world  takes its place alongside stand by me and river s edge as one of very few films to accurately portray the experience of growing up male  
439,my_summer_of_love,pawlikowski doesn t spend much time explaining his characters or telling us why they do what they do  and that s exactly why they remain so compelling  a remarkable if brief entrance into real psychologies  
440,shaolin_soccer,untraditional underdog sports team story  
441,metallica_some_kind_of_monster,fans of the band will love the revealing footage  especially landmark moments such as bassist auditions  more famous names showed up than the one they picked  and encounters with the ex metallica members  newsted and megadeth frontman dave mustaine   if you re a fan  you will almost certainly be touched by this effort to put an entire dysfunctional band on the couch  and if you re not  well  you re going to giggle  an unflinching and often hilarious look at the humanity of these heavy metal gods  it s great emotional fodder for old school metallica fans and smart  tugging drama for people unfamiliar with the band  by the time this fascinating two hour  and 20 minute film ends  you ll have seen the group rise from the ashes of its own massive discontent  overkill to anyone who never flashed the group s devil horns salute  metallica  some kind of monster doesn t require you to know anything about the band metallica or heavy metal music  but it supplies a lot of information about various kinds of monsters  no rock doc has burrowed so deeply into the bruised egos  arrested development and internal conflict that make up a superstar band  a counterintuitive  riveting documentary so honest that it will either become a rock movie classic or a severe embarrassment for the heavy metal band  berlinger and sinofsky manage something remarkable  they connect us to the actual people who comprise metallica  the former working  and middle class california kids who have now spent half their lives rich and famous  
442,bad_education,crime and deception have rarely looked so sumptuous  
443,corporation,this documentary s extra long running time and a narrator who sounds like a sedated star trek computer won t win many converts  an impassioned polemic  filled with information sure to break up any dinner table conversation  
444,house_of_flying_daggers,martial arts have rarely been filmed with so much artistry  like an extraordinary looking but intellectually limited fashion model  
445,woodsman,a lean drama anchored by subject matter which  although difficult  remains distantly disquieting yet never challenging  bacon deservedly has received most of the attention here  but sedgwick  who doesn t work nearly enough  brings grit and hardscrabble realism to the role of a woman who has turned defiance into a protective shield  a sometimes disturbing yet equally revealing film that examines the motivations of our worst societal outcasts and tries to make some sense of it all  this by turns unsettling and inspiring drama offers no easy answers  let alone identifiable heroes or villains  
446,garden_state,garden state may not define an entire generation  but it has a sharp eye for the passive aimlessness that can take hold when young adults realize there s no handbook on how to find purpose and meaning in life  
447,kill_bill_volume_2,if he doesn t take care tarantino could make something significantly worse  
448,going_upriver_the_long_war_of_john_kerry,this should be revelatory to most people    but most people will probably never see mr  butler s film  and certainly none of those who consider george w  bush as next to god  one of the most moving things for me was seeing that some of the high ranking politicians really did recognize that  hey  we need to meet with these young men and hear what they have to say and that footage is amazing stuff  butler is on record as a close friend of kerry s  but he s also a well respected documentarian  who introduced arnold schwarzenegger to america in pumping iron and chronicled the heroism of ernest shackleton in the endurance  filmgoers in the mood for one more go round will be fascinated by this documentary by george butler  a highly effective campaign biography  it underscores  with ample footage from his rallying speeches and his 1971 testimony before the senate foreign relations committee  just how important it was for the antiwar movement to be represented by someone like kerry  a lucid  emotionally affecting portrait not just of one man but of his times  what happened to the confident 27 year old we see in the movie  who stares down the police  a hostile nixon administration and unfriendly journalists to deliver impassioned first hand arguments against continuing the vietnam conflict  his deep knowledge of the now presidential candidate provides a portrait of a young man consumed by his mission  as he saw it  to save his country from itself  knowing this much about the frankly impressive early years of one candidate certainly casts him in a new light  one beyond the sound bites and attack ads  butler does an adroit job of indicating that john o neill   the architect of the present smear attacks on kerry s war record   has his own inglorious history  it is difficult to leave this movie without the conviction that kerry s wartime experience was anything but honorable  regardless of how you feel about his leadership role in vietnam veterans against the war  to be sure it s blatantly partisan  but this documentary about the current presidential candidate s youth is also a moving exploration of vietnam veterans who ended up protesting the very war they had fought in  an unabashed paean to kerry s character at a time in the presidential election when kerry s character is being questioned butler s film still manages to accomplish what the candidate s foundering campaign has utterly failed to do  
449,dig,this amped up rockumentary doubles as an essay on self destruction  
450,brothers_2004,though brothers is at times unexpectedly harrowing  it is neither a preachy anti war diatribe nor a triangulated domestic drama  but it does show how even little wars can disrupt the most harmonious families  psychologically complex and never less than riveting

452,james_journey_to_jerusalem,this darkly comic parable wonderfully contrasts modern corruptions against simple christian faith  
453,save_the_green_planet_2004,like any roller coaster ride  it may make you queasy  but you ll never be bored  works on a variety of levels  from gruesome slapstick comedy through social critique to genuinely chilling grand guignol  a dog named earth and aliens both domestic and imported rotate around one another in this self consciously freaky  rambunctiously goofy genre hybrid from south korea  unlike just about every other american action movie  this film knows how to embrace momentum without sacrificing challenges to the mind or the soul  makes you wonder just what new talent the increasingly inventive and idiosyncratic korean cinema is going to give us next  director writer jang jun hwan starts things off with a bang and never looks back  mad conspiracy rules in korean writer director jang jun hwan s snazzy  playful  somewhat gory  often hilarious  and generally unpredictable first feature  why do so many movies fall apart in the final reel  jeong s excuse is that this is his debut  but with a little restraint he could have pulled off a madcap coup with this ambitious blend of sci fi and serial killing slapstick  
454,last_life_in_the_universe, reflects  the growing interpenetration of many individual national cinemas into a cultural conglomerate that reflects the irresistible tide of cinematic globalization  the film has a precise  slow pace that allows us to get to know these quiet  quirky characters  and an imaginatively experimental approach to their thoughts and dreams  an absorbing series of intricately planned shots that play like installation art at a modern museum  there is some lovely filmmaking here  and nice surprises  the thai locales  the stars and doyle s expressive cinematography add up to a disarmingly seductive yet always precarious film experience  the mildly surreal drama doesn t always make sense  but it sure does look great  directed by the talented pen ek ratanaruang in a deadpan style that would be approved by finnish auteur aki kaurismaki  the master of deadpan  allusive  and enigmatic  this thai film is a wistful mood piece whose contemplative tone is periodically punctured with eruptions of violence  it s an unsuccessful experiment in combining genres that are as irreconcilable as oil and water  it may sound like a conventional tale  but this is full of magical surprises that occasionally ruffle its otherwise serene surface  
455,guerrilla-the-taking-of-patty-hearst,a mostly compelling and exceedingly fair minded look back at the case  a case study in cultural analysis that aims at too much and achieves too little  in retrospect the group s story is a painful example of the warped idealism of the radical left and its fateful romance with violence  gives a fascinating and alarming taste of how a 1974 kidnapping that now seems quaint has morphed into the monstrous terrorist tactic it is today  an in depth look at the sla  full of an impressive amount of historical footage and interviews with former members  journalists and other observers  the great achievement of guerrilla  the taking of patty hearst  besides its unearthing of gripping archival material and its groundbreaking new interviews  is its insistence on context rather than sensationalism  
456,distant,deeply compassionate and frequently amusing  qualifying as a minor miracle of humanely observant filmmaking  stuffed with unspoken thoughts and unspeakable feelings few recent films have been so accomplished in capturing the way people drift through their lives  unable to communicate their emotions and feelings  this precisely paced  sensitively performed drama speaks volumes about the growing distance that modern urban living is putting between people who would otherwise have so much in common  a sublime treat for anyone with a taste for subtly rendered  almost purely cinematic expression  has much to say about solitude and friendship and just plain coping with life  nuri bilge ceylan s wry  modest meditation on pettiness works on a minimalist scale  ceylan  who also served as cinematographer  frames the affecting  unstudied performances in gorgeously chosen shots and nonevents that sometimes teeter on the edge of comedy before knocking us breathless with their emotional power  the entire film is stitched together from a collection of long shots that stress the expansive emotional distance between the film s characters  
457,mean_girls,fizzes with peculiarly feminine evil  of the kind that comes dripping through a pillowy smirk garnished with baby pink lipgloss  though better written  better acted and with more wit and subtlety than your average teen flick  the atmosphere in mean girls with its promiscuous sex and well  meanness  make it almost as nasty to sit through as these girls are to each other  lacks the genuine bile that made heathers so bracing  happily  fey and waters gently tweak the studios  usual high gloss caricature of adolescence and aim for acutely hilarious and surprisingly empathic sociology  i would be more amused if the topic of rich material girls had not been worn to a thread elsewhere  proof that hollywood occasionally gets it right far from perfect  but it has brains beneath its glossy  vacuum packed beauty  steers toward familiar teen movie hyperbole  but it s the way the girls plot their sabotage while doling out empty compliments that keeps things real  as depicted here girl world is as complex and as full of shadowy espionage as a robert ludlum penned cia spy thriller it all seems  finally  as if fey is pulling her punches  an unusually defensive posture for her  
458,3_iron,for the most part they achieve a delicate balancing act  mixing near silent comedy with an old fashioned sense of whimsy  this enigmatic and in some ways maddening motion picture has the power to haunt every viewer it reaches  
459,finding_neverland,infused by an awkward decorum  the kind that descends on a gathering dominated by an unmentioned death or transgression  if it didn t have johnny depp as its star  finding neverland would barely pass muster as an average pbs masterpiece theatre entry  it s harmless cotton candy with pleasant turn of the century dcor  but i admit the disney ambiance eventually wore me out and i spent a lot of time looking at my watch  
460,fahrenheit_911,much more than a scathing indictment of dubya era complicity  michael moore s expos  lays bare the devastating heartbreak now central to america s wartime reality  controversial documentary best for older teens  unlike bowling for columbine  which editorially often seemed something less than the sum of its sketch comedy parts  fahrenheit 9 11 makes its case carefully and clearly  
461,touch-the-sound,a coy yet worthy profile of celebrated scottish percussionist evelyn glennie  the movie makes an interesting addition to what could become riedelsheimer s evolving and extraordinary gallery of movies that bring the creative process to life  it will be frustrating if you expect narrative and linear development  but if you take it on as a new point of view  valuable even if you don t completely comprehend it yet  touch the sound is worth the trip  unfortunately  a good deal of touch the music is devoted to vacuous interviews with glennie  who seems positively incapable of saying anything substantial  bold and often thrilling film  we listen to this film more intensely than is usually the case  like superior tracks on an exhausting double album  the individual moments of wonder in touch the sound are too powerful to dismiss  there is a maddening sense of dislocation through much of the movie    a feeling that genuinely fascinating questions have been squeezed out by woo woo philosophizing and material  like glennie s brief return to the family farm  of only minor import  this impressionistic documentary is a mystical exploration of the sensory world as experienced by a musician who lost most of her hearing as a teenager  educates in exhilarating ways  ways that are immediately applicable to how one lives one s life  it s rare that a documentary conveys an artist s worldview so compellingly  but then glennie is no ordinary musician  fans of the grammy winning musician will revel in the proximity to their idol  though second pic from talented helmer thomas riedelsheimer plays a tad long to those unfamiliar with his  or her  work

463,crimson_gold,i m glad i saw crimson gold  watching it is like getting a peek behind the curtain  a film both shocking and humane  as if taxi driver were somehow rewritten by chekhov  an eloquent look at a man made less human by the world around him  an engrossing tale of class differences that reveals tiny details of one man s descent into hell  this tough  bristling story about a working class man pushed over the edge vividly brings to mind the great hollywood social dramas of the 1930s  
464,1136293-lightning_in_a_bottle,any movie with ruth brown  bonnie raitt  mavis staples and aaron neville  with his brothers  for openers can t be all bad  this is the sort of concert film made for high end home theatre experiences  if you ever loved this kind of music  lightning will bring the reasons back  if you haven t  you ll likely wonder where this has been all your life  fuqua s film captures a night when lightning struck more than twice in the same place  
465,in_good_company,a so so script but great performances  even better  weitz asks tough questions without easy answers  pointing daggers at companies like the very one he s busy making motion pictures for  while in good company has a few moments of comedy that work  it inescapably feels like a sitcom  a warm and witty comedy brimming with sharp insights  not only the best american picture of 2004  but also the most grown up movie to come from hollywood in recent years  the script feels patched together and stale but there is a lot of compensation in exceptionally warm and fully realized performances by all of the principals  a bland  occasionally phlegmatic pastiche of cliches and dull encounters  ultimately  this workplace fairy tale creates its own cheer  when its time is up  you ll feel like you ve been in good company  if the rest of the movie were as good as scarlett  we might give a damn  a rare species  a feel good movie about big business  it s about a corporate culture that tries to be evil and fails  it s more fun than sideways and just as adult  but because it hews closer to genre formula  and therefore is somewhat more obvious   you ll find it on few if any top 10 lists  it is clever and thoughtful and has the added benefit of being about people you may recognize as fellow wage earners  for better or worse  topher grace  dennis quaid and scarlett johansson all turn in fine performances  but they all seem to tread water  waiting for the next big wave that doesn t come

467,sea_inside,can a movie be too well made for its own good  stylish and painterly  with moments of great lyricism  it flies over the spanish countryside to the sea   the film does everything in its power to escape the claustrophobia inherent in the story  if ever there was a film that deserved to get the proverbial bump from oscar  this is it  rarely has any film so focused on death felt so vibrantly alive  for whatever reason  it s an injustice that bardem was not nominated for best actor  bardem s ramn is such a vital life force  it s all the more bittersweet to watch him fight to leave a world that would be much emptier and sadder without him in it  ultimately  this is one man s story  told with great empathy  and amenbar deserves great credit for lifting the film above the soap opera sentimentality into which it could have easily fallen  amenbar shows us the aching depth of sampedro s loss and makes his most eloquent statement on behalf of a man who only wanted control of his destiny  in death is found a profound argument for life  this entire project easily could have turned into a weepy soap opera  but bardem keeps it on point  it comes as no surprise to learn that javier bardem  the virile and charismatic spanish actor  is capable of turning on the charisma even working only from the neck up  what is alarming is realizing that the rest of the movie he s in is paralyzed as well  never once does this film sacrifice its moral ideas or complexity of character on the cheap altar of sentimentality  soars to the fantastically romantic heights of love between a man and a woman  what could have been a preachy biopic becomes poetry in the hands of the gifted director and writer and editor and composer alejandro amenabar  amenbar  the inventive spaniard who made the others  promotes dignity  love  and inspiration with such insistence that there s relatively little chance to feel ramn sampedro s unendurable pain  
468,the_motorcycle_diaries,walter salles s well observed movie downplays politics for humanism  it s a picturesque tale that  hobbled by its episodic structure  never achieves full steam  it s about the gradual wakening into awareness  the graduation from carefree youth to responsible adulthood  whether you want to see the motorcycle diaries as entirely a personal story or as social and political allegory  it captures a far different and far more vulnerable ernesto guevara than the one we think we know  there are many moments that add up to a grander appreciation of a memorable journey and an unforgettable character  if i was moved despite my ingrained skepticism about ch  guevara and castro s cuba  you probably will be too  best savored as a beautifully photographed and scored road trip and as a character study of disparate men who somehow fit together as friends  
469,aileen_life_and_death_of_a_serial_killer,the film stands quite chillingly as a final statement from a woman trying to fight her own commodification   t his movie literally gave me the chills  provides an opportunity to study one of history s supposed anomalies  a female serial killer  does afford a real life view of wuornos during the days of her final appeal and her ultimate date with death  broomfield is too fond of himself by half  and tilts the movie too much toward his personal objections to the death penalty  it does     make a powerful argument against capital punishment  no matter which side of the debate you happen to take  her intense denial is fascinating  and extremely sad  to watch  no one should have to endure the life that aileen wuornos led  and we leave the movie believing that if someone  somehow  had been able to help that little girl  her seven victims would never have died  digs into the soul of this abused child  who never got the treatment she needed  her eyes  radiating madness  will haunt your dreams  though one can question the movie s quality as a documentary     aileen raises such troubling issues that it stays  hellishly  in your mind  it s a far more gripping documentary than broomfield s 1992 wuornos film  nick broomfield s documentary  which chronicles the events that led up to the execution of aileen wuornos  is an absorbing film  partly because its subject exudes a scary charisma  she was guilty  no doubt  but as this immensely moving film makes clear  aileen wuornos was also heartbreakingly human  
470,bright_leaves,bright leaves is not the kind of film that thetruth com would use in its anti smoking campaign  a gently provocative film diary about tobacco and its mixed legacy  bright leaves is a beguiling film  watching it is like spending time with an old  somewhat chatty but endearing friend  the mysteries mcelwee sets out to solve aren t very involving  and his meandering style  while charming first and literate  becomes repetitive and yes  even a little dull  inevitably poignant but also often amusing and always deeply touching  this film is likely to stick in one s memory for all its concerns  not just cigarettes  the results are brilliantly amusing  this is a movie that doesn t make you feel stupid on the way out or like someone has been spraying you in the face while making his talking points  the filmmaker s rich  husky voiced narration manages to shape this collection of half formed ideas and observations into a tightly packed little roll up that s worth taking a puff on  personal yet the opposite of egotistical  truthful yet playful  happily distractible yet patient  and above all grateful for those in the world he loves around him  mcelwee makes movies the way life might  ideally  be lived  mcelwee is digressive in the best sense  he takes the time to discover what people are like when they re being themselves  he wants to know where their lives are taking them  what byways they are going down  becomes both a mystery and memoir in progress and though the filmmaker does not find the truth he is looking for  it was clearly a quest worth undertaking  
471,yes_men,its willingness to mock not just the men in power suits but the journos and news organisations who swallow their ftse gibberish is salutary indeed  this sly little documentary packs a wickedly satiric punch  
472,friday_night_lights,few films have shown so powerfully the slashing double edge of sports fever  a heart pounding big screen treatment that captures all the action of a tumultuous season while showing the emotional toll on the players  the best sports movie for years  as it s not about sport at all  forget fears of jingoistic grandstanding  this is an un american all american tale that deserves attention  an excellent effort that packs a solid  emotional punch  its script is pure corn  drenched in syrupy sentiment and topped with prize ham in the shape of billy bob thornton s tub thumping coach  nuance typifies both mr  thornton s highly calibrated performance and the film s absence of unnecessary underlining  it has an intentionally rough  gritty  bleached  documentary feel but berg is in complete control  with every shot a small gem of precision and mastery  viewers will be able to read into the do or die philosophy whatever they choose  and in the meantime simply enjoy this big screen ode to the madness  substitutes slick  cynical point scoring for insight  friday night lights is the real deal  a grim  in your face expose of one west texas school s fanatical sports program  the story gestures at a cross sectional view of america on a nashville scale  there s an interesting movie struggling to get out of friday night lights  but every time it tries it gets rushed and tackled  people who like sports movies will love friday night lights  but so will people who don t like sports movies and would never think of seeing a high school football game  
473,hellboy,played by ron perlman  he s the most magnetic action hero i ve come across in a long while  though i couldn t make heads or tails of this story  most effective as a brief window into an era  it captures the bitter aftertaste of a counter cultural movement gone stale perlman plays the adult hellboy to perfection  part blustery  stogie chomping tough guy in a mean leather duster  and part angsty teenager  sick and tired of being confined to the bprd lest his appearance incite a riot among the general populace  this is the kind of movie you watch for its aura  for its appealing characters  for its marvelously sustained seriocomic romantic mood  del toro moves his story along with unrelenting energy and wit while introducing the opposing parties with admirable efficiency  easily the most adept comic book adaptation since ghost world  if you don t normally go to films where the lead characters look like giant pez dispensers  the slogging fights of hellboy may seem like purgatory  but there s enough going on in between the big action sequences to save the movie from mediocrity  for all the monstrous eviscerations  there s no real heart here  
474,monster,powerful  painful for mature audiences only  i can forgive the oscar  winning makeover  but not the script doctored romance in the same way the beefed up theron fills the movie s tightly composed frames to bursting while pushing everything else to the margins  her showstopping rage blows through film like a tornado  if the film is a bit too soft on its subject  it is even more taken with its leading lady  theron overwhelms  first time director patty jenkins takes us inside a year in wuornos  turbulent life  building her movie around theron s dynamite performance  raw  exposed and nerve wracking in its immediacy   theron  captures the essence of the woman  a lifelong victim who preys on her customers with the determined sadness of someone who has finally snapped inside  
475,manchurian_candidate,good as the players are  they can t make this hokum remotely believable  jonathan demme s new manchurian candidate is a gourmet popcorn movie  a hugely entertaining thriller shot through with dark shards of agony and paranoia  it takes nothing away from the original while delivering pleasures all its own  happily  this extremely timely entertainment matches  even perhaps surpasses its predecessor  impressively accomplished and highly entertaining  with sufficiently smart new twists to keep you guessing all the way to the nerve wracking climax  an exhilarating  if politically wishy washy  modern day reimagining of frankenheimer s gem  an intelligent  provocative blockbuster that succeeds on its own merits  far from a disgrace  but it s not freewheeling enough  not strange enough to make sense of our gathering dread  and if it doesn t quite come together like it appears it is going to early on  it s still a much better attempt at remake than one could have possibly hoped for  the first version was acidulous and brazenly absurd  this one is doggedly  wretchedly earnest  a picture that purports to have a galvanizing  liberal minded theme  big business is taking over our country and our lives  but is really just ploddingly pedestrian  
476,outfoxed_rupert_murdochs_war_on_journalism,an often grave but sometimes hilarious picture of a hugely powerful network  when those talking heads metamorphose into familiar ranting heads  it becomes another mesmerizing right wing horror show  greenwald s central thesis rings true  
477,wilbur_wants_to_kill_himself,unexpected plot twists keep us interested  though scherfig is still partially enrolled in the dogme school  her movie finds a happy balance with its equally adept eye for wide screen composition and the raw complexity of real human emotion  here is a movie that appeals to the heart while not insulting the mind or forgetting how delightful its characters are  it starts as a black comedy about suicide along the lines of harold and maude  then softens into a well meant but sentimental piece about terminal illness  
478,miracle,if you can tolerate all this phony uplift you ll also get a pretty interesting story about a shrewd minnesota college coach named herb brooks  i don t know that i ve ever felt more involved in fictional competition than i was throughout this movie  and i can t tell a hockey puck from cow pie  
479,somersault,my impression remained this time around of an unfinished screenplay in which too many intervals of small talk masqueraded as the forerunners of emotional events that never materialized  heavy on atmosphere but very light on plot  reflects surprisingly assured filmmaking sensibilities  especially when it comes to portraying the foibles and preoccupations of young women at loose ends  shortland appears to have a great fascination with objects like pine needles and gas jets  but the pic s visual flourishes tend to be distracting in their restless artiness  
480,red_lights,puts a tense  deteriorating marriage on a highway bound collision course with a killer  thriller mystery buffs might find the narrative slow  the thriller elements aren t introduced until the movie is nearly half over  and the mystery starts even later  but a dandy payoff will reward those who are patient  the most ambiguously compelling romance around  subtle and stylish  red lights will remind moviegoers not only of ms   flannery  o connor but also of alfred hitchcock  like hitchcock  kahn uses dry humor and keen observation of human character  and character flaws  to spin a compelling brand of menace  the film  like the cheap double scotches quaffed down by the central character  leaves a distinctly sour aftertaste that s hard to wash away the morning after  as thrillers go  this one is domestic  mundane and hypnotic  an eerily affecting domestic drama combining elements of the lost weekend with lost highway  a weird road trip spin on sam peckinpah s straw dogs  red lights blends the blind tension of hitchcock with a french sense of inevitability  leading us back and forth between action and surrender before ending just where it should  
481,ray,excellent portrayal of extraordinary musician  jamie foxx s all encompassing performance in the title role more than justifies the early oscar gossip it has generated  eminently worth seeing  about as loyal a portrait as its subject could have wanted  although for our sake  hackford might have given us more of the man and less of the legend  vibrantly intelligent and tough minded  any viewers who look at ray and see only clich s are declaring themselves hopelessly lost to the real achievement of this picture  which is nothing less than a statement of faith in the inclusiveness of american culture  foxx helps us to truly understand how much charles  blindness allows him to achieve  especially when combined with an innate wiliness  
482,up_and_down,when you understand its message  the film takes on a different level  hrebejk s stylish direction and perfectly chosen cast make what might otherwise have been a depressing tale of post perestroika working class woes into a melancholy  comedic riff on what it means to be european these days  the movie asks us to see these people as humans and to forgive them for being human and doing to each other what humans beings do to each other  it s a deeply humane film  it manages the neat trick of being both charming and bilious  and its tart points about racism translate excellently into english  hebejk claims inspiration from the likes of mike leigh and woody allen  and that can be seen in the surety of the characters  brought to life by an able cast that includes former czech president vclav havel  an accomplished film that uses dark humor to leaven its serious topics  hrebejk wrings real poignancy out of the screenplay s wet rag of fateful coincidences and ill fated relationships  lacks any formulas or solutions  and is content to show us its complicated characters  their tangled lives  and the way that our need to love and be loved can lead us in opposite directions  it s been a long time since a movie allowed so many diverse narratives to fold into so unexpected  unified and satisfying a story  its emotional tone may be up and down  but its clear headed approach has straightforward snap  it s at least grappling with the kind of big  explosive questions that most filmmakers assiduously avoid  with great empathy for human foibles  filmmaker jan hrebejk shows that czechs don t always keep pace with their evolving  post soviet society  an absorbing look at a country still struggling to adjust more than a decade after the fall of communism  the clumsy humor doesn t translate well  
483,broadway_the_golden_age,old timers  showbiz buffs and big stage wanna bes will not be disappointed  these anecdotes come across with powerful emotion  although many of them relay oft documented events  
484,team_america_world_police,the whole thing plays like thunderbirds goes to hell and will doubtless offend all those numskulls who complained about the bbc s transmission of jerry springer  the opera  for that alone  it gets my vote  raunchy action comedy from south park team isn t for kids  there are too many gags that fall flat and the strain of an all marionette cast shows all too often  worse  it loses its edge early on  stone and parker not going far enough for the attacks to be anything other than purely prurient  i thought it was pretty clever  
485,a_very_long_engagement_2004,there s only so much candy the eye can consume before nausea sets in  merging heart wrenching emotions with quirky humor and splicing bloody war footage with goofy comedy  the movie mixes vastly disparate elements into a surprisingly smooth blend  what they cut from the novel     doesn t cause as many problems as what they add  which is often too bizarre or too whimsical for a story about death  there s something hollow beneath its polished surface  
486,saddest_music_in_the_world,from time to time during the 99 minute running time  i kept thinking of those old off off broadway impositions on wriggly audiences    or was it just me who was the transplanted village square trapped among all the hipsters  
487,1144992-crash,instead of heartwarming messages about forgiveness  it honours ambiguity and brings us close  closer than is comfortable  in fact  to what americans today are really thinking about one another  set in a simmering cauldron of racial tensions where subtle nuance can cut as deep as unambiguous hostility  it s a powerful drama about the often bewildering contradictions that underlie human behaviour  haggis moves seamlessly between all these stories and has structured them in such a way that his characters reach a crisis point simultaneously  followed by melancholy clarity  haggis shows a lot of promise as a director  his film is never dull  but he needs to unlearn some of the bad lessons he picked up working in tv  which demands that everything be neat  symmetrical and underlined  filters every scene  through the prism of race  but keeps turning the prism around and around until the colors no longer matter and we see only what the characters do  any relation to persons living or dead is purely coincidental  a haunting  perceptive and uncompromising examination of controversial subject matter  expertly written and directed by paul haggis and characterised by excellent performances from its starry cast  few films are as daring  few films this year are as deserving of your attention  this is how i felt leaving crash  i knew what i just watched wasn t perfect  too many coincidences  too many cliches  but the power of the performances  words and images refused to leave me alone  there are some powerful scenes that have a harrowing quality  i found mr  haggis  moralistic tales too facile for my taste  
488,two_brothers,noteworthy because it represents a kind of fevered moviemaking insanity that we rarely see these days  
489,machinist,until now bale s screen persona has been defined by a graceful athleticism  here his physicality is repellent  yet he carries the occasionally creaky plot of scott kosar s unsettling screenplay to a resonant finish  a few scenes into the gloom and you ll have a good idea what is generally up  if not the specifics  making the journey toward the eventual  inevitable twist fairly one dimensional  some people will pick up the clues early in the machinist and some won t  i got some  not all  but i remained unengaged throughout  largely because of the film s deliberateness  which feels like lack of passion  a gimmick with no real payoff  bale s performance has the emotional weight to substantiate this body art spectacle  ranging from prickly self righteousness through panicked self doubt to morbid self pity    it s one of those movies that you admire more than you enjoy  but anderson and kosar are clearly talents to watch  it begins dark and depressing  but ends up merely dull  though bale deserves all the credit that can be heaped at his feet     there is far more to this sinister psychological thriller than just exhibiting bale s emaciated form  anderson definitely has a flair for creating a diffuse sense of fear  paranoia  and mental illness onscreen  mainly this is all bale s show  he is strangely sympathetic  taking us right into trevor s pain without any special pleading  it s an overly calculated  schematic graph of a script that eliminates the things we go to the movies to experience  interesting characters  a story we can relate to  an emotional release  
490,daughter_from_danang,i m more familiar with jersey than with jay z  but i found it difficult to watch this concert  shot in 2003  without gaining some appreciation for the rapper s rapid fire verbal acrobatics  against a vibrant  well lit backdrop  he performs his biggest hits with an intensity and clarity that should allow even the uninitiated to appreciate the lyrical dexterity which makes him the genre s dean  the first rapper profiled on 60 minutes  much as with official corporate send offs  the excitement of this documentary builds steadily for about five minutes and then  before you know it  there s nothing left to see  relentlessly upbeat infomercial  mostly comprises rousing  well edited concert footage that shows off jay z s talent as a dynamic live performer  it will be interesting only to die hard hip hop enthusiasts  though fade to black veers into vanity production territory at such moments  it mostly is a triumph of stagecraft and speaker blowing freestyling  if you knew nothing else about rap  you d know from watching him in action that the man knows what he s doing  and  when you can hear what his audience is shouting back  you feel the burn of his energy and breadth of his power  the rapper jay z performs his own movie length swan song set to thumping rhythms in madison square garden  smartly directed by pat paulson and michael john warren and nicely lensed  the material sufficiently establishes the rarefied air jay z occupies  
491,tae_guk_gi_the_brotherhood_of_war,at times the performances seem more akin to the histrionics of old silent movies  when emotions had to be seen because they couldn t be heard  while tae guk gi s horrific imagery is peppered throughout with moments of surreal beauty  it remains one of the most realistic depictions of battlefield chaos i can think of  worth seeing for its sheer otherness at a time when americans are forced to look increasingly at the outside world for new information  epic in scope and violent in a way that every war film has to be since saving private ryan  taegukgi is a big time movie that never loses sight of its human story  the film does offer western viewers rare access to another country s innermost anxieties and contradictions  and as such is a fascinating document  successfully combines audience friendly sentimentality with absolutely grueling combat footage and an unexpected but unmistakable hostility toward the entire notion of war  writer director kang je gyu dedicates himself to the human side of a grand tale  to people who ve been uprooted by history  kang remains a superb technician  but somewhere the movie forgot to pack any genuine emotion along with its ordnance and k rations  it s an overwhelming vision far more realistic and insightful than the wacky mash unit through which most americans have seen this period  
492,dawn_of_the_dead,only gore thirsting teens will be satisfied  
493,1132642-mother,quite apart from her unclad courage in the sex scenes  62 year old anne reid conveys the dilemmas of her age and her hesitant path to liberation with extraordinary and moving subtlety  it sounds like the stuff of soap operas or bad porn  but kureishi s script is too intelligent and empathetic to titillate  the complications of its story are found in the deep complexities of emotions and family relationships  bracing but superb  though their selfishness is repellent  the characters feel strikingly real  it neither reassures nor insults its audience  these days  a film that doesn t insult your intelligence is absolutely refreshing  reid s magnificent portrayal of the indomitable may has been insufficiently appreciated both here and in england  she is nothing short of uncanny   michell  shows what can be accomplished on a small budget with a brilliant script and a cast that rarely makes a false move  
494,overnight,enjoyable because you get to see a huge ego and shameless publicist get his comeuppence  cautionary tales about the pitfalls of indie filmmaking don t come more searingly truthful or sober minded than overnight  
495,goodbye_dragon_inn_2004,you d never think a spacious  mostly empty movie theater could feel so tight  tsai is hugely popular with film critics  i believe  in part because film critics actually have something to do while watching his films  while the girl is limping down the hallway  we can take notes  regular theatergoers  they can only watch helplessly  what really sticks with you is the picture s aura of twilight vibrancy  and the deep pleasure tsai takes in savoring subtle emotions that other filmmakers might not even register  this feels like short film material stretched exasperatingly thin but nonetheless casts a certain sad spell  graced by moments of droll observational humor  
496,being_julia,the little drama queen who lives inside each of us will find being julia hard to resist  just because it s meringue does not mean that there are not genuine pleasures to be found in this light comedy  an intelligently witty comedy that boasts the sort of performance from annette bening that had wags predicting an academy award nomination months ago  may lack originality but makes up for it in sheer bravado and really nice clothes  
497,1135882-uncovered_the_war_on_iraq,provides compelling arguments that even those on the right wing of the political spectrum will be hard pressed to entirely refute  after listening to this steady anti bush drumbeat for the past several months  even the most devout progressives may start to feel as if they ve heard much of this sermon a hundred times before  
498,bon_voyage_2004,this genre of all star comedy adventure romance has traditionally gone down well in france and bon voyage has a really opulent professionalism  a merry sweep  if you like to read subtitles or comprehend french and the beautiful people who speak it  bon voyage is a perfectly delightful time killer at the movies  handsomely staged  ingeniously plotted and played with evident enjoyment  this is mainstream arthouse at its most entertaining  charms with its insouciant attitude toward the impending calamity surrounding the characters  but its froth may wear thin for some viewers  a sophisticated farce about an unlikely subject  a strong diva whore portrayal by isabelle adjani and fine sense of time and place give voyage just enough grounding to make it worth the trip  despite the film s undeniable virtues  i can t help wishing there were something more substantial there than an old fashioned and admittedly engaging yarn  it s persuasively performed by a potent ensemble and artfully directed by jean paul rappeneau  it melds lush period visuals  winning acting and the presence of some true screen legends into an engagingly watchable film  so equally light headed and light footed you expect it to shift into musical mode at any moment  hello  vichy  a genre piece full of great actors and fabulous scenery  a rousing  full blooded entertainment that uses serious themes and events mostly for pure pleasure  what s funny when the nazis are coming to town  not everything  but these guys assume otherwise  
499,girl_with_a_pearl_earring,older teens and adults will enjoy  book is better  the film s scenarios may be unsurprising  but webber s solemn evocation of art in a grey world gives his story an apt  unspoken gravity  as a former editor  we might expect webber to have a better sense of when to cut  but his instincts fail him completely here  working from an intelligent  understated screenplay by olivia hetreed  director peter webber  an acclaimed documentarian  proceeds with a stunning assurance  lavish attention to historical detail  the thorough immersion in this unusual world and johansson s impressive performance make girl with a pearl earring memorable but not a masterpiece  the film s real pleasures are subterranean  hidden in fleeting glances and demurely loaded body language  vermeer s great gift as an artist was to imbue ordinary life with a sense of mystery  alas poor webber  the immaculate consummation witnessed here idles in a middlebrow limbo  neither earthy nor divine  a virtual ricochet fest of eyeball action  those looks  those glares  those gapes  those gawks  a rare and elegant film bathed in the kind of soft  delicate light that can build unexpectedly to feelings of both anxiety and bliss  the picture is simply ravishing  but at times it falls prey to its own contemplations  girl with a pearl earring is one of those quiet  restrained films that softly haunts the viewer for weeks afterward  it won t knock you over  but it won t soon leave you either  beautifully lit  designed and photographed  it is  like much of the dutch master s work  more to be admired than emotionally embraced  to earn its props  a period film must resonate in our time  a movie about art doubles that demand  webber has delivered the goods and then some  we re left wishing for more insight into the people and less into the process  
500,murderball,wheels us through an emotional obstacle course so rigorous and satisfying you ll be gulping for air by the end  i don t know whether directors henry alex rubin and dan adam shapiro set out to show the jock mentality with such clarity  but that s precisely what their gripping movie does  
501,wallace_and_gromit_curse_of_the_wererabbit,the finished article is so cgi like that you wonder whether all that organic stop frame stuff was necessary  sorry  chaps  the comedy is never indulged at the expense of the plot  which flies off in genuinely unexpected directions  culminating in a boundlessly inventive funfair chase sequence  the family comedy is an all around winner  blowing every other animated picture this year so far out of the water they re all stuck somewhere up in the upper atmosphere unable to get back down  despite its vocal distractions  this clay animation comedy adventure managed to dazzle me with its sheer audacity and inventiveness  this might be plasticine s finest hour  in nick park  britain has its own authentic animation genius  there is something for everybody here  an unholy mixture of philip larkin and bruce wayne  it s slightly amusing and i d say when it comes out on video or if you catch it on cable  but to rush out to theaters    don t even try to figure out how park can move plasticine figures around and achieve visual and slapstick miracles  just enjoy  with its sneaky wit and layered jokes  wallace and gromit makes even the big studios  most high tech efforts feel flat  a silly and cuddly dab of silly putty animation from the folks who gave us chicken run but who made their reputations doing short films about a daft englishman and his dog  
502,1152019-good_night_and_good_luck,manages a successful merger between gripping entertainment and understated cautionary tale  rarely moving a facial muscle except to exhale smoke and brimstone  strathairn wonderfully recaptures murrow s deadpan delivery style  clooney continues to improve as both a writer and director  showing huge advancement from his underwhelming 2002 helming debut confessions of a dangerous mind

504,march_of_the_penguins,to human observers  the ways in which animal behavior variously resembles or contrasts with human behavior is an inexhaustible source of fascination  
505,wild_parrots_of_telegraph_hill,irving captures some memorable images  but generally relies on the birds  natural photogenic charm as well as the human dimensions of the drama to sustain the 83 minute film  the beautiful shots of san francisco s lush telegraph hill are captivating by themselves  but the film s greatest achievement is its humanity  a bright window into the wild kingdom just outside our door that most of us barely notice  if at all  charming  intelligent entertainment that should attract the same family audiences that flocked to winged migration in 2001  what might have been a static portrait has become a true story  with tragic turns  joyful surprises and provocative glimpses into the meaning of life  turns out to be that rarity  a movie that makes its audience happier for having seen it  not that san francisco needs more tourists  but wild parrots captures a nice little piece of the city s magic  its landmarks  hills  tree lined streets and quietly regal neighborhoods  
506,kung_fu_hustle,chow is a genius in generating extraordinary drama from the familiar  so disarmingly eager to please that only a stone faced kung fu purist could object  chow s movie may seem nutty on the surface  but its slyness  its dreamy unfolding of so many moods and genres  becomes intoxicating  more like a cartoon populated with human actors  a film where special effects erase physics and the constraints of the human body  there s absolutely no telling what will come next  but for all its stylishness  verve and moments of visual poetry  the relentlessly punishing slapstick and overall cruel tone left me cold  retrieving the martial arts movie from the gentrified middlebrow tastefulness of movies like house of flying daggers is only one item on kung fu hustle s agenda  with hustle s release on 2 000 u s  screens this week  americans get to see what s so funny about chow  the laugh s on them for not noticing him before  broad  low farces with little story and stuffed with epic fights built on plainly impossible  plainly faked gags  they re still a stitch  like a meal prepared by an extreme chef   hustle is more than a bit of a mess  it still tastes like nothing you ve ever had before  lingering on such details is a new development for chow  recalling the style of another aspirant to global pop cinema  sergio leone  given all the hyperbolic kung fu  it s easy to overlook such quietly observant grace notes  
507,squid_and_the_whale,it allows us to feel for all the aggrieved parties  this is no small achievement  considering how badly everyone behaves  
508,harry_potter_and_the_goblet_of_fire,where newell really scores is in taking a leaf out of peter jackson s book and cranking up the fear factor  for those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith  it looks like another handsomely made  good natured and high spirited family movie  which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds  kloves has streamlined j  k  rowling s 700 plus page opus into cinematic fighting form  and the special effects  which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies  are seamlessly integrated  goblet has enough sense of real kids maturing and believably facing problems to cast some genuine spells  never feels anything other than a single thread of a larger narrative  newell handles this unfamiliar material competently enough  but the film never picks up any true momentum  so bloated and joyless that it makes one pine for the bland mediocrity of chris columbus  it emphasizes the emotional development of its characters with dramatic interplay rather than expressionistic  atmospheric gloom  whenever it hits its stride  it s a well acted  vividly executed  full speed ahead special effects extravaganza that puts as much bang as possible into every remaining scene  
509,grizzly_man,of course  the legendary filmmaker can t resist inserting his own outsize ego into the story  but somehow this documentary has room for two larger than life characters  like so much of herzog s work  both narrative and documentary  this is an engrossing look at obsessive behavior gone terribly awry  part punk wildlife doc  part diary of a twisted soul  part cautionary tale  grizzly man is a complex  unique and engrossing journey into the murky recesses of an unhinged mind  at turns fascinating and banal  a film that dances around vital questions about the human condition that it is barely able to articulate  let alone address  he was enough of an amateur to be relaxed and unselfconscious  yet enough of a professional to generate all this outstanding footage  and quite rightly herzog declines to patronise or make fun of him  german auteur werner herzog pieces together the remarkable footage treadwell left behind into a superb portrait of a fractured obsessive living literally on the edge  an alternately gripping and funny charming nature film and psychological study  herzog is still the only person who could have made grizzly man  his admiration for treadwell has its limits  but he understands  better than most directors  what it means to follow dreams into the belly of the beast  a rich  well crafted documentary that offers a rare glimpse at someone who respected mother nature but refused to live by her rules  by fearlessly examining the man warts and all  herzog has fashioned a nature documentary unlike any i ve i think i have ever seen  what makes grizzly man remarkable are the edited tapes that at first seem to show a man at peace among nature  and then later reveal the startlingly fragile state of that man s mind and persona  
510,1151898-capote,hoffman goes beyond impersonation to something close to possession  skillfully and economically put together  this spare  uncompromising portrait not only examines what drove the author but delves into the ethics of journalists who identify with their subjects  or pretend to  in order to report their stories  
511,brokeback_mountain,brokeback mountain is in no rush  its emotional impact builds slowly  its rhythms in tune with the countryside  the rugged grandeur of the mountains  the arid  bleak vistas of backwater western towns  arguably ang lee s best film  this swooning  achingly sad near masterpiece offers a universal love story that lingers long in the mind  a jaundiced portrait of maleness in crisis  extending not only to  the central characters  but also to the validity of manhood as exemplified by every other male character in the film  lee and his collaborators have tapped into proulx s story and gathered it up without missing a single sad  delicate nuance  like all great love stories  ang lee s is one of tragic romance  strongly acted by heath ledger as the most buttoned up of cowboys  and michelle williams as his betrayed and enraged wife  ang lee continues to astonish  don t kid yourself  this is a movie about two gay cowboys  and if you are the type of person who feels you can t handle a subject like this without snickering then you re missing out on one of the best films of 2005  everybody involved in brokeback mountain deserves credit for crafting a film strong enough to withstand all of the third grade snickering that s attended it  a sweeping  solemn  self serious chronicle of their relationship over several decades  it stays with you after you ve seen it  like a haunting strain of music  both love song and elegy for what might have been  the movie has a universal quality because it tells a story of unfulfilled lives and roots it in the well observed specifics of a vanishing western culture  
512,ushpizin,viewers who aren t familiar with orthodox jewish culture might have trouble fully relating to this israeli film  but everyone should be able to appreciate its heartwarming tone  a respectful comedy whose interest for most audiences will be part anthropological  ushpizin walks an interesting line  
513,history_of_violence,there s nothing more off putting than being treated like a guinea pig  
514,travelers_and_magicians,it s a leisurely yet resonant film that reinforces the power of cinematic storytelling  refreshingly quiet and thoughtful  dondup is the make or break role here  and he nails it  a colorful and witty work that doesn t preach so much as gently nudge us to consider the wonders of our existence  with its intricate design  sly humour and timely theme  travellers and magicians is a lot more than just a travelogue  to watch this movie is to be moved not only by an affecting  warmly spirited yarn  but also by the wisdom that seems to waft to us directly from those snow capped peaks  delightful performances are delivered by all in this ingenious work of cinema that is worth seeing if only for its glorious views of the himalayas  a film so enchanting one hates to see it come to an end  a bit too creakingly stiff in its allegory  but the film s refusal to provide simple answers is touchingly appropriate  pic has been adeptly packaged  with every advantage taken to show off the spectacular locations through which the travelers journey  visually accomplished and loads of fun  
515,duma,for those wishing they still made films like the black stallion  today is your lucky day  i can t say enough about that magisterial cheetah  
516,batman_begins,nolan takes an admirable stab at developing a character driven drama  only to give in to generic action movie conventions with a blinding  deafening  explosion laden finale that could have capped off any number of interchangeable jerry bruckheimer flicks  the psychological realism and the science fiction villainy don t always mesh seamlessly  but unlike so many superheroic summer spectacles  this one actually has a soul behind the special effects  if warner brothers hoped that nolan would reanimate the corpse of what should have been their most lucrative franchise  it has got its wish 
517,water,quite possibly the best picture of the year thus far  with no fewer than three of the most luminous female performances i have ever seen onscreen  
518,10005788-the_sun,finds beauty  madness and outright bizarreness in the sight of a lost  slightly freakish man attempting to understand his altering reality  first shown at the berlin film festival four years ago  the sun is finally receiving its welcome american theatrical release  which means that one of the best movies of 2005 is now also one of the best of 2009  though he successfully humanizes hirohito  who is shown happily shedding his divinity  sokurov doesn t entirely exonerate him  while the sun staunchly refuses to pass judgement on a figure considered by many to be a war criminal  it does essay a vivid portrait of the utter experiential vacuum that attends the stupefyingly powerful  the emperor has no clue  the measured direction can feel sluggish as the camera refuses to cut away from lengthy scenes of people getting dressed or filing out of rooms  but ogata s multi layered performance more than compensates  
519,our_brand_is_crisis,this documentary by first time director boynton proves democracy and capitalism are disturbingly intertwined  subject matter dominates over filmmaking craft in rachel boynton s somewhat sloppy but otherwise riveting documentary  insightful if not altogether objective  unlikely as it sounds  a documentary that details with jaw dropping candor how contemporary political campaigning works at the highest levels of government is set not in this country but in the far off reaches of bolivia  political junkies will love this movie  ultimately provides a vivid illustration of the not so hopeful future of international politics  gani is certainly no hero and his american strategists come off as the worst sort of interlopers  boynton maintains a relatively level tone and clear eye and  thus  allows her audience to ask some hard questions about whether our democratic process translates all that clearly in other countries  boynton isn t interested in telling a story  only in the atmosphere of political consultancy  but we already knew this kind of thing happens in american politics  why shouldn t bolivia be entitled to sophisticated polling advice  our brand is crisis  queasy power comes from its understanding of how elections have tangible real world consequences that are measured in deaths and riots as wells as polls and ballots  
520,broken_flowers,the ending is sublime  a set piece that almost makes up for the overwhelming slightness of it all  murray manages  almost impossibly  to come up with still another rich variation on his depleted man persona  and his performance is at once enormously generous and fiercely  concisely witty  there s a real poignancy in watching murray s emotional chill thaw from the heat generated by even the idea of romance  or at least its more libidinous evil twin  lust  brilliantly complex and vivid performances make this film a moving exploration of all we do to find meaning in our lives  exhibits a confident delicacy and palpable  mature sadness  broken flowers manages to charm us with its encompassing fragrance  the pungency of life forces emerging from the muck  jarmusch s touch is magical  the movie a sublime meditation that left me wanting more which  in this case  is actually a very good thing  completely charming  but ultimately slight  it kept me absorbed all the way through  especially the collaboration between acting auteur bill murray and mr  jarmusch in virtually every frame of the film   a simple and blissful melding of sensibilities which may be the year s best film thus far   it takes someone with murray s reservoir of audience goodwill to make such a maddeningly passive character even worth watching  
521,head_on_2005,ultimately more provocative than insightful  a riveting love story that never flinches from the unsettling reality of a specific social issue or the universal joys that two people can bring to each other s lives  no matter how hard they try to bring agony to their own  
522,1167811-ballets_russes,geller and goldfine have assembled a vital historical document  covering a cultural era now mostly lost  corrupted imperceptibly but permanently when fledgling ballerinas started dreaming about broadway and hollywood instead of swan lake  enacts its drama with a light editorial hand and unavoidable sentimentality  
523,king_kong,it takes a while to get everybody to skull island  about 70 minutes  but it s time extremely well spent  despite admirable chest thumping and watts  wonderfully enhanced scream  there is still only one true king  as for kong himself  although the computer has played a large part in his creation  he could never be considered as anything less than real  the interplay between watts  melancholy blond and the great ape is almost too real to be believed  it s touching and heartfelt in a way even modernistic  non effects driven films can t manage  our response to the ape s doom  once touched by authentic tragedy  is now marked by relief that this wretchedly excessive movie is finally over  packed with enough edge of your seat did i just see that goose bumpy popcorn pleasure for a year s worth of blockbusters  somehow jackson s overflowing passion for his favorite film has translated into the most rigorously entertaining and rousing adventure of the entire year  although king kong is spectacular  its power doesn t reside in its glittering vision of 1933 manhattan  jackson s virtuoso flourishes or his computer generated effects  it s so much simpler  when the gorilla touches the girl  he touches our hearts  there are some dazzling moments and remarkably clunky ones  a stitched together mixture of old and new  a genre tour that jumps in tone from jaunty comedy to sci fi horror to laboured social commentary  one of those mad movies  like moulin rouge  or burton s charlie and the chocolate factory  that fully justifies and deserves all the best and worst that can be said for or against them  
524,millions,a subversive fable from one of the uk s most engaging filmmakers  millions sees director danny boyle transform a kiddie movie into a painfully accurate portrait of british consumerism  millions offers a deft mixture of reality and fantasy in unexpected places  a charming cash cow with cute twists to its tale  it s childhood done just right  part cotton candy angels  part gurning adult frighteners  and all wide eyed kidhood bravado  a delightful kids movie done from a kid s perspective that alternates between feeling like a fable and a pop up book  it s cute and touching  who would have thought we d ever use those terms to describe a danny boyle movie  embraces a kid centric perspective without condescending to it  this utterly enchanting british import manages to transport us to other worlds  some of them heavenly  
525,cache_2005,austrian sadist michael haneke s most mainstream film to date is this exquisitely calibrated and jittery thriller  contrarian that he is  haneke does a much finer job forcing questions than providing an answer  haneke s patient  tip toed assault turns cach  from a little movie about spooked haute bourgeois media personalities into a sneaky and effective expos  on the artifice of film  one thing that cannot be argued is haneke s ability to attract the best actors in cinema  perhaps by promising to take them places they have never been  this is a film you will be discussing for days  trying to figure out what actually happened and why  what really makes hidden so involving is haneke s sometimes maddening insistence on keeping things vague  haneke has a deceptively random way with narrative  the scenes don t follow one another in conventional fashion  when cach  played at cannes  some critics deplored its lack of a resolution  i think it works precisely because it leaves us hanging  
526,howls_moving_castle,a floatingly delightful fairytale with its heart set on repealing the law of gravity  miyazaki isn t interested in the jolts of surrealism so much as imbuing his audience with the idea that reality can change at any moment  and change back just as quickly  a strange delight awash in visual splendor  understated humor and clever body and soul transmogrifications among its bonny band of weirdos  a stunning example of a pure  disorienting dream logic that cinema provides all too rarely  the risibly cloying closing scenes are likely to nix any remaining goodwill  blotting out such delicate early touches as a stroll through the air far above a town square  as much of a hand drawn treat as spirited away  chock full of numinous sunsets  fabulous organic machinery and gratuitously delightful touches  youngsters and miyazaki fans will coo at the world s depth and rich surreality  but opaque plotting  and a tendency to mope with sophie whilst howl is off affecting events let the momentum of the first act vanish into thin air  it s not miyazaki s best work  but it is leagues beyond any traditional 2 d animation out of 3 d mad hollywood lately  and more beguiling than anything disney s done in ages  while there s no denying miyazaki s visual flair and tip top draughtsmanship  i found myself less than enchanted by the mile high convolutions of the plot  and frankly bored by the final half hour  
527,up_for_grabs,even if you didn t follow the story then  wranovics tells it so wryly your interest never flags    and there s more suspense for newcomers  since the mystery and court verdict remain in doubt until the end  in the annals of baseball history  their battle will remain a curious little footnote  but sometimes footnotes are more compelling than the main text  this smartly assembled comedy articulates irritation with and bewilderment at its subject  the legal battle for possession of a baseball  it would be hard to find a more succinct and entertaining indictment of american popular culture and obsessive sports fans  it definitely has entertainment value  providing of course that you re able to find amusement in greed  duplicity and expensive litigation  up for grabs may be the perfect sports doc for this me first day and age  a winning combination of humor and crafty filmmaking that cleverly masks the social commentary going on beneath  the film spends a little too much time on the fates of previous home run balls in general  michael wranovics  documentary replays this sorry chapter in all american greed in glorious detail  director michael wranovics does a deft job of keeping things moving  eccentric and nutty  after all  where else  and under what other circumstances  could someone say  he caught it  about popov in a singles bar and have women flock around him  the tone is best captured by one bay area sportswriter s wry comment that catching a valuable home run ball is  sort of like winning the lottery except you feel like you earned it   with complex lead characters  an endless supporting cast and focus on an inanimate object that draws out the weakness in men  the movie has more in common with the lord of the rings trilogies than anything from the camera of ken burns

530,1153077-1153077-pride_and_prejudice,breathes new life into characters and conversations never before quite wholly free from the printed page  as bubbly and joyful as any movie you re likely to find at your local multiplex for some time  
531,tristram_shandy_a_cock_and_bull_story,coogan may be game and there are plenty of nods to assorted sexploits  but this riffing on his caddish public image was done a lot more amusingly and a lot less smugly in a 10 minute skit in jim jarmusch s coffee and cigarettes  a wildly imaginative foray into spirited comic anarchy  
532,paradise_now,with inspired judgment and skill  the film embeds its debating points in the trajectory of the story  or humanises them with everyday emotions  the film continues to twist and turn until the very end  keeping us guessing as to what the would be martyrs will do  the film offers food for thought  and reminds us that  in any war  one who understands the mindset of his opponent gains an important tactical advantage  certainly what said says will not come as a surprise to any israeli  it s simply that they disagree  we may disagree  too  and yet watch the film with a fearsome fascination  a risk taking but enlightening film that takes the novel approach of examining the israeli arab impasse from the perspective of the palestinians  very good  viewers of all persuasions can find a human perspective on an aspect of terrorism that  no matter how often it occurs  is beyond imagining for most of us  it would be difficult to undertake a more politically relevant film or explore a more volatile subject  and abu assad attempts his project with skill and sensitivity  a movie hardly lacking for anxiety and uneasiness  writer director hany abu assad can t tell the entire story in paradise now  but he can show glimmers of it  the movie is driven by the characters  passionate  despairing arguments about the fine line between victimization and violence  but paradise now also has  at times  an almost surreal visual flair  asks the big questions and answers quite a few of them  although its ending is tantalizingly ambiguous  with a documentarian s eye and a dramatist s urgency  abu assad sneaks into the mind of a suicide bomber  and also his heart  it s too simply reasoned and too tidily made to shake you up  
533,40_year_old_virgin,if it were 20 minutes shorter  it would be that much closer to perfect  the script is little more than an excuse for letting a bouncy team of sketch comics have their heads  unlike most films pasted together in this way  it displays a certain cohesion  at its best it resembles one of those classic early  80s comedies starring steve martin    the thinking man s woody allen    boasting an acute mix of desperation  dignity  lunacy and indecorous wit  on the surface nothing more than a national lampoon style raunch fest  this  highly  adult sex romp is unexpectedly sweet and full of heart  it s also laugh out loud funny and the only picture this year where i performed a bona fide spit take  apatow genuinely loves his hero  and the film s innate sweetness carries it through the rough patches of a funny comedy with a central relationship that isn t particularly funny  count me among the naysayers  overlong and slightly muddled  this is nevertheless an enjoyable showcase for the superb steve carell  a ribald  risqu  yet surprisingly warm hearted vehicle for steve carell  steve carell plays the title character in a charmingly bent comedy about a likable geek s progress from action figures to real action  hilarious and imaginatively crude with a surprising sweet and subtle aftertaste that prevents it from flopping  limp and brainless  into the sugary abyss of romantic predictability  the whole film is about embarrassment  about those moments of clammy vulnerability when the world just turns and stares  
534,1159353-darwins_nightmare,the movie prefers to show snippets of life and let the audience make the connections  many of these scenes prove memorable  if sauper is fired up by anti globalist conviction  his instincts as an artist and as a man rule out any kind of rhetoric or cheapness  it immerses you in its reality one toe at a time  until suddenly you are in over your head  gasping for air as the horror of the situation reveals itself in all its savage devastation  this  sauper s film says without words  is what the human race has evolved into    the developed world preying on the undeveloped to the extent that people suffer and die so that two million fillets a day are available to euro diners  becomes errol morris s bad dream    a documentary apparently uninterested in any factual basis for its arguments  an uncompromising portrait of how global capitalism can exploit an area s resources to the point of near annihilation  with a roving eye and an attentive heart  sauper s film takes in everyone involved in this miasma  the documentary tries to pin africa s suffering on capitalism  but dances around the real problem  it illuminates the sinister logic of a new world order that depends on corrupt globalization to put an acceptable face on age old colonialism  
535,new_york_doll,the late johnny thunders didn t write you can t put your arms around a memory until after the dolls had broken up  but this lovely little heartbreaker of a movie takes the sentiment as its own  the film paints an affectionate portrait of a wry  somewhat addled man whose hard partying past was in stark contrast with his later life    a fluffy cat nestles in his guitar case while he explains his nickname  surely there have been filmmakers who knew less about music going into their first music documentary than greg whiteley  but none springs to mind  poves that mormonism and makeup adorned punk rock aren t oil and water entities

537,charlie_and_the_chocolate_factory,witty  wonderful and wildly imaginative  burton s first proper  family movie  since pee wee s big adventure delivers a sugar rush that ll last for days  i wonder if even children will respond to the peculiarly humorless and charmless stylistic eccentricities of mr  burton and his star  johnny depp  an intoxicating endorphin rush  you can t help feeling that a fantasist as accomplished as burton can manage this kind of project with his eyes shut  the trouble is that  from film to film  his dreams are starting to look the same  pure magic  in its best sections  it s magically deranged in a way no other filmmaker could even come close to pulling off  throughout his fey  simpering performance  depp seems to be straining so hard for weirdness that the entire enterprise begins to feel like those excruciating occasions when your parents tried to be hip  the summer s most visually arresting escapist adventure  opulently entertaining  
538,star_wars_episode_iii_revenge_of_the_sith,say what you want about lucas  one take directing style  his over reliance on blue screens or his cheesy tendency to reference himself  but his imagination is as fertile as ever  the best looking star wars episode of all  if not the most exciting  most imaginative or most affecting  lucas is a brilliant technician but a poor philosopher  and his lurchingly thought out rendering of futuristic politics prevents the entire series from achieving the greatness to which it aspires  the final third of this dark  brooding epic is utterly mesmerizing  building magnificently to a coda setting up all the events in the original trilogy with an as to now  at least in the prequels  unforeseen brilliance although the stiff theatrics are part of the design  they re no longer excusable  not far into the first third of the movie  i didn t think i was going to make it all the way through the percussive nonstop action  nominally better than its immediate predecessors thanks to a pervasive atmosphere of catastrophic doom  lucas has woven into the action and effects a relatively thoughtful story about a young man meant for greatness but corrupted by his own fear and confusion  a story more shakespearean than arthurian  
539,corpse_bride,more so  other than being an astonishing feast for the eyes there isn t much here a person is likely to remember after they ve left the theater  none of the jokes or sight gags good enough to talk about latter standing at the water cooler  
540,constant_gardener,fernando meirelles  codirector of city of god  stresses old fashioned storytelling and takes full advantage of his cast  including danny huston  while le carre s narrative returns an unequivocal guilty verdict on the drug companies  the jury on meirelles s storytelling abilities remains hung  serious  topical filmmaking of a very high order  fiennes and weisz  who have worked together before in istvan szabo s sunshine  make a glamorous pair  and while this may not have been the effect le carre was after  it does no lasting damage to his theme  there is a terrific pulse of energy in this film  a voltage which drives it over two hours  this haunting film will linger with you as a portrait of love lost and found  fiennes carries le carr s spirit with a slow burning performance that operates on two fronts  as a powerful indictment of third world abuses by pharmaceutical companies  and as a widower s moving investigation into his shattered relationship  fiennes does more with silence than almost any actor i ve ever seen  an early scene where he learns of his wife s death is stunning  the emotions passing through him as he slowly waters the plants in his office as multifaceted and profound    rises to a pitch of terror and outrage that leaves one shaken  the director s fluttering hand keeps the ground constantly shifting beneath our feet  which is just what this beautifully wrenching adaptation for the screen requires  an intriguing thriller for grown ups  the constant gardener manages to fight through its own pretensions to deliver a tale you care about  featuring characters you care for  
541,junebug,delicately avoids hollywood s typical condescending caricatures of those who dwell below the mason dixon line  the adult tensions and the tone take us to a place remembered so vividly that even if we don t know this corner of the south  we ve somehow lived there or at least passed through  as someone with southern roots  i can tell you i personally know every character in this movie  i am especially knowledgeable of george  a man who knew he had to leave but knows part of him never can  
542,tony_takitani,ichikawa evokes the heady and suffocating effect of the past playing irrevocable catch up with itself  a gentle breeze of absurdism floats through this lyrically understated story  its sadness is little short of magical  this gossamer work is one of the loveliest examples of minimalist cinema i ve seen in a long time  a quietly simple fable that hits you hardest after it s over  the camera effortlessly glides from scene to scene  revealing faultlessly framed shots that consist mostly of just one or two people  their backs often to the camera  
543,the-heart-of-the-game, the film  covers seven years and touches on some of the same social issues that gave hoop dreams its epic sweep  yet serrill fails to treat any of them adequately  and the narrative loses its shape as events unfold  the intrusive narration  from hip hopper chris  ludacris  bridges  offers little sense of real lives unfolding  more of a way being paved to an  admittedly tense  all american triumph over adversity climax  boredom and irritation set in early with this shallow  parochial and blandly celebratory documentary about a us high school girls  basketball team  of frankly limited interest to non us audiences  it s packed with left field twists and turns and culminates in a genuinely nail biting match where old rivalries come to a head  in the end  it s all you can do not to stand up and cheer  it shifts focus too often to hang together as an in depth portrait of either the unconventional coach or his headstrong star player  darnellia is an inspiring and engaging heroine  and her story speaks volumes about the marginalization of women s athletics  it s almost impossible to refrain from cheering as if you were right there in the stands  its squeak and sweat athleticism  its tough  bruised  big hearted players and its electrifying championship countdowns should appeal to anyone who loves the game  anybody who doesn t find themselves on the edge of their seat for this film s final minutes shouldn t be going to movies  serrill  making his feature debut  didn t plan on spending seven years with the roughriders  but reality just kept getting more compelling and complicated  and his persistence paid off  this is a movie about empowerment  integrity and having fun  and those are always in season  
544,look_at_me,this is the kind of fluid  balanced comedy drama that woody allen wishes he could still make  the characters exude moral three dimensionality  they re not built to behave or please us  they re not bound by that inflexible hollywood contract to modify their lives and morals just in time for the ending  it s a marvel that reverberates long after we leave the theater  
545,turtles_can_fly,despite its fanciful title  turtles can fly leads viewers into a slough of despond  one in which not just hope is strangled but virtually any possibility for simple human kindness  relentless  bleakly funny  thoroughly remarkable drama you ll see more accomplished films  but you won t see many that have more heartbreaking impact  as beautifully shot  by cinematographer shahriar assadi  as it is sensitively written and directed and wonderfully acted  
546,2046,the ravishing images are tinged with regret and loss  no passion can assuage the jaded hero s solitude  the romantic fatalism is so lush that you re invited to get lost in it  quite simply an incomparably sublime work of art  a triumph of lyricism over narrative in the cinema  and the most exquisite homage to the beauty of women it has ever been my privilege to witness on the screen  a languid  shimmering mood piece from a master stylist  with some of asia s finest actors at their peak  wong offers an artful meditation on the nature of love  making effective use of color schemes  yellows  greens and reds   placid shotmaking and diverse music to deliver a sultry portrait of postwar hong kong  as someone who admires wong s ambition and skill  i m able to give 2046 only a halfhearted recommendation  in a film that likes teasing mysteries  the greatest revelation is ziyi zhang  it s like a sketchbook  these are images  tones  dialogue and characters that wong is sure of  and he practices them  but he does not seem very sure why he is making the movie  or where it should end  at its best  it drenches the screen with sensuous poetry and touches a core of sadness  think of it as a visual tone poem about longing and loss  a journey through a vale of luminously beautiful tears  2046 isn t entirely successful  it s very high concept and can be difficult to follow  but when it was over  i immediately wanted to watch it again  
547,tell_them_who_you_are,a desperately sad look at two men whose determination to rebel against their heritage and succeed in their artform has rendered them unable to communicate  compelling stuff  though  as personally troublesome as they may be  the prickly dynamics keep the docu bobbing along  
548,walk_the_line,not only does the film show just how hungry cash was to sing his songs  it understands how hungry society was for the cataclysmic changes such music brought   a n old fashioned c w standard  coming just a year after taylor hackford s ray  comparisons between this and that oscar winning jamie foxx biopic are inevitable  on most levels  those comparisons are unfair  
549,proposition,any movie that can cling to your memory with as much brutal power as this fantastic film is unquestionably a proposition worth taking  it doesn t offer much that hasn t already been said about lawless frontier towns  bonds between outlaws or the settling of the west  by the end  it all pays off exactly the way a hundred earlier westerns did  an intense piece of wilderness ugliness that mixes family  honor  decency  revenge  racism and mindless blood lust in a manner that satisfies even if it never astounds  the squeamish should skip this film  but its recurring violence seems justified in terms of the story cave sets out to tell and is up a familiar alley for the songwriter who has an album called murder ballads  murder ballad for the slice and dice age  a film of sensitive artistry laced with gore  this is the crucial proposition the proposition misses  to make us truly despair about the face of violence  it must be firmly attached to someone we know  and not merely blown off someone we don t  a near masterpiece of mood and menace  and one that deserves to be seen on the largest screen possible  it s consistently compelling and thought provoking  this one will stay with you  and despite its disturbing moments  you ll welcome it  offering proportionate measures of raw violence and lyrical soliloquizing  the peckinpah influenced the proposition is for those who prefer their western action unvarnished but immaculately framed  a pitiless yet elegiac australian western as caked with beauty as it is with blood  i m guessing that hillcoat wants us to see the proposition as a howling  heartsick message from our savage selves  the story is ugly  but there s some beauty in the telling  
550,shake_hands_with_the_devil_the_journey_of_romeo_dallaire,a flat lined  pedestrian affair  a talking heads  touring heads piece that seems to point the camera in the wrong direction  a personalized  historically charged travelogue that speaks to a massive tragedy s impact on one man  we never get a satisfying re creation of the events for which dallaire now suffers  offers a rare and privileged portrait of a heroic man profoundly troubled by a terrible experience  poses an essential question  how can you shame an international community that  even now  seems constitutionally incapable of it  raymont s film  with dallaire as the main voice and news footage from 1994  lays out a compelling  compact story  the filmmakers follow this compassionate and articulate man as returns to rwanda a decade later to revisit his demons  a fascinating account of its subject s self torture over his inability to stop one of the 20th century s greatest tragedies  this wonderful  devastating documentary is as much dallaire s story as it is the story of a whole continent abandoned by a cynical world  his story is worth telling  and worth remembering for what it tells us about the west s brutal disinterest in africa  and the united nations  inability to do even its most basic job of keeping the peace  dellaire s final bit of self abuse is to blame himself for his failure to shame the world to action  romeo dallaire seems to be the only human in the world with a conscience  that it s eating him alive makes shake hands required viewing  perhaps even at the un  shake hands is less about one man than about a u n  structurally incapable of carrying out its peacekeeping mandate  then and now  it gives us a man who could have stopped the carnage    800 000 murdered in 100 days    but whose hands were bound at the highest level  he knows this  it haunts him  and if it doesn t shame you  it should  extols the power of truth over fiction

552,saving_face,abjectly collapses into feel good nonsense  
553,rois_et_reine,while these characters  lives are melodramatic  individual scenes burst with kinetic energy from fast editing and an script that deftly underscores the destructive nature of male female relationships  
554,mysterious_skin,gordon levitt s performance is nothing short of astonishing  gone is the gloomy nihilism of the doom generation and the living end  replaced by a melancholy  but hopeful  affection toward people with the capacity to overcome tremendous psychological trauma  the audience has gotten the point roughly 90 minutes before the characters do  manages to deal with its raw  awful subject matter in ways that are both challenging and illuminating  filmmaker gregg araki  heretofore best known for his numerous ragged and nihilistic coming of age  gay melodramas  here crosses over from the fringes to make his most mature and penetrating drama to date  while watching this movie  i scribbled the word  whoa  five times into my notebook  there is a terrible  terrifying honesty at the core of mysterious skin that will make it chillingly recognizable to some viewers and important to recognize for others  by the time the climactic revelation finally comes  it s such old news that all the scenery chewing that accompanies it seems alien  of all the recent films about child abuse  mysterious skin stands out as the one that most directly and eloquently addresses the emotional toll of the experience  you re likely to be bruised by its truths  to his credit  araki has made that a risk well worth taking  it s a film that deals with childhood sexual abuse in an original and dry eyed manner rarely seen in our culture today  
555,serenity,joss whedon makes a rousing feature directing debut  exploiting the cult status of his short lived series firefly to continue it on the big screen  has a simultaneously sprawling yet intimate quality  evinces the kind of swashbuckling bonhomie that made so many of us fall in love with the original star wars films  a love that was mightily tested by george lucas  humorless prequels  half a millennium after neil armstrong s one small step for mankind and we re back in the saddle again  fans get priority seating on the ride  but there s plenty of room for rookies to clamber aboard  this genre picture is still a thrillingly original science fiction creation  it would make a cute tv show  serenity is so like tv that it ought to come with a clicker so we can switch over to the next movie at the multiplex  as always  whedon s sci fi fantasies smartly parallel the serious issues we re grappling with here on earth  while his protagonists remain mordantly funny in the face of utter disaster  a lot more sweaty fun than the last three overhyped  sterile  for dorks only star wars cartoons  whedon knows that he s blazing down a well worn trail  but he addresses that by deftly adding elements of humor  action  romance and horror and continually confounding audience expectations  
556,ongbak,an effective martial arts film destined to leave mouths agape  this nearly six minute sequence is one of the most joyously rapturous of the new year  the actor sliding under vehicles  walking pixie like across a minefield of heads and leaping over knives  fences and even cars with unmitigated glee  i wouldn t bet against a kickboxer who sets himself on fire and then crushes an opponent between his flaming fibulas  imaginatively plotted destruction abounds  
557,gunner_palace,gunner palace isn t a particularly violent movie   but every moment is fraught with the potential for violence  you certainly can t question tucker s bravery  but you may occasionally feel the urge to ask him to be quiet  while gunner palace has the immediacy of street rap  it is actually a throwback to the cinema verite style of pioneering documentarians d a  pennebaker  albert maysles and frederick wiseman  but they re very good at documenting the tedium of the place and the work  the banal dangers of an occupation where the enemy could be anyone  the film s strength    and its weakness    is in its you are there view of guys who are e mailing their loved ones back home one minute and breaking down the doors of iraqi homes the next  on the hunt for the enemy  reminds you that the thousands of faceless  nameless troops in iraq are still there after you switch off cnn  a doc that doesn t quite live up to its premise but still manages to go beyond packaged news and into the often surreal days and nights of soldiers in a strange  modern war  jammed with information and serious testimony  giving a detailed and textured account of what it s like to be fighting the war more than a year after victory was declared  this film is so valuable  not because it argues a position about the war and occupation  but because it simply goes and observes as soldiers work and play  talk and write letters home and  on a daily basis  risk their lives in sudden bursts of violence  one of the most frightening aspects of the movie is the random feeling it conveys  another is the shock of seeing such very young soldiers  many of them teenagers  caught up in a war they don t really understand  we don t get to know the soldiers as individuals well enough  invaluable if incomplete  director michael tucker has accomplished something difficult  making a casual though often intense film in the midst of a war zone  suggests the primacy of movies in shaping both the reality that led these soldiers to enlist and the one they found in iraq when they got there  
558,mad_hot_ballroom,charming if slightly overlong  
559,cinderella_man,the fight scenes have a stinging authenticity and  although at 144 minutes it outstays its welcome  this is howard s best film since apollo 13 the best actor oscar race starts now  a superficially rousing portrait of depression era legend james j  braddock  crowe is at his best in the ring and while it s hardly surprising that he s a convincing bruiser  he also manages to make a rather one note character compelling  ron howard and russell crowe have once again combined their efforts to create a big hollywood biopic that exudes the strong whiff of oscar bait  howard unleashes one of his best directorial jobs to date  refusing to slobber on either syrup or sentimentality as the picture progresses  everything here feels honest and genuine  the movie lived in to the point of having to pay rent  this is an utterly predictable  thoroughly manipulative and thunderously obvious movie  i wouldn t change a frame of it  cinderella man bids for audience approval at every turn  we re in an almost irony free zone  where everything is exactly as it seems  and no subtexts are available for subtext fanatics  ron howard s depression era ode to second chances and noble contests  filmed here last summer  is not just another boxing movie or just another picture  it s a completely absorbing and artfully made fairy tale that just so happens to be true  
560,hustle_and_flow,follows the traditional hollywood rags to riches tale but throws in unexpected grit and top class drama  like scorsese scouring the streets of new york  brewer is so confident  so at ease amidst the crazily calm and lackadaisical whimsy of memphis  seedier pathways i almost felt like i was there  brewster s script relies on more coincidence and happenstance than a dickens novel and yet adoring critics will likely rave about its grit and authenticity  
561,moustache,what the movie lacks visually  it makes up for with the performances  especially by lindon  who leads us on a journey we want to stick with even if we can t fully understand  an absorbing riddle posed in cool  matter of fact tones  i found it mesmerizing from beginning to end  leaps from a gripping identity thriller into a strange yet equally involving adventure about the bounds of self knowledge and the incredible liberty of disregarding them  spins an agitated mystery well beyond its minimalist starting point  offering up giant questions about sanity and identity on its trip from the bathroom mirror  what does it all mean  we are never quite sure  all we learn from this relentless saga of mental and physical solitude are the many varieties of suffering one can endure when one feels alone in the universe  this narrative feature debut by emmanuel carrere  based on his own novel  is deliberately open ended  but however one interprets the outcome  the film reminds us how fragile intimacy is  la moustache dissolves into a meandering annoyance that takes us from paris to hong kong and back again  a successful novelist and restrained actor s director  carr re makes the transformation of a silly marital argument into a cosmic upheaval look easy  and profound as well  the film is an unpretentious blank slate  almost totally without point but so unassuming it earns consideration  at its most stimulating  moustache is a keen glimpse into a marriage that appears perfect on the surface but when examined shows its deficiencies  
562,1153719-syrian_bride,reps generous hearted ensemble storytelling  
563,rize,it s an incomplete film  we don t get to know these kids well enough  
564,worlds_fastest_indian,there also are plenty of nuts and bolts references to satisfy those interested in racing  whether on two wheels or four  the movie features some funny moments  such as when munro makes his own pistons and then brews tea from the cooling barrel water  
565,the_perfect_crime_2005,a story that begins as farce but that evolves into something approaching satirical profundity  my advice is to choose the first half  where things are really funny until they aren t  an outrageous comedy of errors set at a madrid department store  an astute satire on the boundlessness of unchecked sexual fetishism and power  while not boring  it is too light to be taken seriously  el crimen perfecto loses some steam in the final quarter  but still has enough style to make you want to see how it all shakes out  there are lots of wicked laughs here  if nothing tremendously original  packs laughs  over the top plot twists and even a socially conscious message or two into a twisted story about the ruthless competition between a couple of would be managers in a sprawling department store  writer director lex de la iglesia has made it clear that all rules are off and all our expectations are moot  not satisfied merely to follow his premise out the window  he s going to drag it up to the 50th floor  first  so much of el crimen perfecto sustains such a dazzlingly vital pitch it makes the typical american studio attempt at far out black comedy look pretty far in  and pretty pale  there s not enough good material to fill the film s overlong 105 minutes  
566,three_times,this is a fascinating exercise in utilising style to make subtle psychological and political statements  hsiao hsien reinforces his excellent cinematography with a bold use of music  featuring the platters  smoke gets in your eyes  but ultimately the running time could have been halved and he would still have made his point  three varieties of love  unfulfilled  mercenary  meaningless  all photographed with such visual beauty that watching the movie is like holding your breath so the butterfly won t stir  great cinema  pop romance that carries a special charge  the deceptive simplicity of these vignettes  written by chu tien wen  throws into relief hou s formidable storytelling strengths and visual acuity    his way with actors  his subtlety and expressiveness  do hou s films deserve to be seen  absolutely  if only to end the myth that they re too perfect for this world  according to one american critic  three times is  why cinema exists   only if you think that cinema has no higher calling that presenting a long series of gorgeously lit closeups of beautiful actresses are you likely to agree  for the uninitiated  three times presents an ideal primer  a condensed k tel collection of themes that have consistently reappeared throughout hou hsiao hsien s career  a trilogy of desire from the taiwanese director hou hsiao hsien in which the same actress and actor play variations on lovers in three distinct historical periods  while it s impossible to deny that the film is interesting and unique  it s not the kind of motion picture that will cause the average viewer to run out and urge his friends to make a trip to one of the obscure art houses where it s playing  is there another filmmaker who can so fluidly celebrate the moment as well as the epoch  and do so in the same shot  
567,oldboy,a visually beguiling trip that keeps pulling you along and keeps you wondering what fresh hell could possibly come next  
568,sin_city,this extremely violent movie is not for kids  if raymond chandler and daffy duck could have produced a child  sin city would be their baby  it s all so sudden and in your face you can almost feel the thunderous thw aaaack  of a sucker punch ram full throttle into your jaw  its creators invent a queasily intoxicating new world  time was when movie makers  even laws unto  themselves such as sam peckinpah  could be trusted to examine the consequences of living every moment in mortal danger  violence meant something more to them than simple connoisseurship  the look of it remains exceptional  a high contrast monochrome showcase of sheeting rain  shattering glass and white on black silhouettes  with occasional motifs picked out in vivid colour   a  fiercely original crime anthology that hits right between the eyes with a striking blend of old school noir and newfangled comicbook visuals  can bring more pain than satisfaction  robert rodriguez is one audaciously talented man  for those who enjoy their tough guy testosterone straight up  no chaser  it s a 120 proof sucker punch to the cinematic solar plexus  the movie feels like a reductive exercise  rodriguez might have accomplished what he set out to do  but i m not sure he s done anyone any favors  two hours and six minutes has never seemed so much like two and six tenths seconds  it s pure pulp metafiction  
569,inside_deep_throat,bailey and barbato can only scratch the boogie nights influenced surface  but they cover the abcs of pornography with undeniable zip  fascinating social criticism and a witty and relevant take on american sexual history  the absorption of deep throat into the political melodrama that was watergate seems to have led to some grandiose statements in messrs  bailey and barbato s documentary  it just doesn t go deep enough  deep throat bore an x certificate  inside deep throat is an nc 17  neither is suitable for grownups  although the film starts out with a clear thesis  by the time its 90 minute running length has expired  it is grasping at themes and topics that are beyond the limited scope of what a superficial documentary can achieve  might be more entertaining than instructive  but it manages to return us to a time when the world seemed crazy in a different sort of way  the movie will set off a slew of new questions  bailey and barbato aren t interested in classic documentary filmmaking  they re trendy dabblers in waste management  picking through the pop culture trash to see what they can recycle for kitsch value  it s a good blueprint for people who don t know about the movie and what a huge impact it had  it doesn t do much more than that  
570,me_and_you_and_everyone_we_know, me and you  has a refreshingly unhysterical  but sometimes hysterically funny  take on what it s like for kids to grow up in a world of internet sex  broken families and precocious sexual curiosity  click with it and there are elements to enjoy  but the title suggests a universal significance the film can t supply  these characters are sympathetic  july is without a doubt a brave new talent in the creatively beleaguered world of american cinema  performance artist miranda july has long trafficked in short pieces  and it shows  her feature length debut is packed with arresting images  moments  and single lines of dialogue  it s a sturdy piece of writing wed to an utterly unique visual style  a film of indescribable and often unmentionable charm  me and you and everyone we know is one of those completely unexpected artistic experiences  a work from an unknown with such a compelling  unique perspective that it boggles and inspires  first time feature director july s success has a great deal to do with her bold embrace of childhood and its gnarly truths  director miranda july just might be the year s most exciting film discovery  one leaves the theater grateful to have shared the time with these characters on screen  but hoping we won t meet them in the lobby  the debut film from performance art crossover miranda july delivers an unlikely blend of irreverence and optimism  for all its dark humor and fringe qualities  the movie never descends into easy misanthropy  generally maintains a lovely humanism  
571,de_zaak_alzheimer,a jaw dropping premise so smartly executed that if this movie weren t in flemish i d swear that michael mann had directed it  though memory works perfectly well as a policier  it works even better as a character study of a man losing his edge  the film won t put you at the edge of your seat  but will keep your attention  this belgian film has the sheen of polished hollywood product  amplified by continental elegance and depth  decleir s tough guy vulnerability  which brings to mind such classic screen heavies as lee j  cobb and richard widmark  gives an otherwise standard police procedural extraordinary grace and power  we shouldn t commiserate with an assassin  but part of the movie s skill is in making us share angelo s dread at what s happening to him  an entertaining new crime procedural from belgium  in a summer that hasn t seen many good foreign films  the memory of a killer is one worth seeking out  overall i found the film a puzzling mixture of convincing local atmospherics and pretentious imported grandeur  writer director erik van looy keeps the action moving briskly  this is one terrific thriller with several wicked tricks up its sleeve  each more satisfying than the last

573,1149496-1149496-red_eye,not the most sophisticated psychological thriller  yet slick fun deftly handled by craven and his leads  sure  it isn t the most original cookie in the jar  but that doesn t make it any less tasty  this slick b movie thrill ride breaking out as one of the summer s most white knuckled surprises  the movie turns into a complicated duel that depends on precise observation of physical detail and moment by moment continuity so closely calibrated that it s impossible to find a wasted shot or an exaggerated emotion  a classy thriller that scoots along at breakneck speed  for wes craven  who i like a lot as a slasher director  he really goes into a different direction with this  after a summer of crashes  bangs  endless chase scenes and special effects that belittle the actors standing in front of them  what a pleasure to see characters in a thriller doing what people like themselves possibly could do  a perfect grace note to an exceptionally action packed summer movie season  given that red eye runs less than 80 minutes without credits  the utter failure of its final act is damning  fast and furious and tightly focused and blessedly short at 85 minutes  it recalls not so much today s bloated  computer crazed films  but tighter melodramas of the  50s   craven finds  another new way to stoke our apprehensions of being caught vulnerable and helpless  teach this one in film schools  maybe it could save us from all those stupid  nobody would do that plot turns  flaccid formula screenwriting and thrillers that run so long they lose their thrills  
574,beyond_the_gates,though less reassuring and not as dramatically coherent as hotel rwanda  it still packs a hard punch  the film grinds inexorably toward its unsurprising and terrible conclusion with infinite grace but no real suspense  the sight of one character  a pleasant soul full of love and a lust for life i couldn t help but admire  suddenly brandishing a machete  his leg covered in blood and wearing a friendly smile made ice water run straight through my veins  movies about africa often fall into this trap  righteous indignation is the exclusive province of non africans  by keeping most of the action contained to the school grounds and immediate environs  director michael caton jones creates a claustrophobic atmosphere where fear can fester  if its scenes of tribal violence feel overly familiar to viewers of 2004 s hotel rwanda  its account of desperate choices made in the throes of terror remains emotionally powerful viewing  
575,aliens_of_the_deep,yes  the work they re doing is mind boggling and important  but sometimes the images alone are more than capable of speaking for themselves  that imax 3 d cameras have plunged so deep to record an often bizarre array of sea creatures undoubtedly delivers a certain  wow  factor  but the accompanying commentary is heavier on breathless excitement than solid fact  a master showman s large format documentary  a movie with great images  great special effects and the sheen of hollywood often missing in these museum or science center movies  here we know only that cameron and his bright eyed young scientists  who take turns narrating  are heading to the deeper parts of the atlantic and pacific to observe the environment and life forms down there  cameron s showmanship and his on screen appearances make his documentaries far livelier than your usual imax nature documentary  and this one is no exception  we re treated to more intramural banter and golly gee chatter among the crew than we can use  and are not given enough scientific information  beyond a doubt the biggest movie ever made about shrimp  aliens of the deep is a technical marvel that still manages to fall somewhere severely south of marvelous  both dazzling underwater ballet and a welcome salvo for clarity in the current backlash against evolution  not a scientific documentary so much as a journey to an alien world  and basically what we want to do is peer out the portholes along with the explorers  one sign of a successful imax outing is how it makes you believe you are there in every frame  and this one does  the 48 minute spellbinder will make your jaw drop with awe  and  like the best documentaries  it will also make you think  
576,threeextremes,you can t believe what they re doing here  an instantly memorable  at times squirm inducing  assemblage as likely to take your breath away as it is to trigger the gag reflex  a strong effort from everyone involved  though they re not all wholly successful  one is haunting and wonderful  one is very good  and one spoils the fun  evokes a queasy fascination  blood  grotesquerie and humor mix equally in the first two  but the full combo makes a savory witches  brew for asian cinema cultists  or halloween lovers in need of a gore fix   you can t watch these three mini movies without wondering what you possibly can take from them  but there s warped creativity at work in all of them  and if you can separate talent from content  you ll see three very adventurous filmmakers at work  makes a persuasive argument for what s wrong with so many horror films today  a black blooded hoot  this trilogy provides a sampler of three short horror films from high profile asian directors  all three look great and the filmmakers deliver a certain artiness  but their overall triviality and the unpleasantness of the first two make for an extremely distasteful experience  
577,munich,munich can t decide where to end  so we get six or seven possible finishes  each exhausting  
578,layer_cake,an exercise in high style  high octane and low key suaveness  
579,match_point,the plotting lacks a necessary sense of tragic propulsion  it feels dutifully schematic  its ironies polite and tidy when they should be bitter and merciless  in every scene  allen s direction is unflinchingly clear eyed  and it s a pleasure being walked through london at the same unhurried pace that he s taken through manhattan all these years  match point  a film that makes us examine well considered questions in new light  is what woody allen sees when he gets out of his comfort zone  we can only hope he sees the benefit of travel  it s a film worth seeing several times  if you re lucky enough to get the chance  
580,dear_frankie,a bittersweet bonbon of a drama  full of the old fashioned literary touches that a well written letter still can deliver in the age of e mail  the film works as a highlight tape for the cast and will satisfy any desire you have to be driven to the brink of tears  there is no unnecessary dialogue  and auerbach encourages us to listen closely and to study the situation  we are required to learn truths slowly  at the same pace as the characters  gives us a spoonful of medicine to make the sugar go down  depending on your tolerance  it just may go down a treat  a little movie  and that shouldn t be taken as a pejorative  it can be sweet without being sickening  as heart rending as mcelhone s soulful gaze  director auerbach and her able cast dial down the volume on the performances  in the insightful hands of first time filmmaker shona auerbach and veteran actors who play their roles with intelligence  the movie deftly ducks the schmaltz  a soft hearted but soberly made little movie that gives sentimentality a good name  i m pleased to report that  within this overly familiar trope  there s plenty of room for small surprises  not the least of which are delightful  understated performances all around  a wrenchingly sweet and beautifully acted film that keeps surprising us    it never takes us where we think it s going  but always where we want to go  for all its sentimental superficiality  dear frankie is emotionally affecting  this sounds  i know  like the plot of a melodramatic tearjerker  but the filmmakers work close to the bone  finding emotional truth in hard  lonely lives  this wee scottish drama takes a mawkish premise and  by playing its cards close to the vest  imbues it with quiet  careworn dignity  an endearing  occasionally sentimental story told with depth and substance  one false note from actors or director  and the movie would collapse under the weight of fulfilling too many wishes  but it stays afloat with grace and even charm  
581,war_of_the_worlds,an intense sci fi experience that should satisfy viewers who crave both expensive special effects and intimate human drama  assuming that such an audience exists  how refreshing to see spielberg rock the boat with nothing more shocking than pure old fashioned fear 
582,lost_embrace,one of those foreign pictures that steeps us in a milieu so dense  yet so convincing  that we wind up believing and being beguiled by all its people and places  the tedious film might have been worth watching if burman had given reasons to care about ariel or anyone else  he doesn t and we don t  tilts toward preciousness but is rescued from its sentimental impulses by hendler  whose captivating deadpan belies ariel s abiding affection for the very people he can t wait to escape

584,1147812-warrior,it is hardly the most original story  but kapadia  the british born son of indian immigrants  infuses it so much with stately resonance and spiritual reverence  that it never seems remotely shopworn  much less laborious  long before the end  it takes on the quality of a wise fable and reveals itself as an enriching experience  if you can forgive its lapses in storytelling and character development  then kapadia s 2001 feature filmmaking debut delivers  at minimum  an impressive visual account of a worthwhile spiritual journey  a film for moviegoers who love powerful stories and ravishing imagery  the violence is of the high minded  self congratulatory sort that indicates without actually showing  this enables macho but  sensitive cineastes to revel remorselessly in the idea of decapitated heads  sliced necks and severed limbs  the warrior may be mighty of sword but he is exceedingly limp of writing  asif kapadia s feature debut is a minimalist but strikingly beautiful tale of renounced violence told with uncommon precision and depth  asif kapadia s blazing feature debut  a gorgeously photographed saga with a fine sense of the way place shapes personality  has won numerous awards in the filmmaker s native britain  if this moralistic apologue appears a tad too simplistic  at least the pictures are pretty  it s in the larger canvas that the picture ends up short  with an elliptical style that sometimes leaves the viewer bereft of information and a seeming unwillingness to dig deeper into the psychology of its main character  although the plot is over simplistic  kapadia sucks us into his exotic world using cinematic magic  
585,kontroll,you won t forget it soon  though it may give you at least some qualms about using the subway  especially if you re ever in budapest  visually stylish surrealist drama  these pieces come together  but they don t always fit  one of those hip  self consciously trippy existential thrillers that blow in from europe every now and then to rock the world of east village university students looking for a superficially meaningful event to legitimize their friday night bar crawl  like many modern allegories  nimrod antal s tour de force of grime  fluorescence and destinationless velocity is more concerned with atmosphere than meaning  
586,chronicles_of_narnia_lion_witch_wardrobe,adamson seems more comfortable with animated characters than real ones  
587,rock_school,succeeds as a riveting movie because it doesn t try to lead us from verse to an obvious chorus about green  or his uniquely abusive methods  director don argott does a superb job of capturing this unique institution and this great teacher  engrossing from its first shot to its final fade  
588,poohs_heffalump_movie,gentle story of friendship is fine for wee ones  during a time in which wall to wall pop culture references have become the standard in animated family fare  it s refreshing to find not a single drop of irony here  the film will keep children amused without proving too much of an ordeal for grown ups  while kids older than 8 may be too jaded to sit through this cute flick  at just over an hour  it may be the perfect fit for first time filmgoers  so insubstantial that it practically evaporates on screen  pooh s heffalump movie likely will play best with toddlers and pre schoolers easily amused by bright colors  merry songs and lovable  huggable toontoon animals  pooh s heffalump movie is a charmingly sweet experience for very young moviegoers that also may make their parents smile  heffalump certainly seemed to satisfy a rapt audience of young children at a saturday morning screening and who can argue with that  adults will become fidgety in the first 15 minutes  nervously checking their watches to see when the next pixar movie is coming out  sticking closely to formula  disney delivers a sweet script and charming storybook backgrounds  with serviceable  if sappy  songs from carly simon  
589,keane,unshakably harrowing but deeply moving  keane is emotionally involving right from the beginning through its final frame  
590,wedding_crashers,a bawdy summer comedy for adults and mature teens  this movie features rapid fire dialogue and sincere affection between best friend leads and strong chemistry between the actors who portray them  sharply honed  if often raunchy  this is the single most magnificent comedic portrayal i ve seen in ages  vaughn is a thunderclap so potent he steals every single scene he s in no matter whom he s sharing it with  outrageous set ups and saucy dialogue keep the party going and  while it staggers erratically to its conclusion  wedding crashers always has its heart in the right place  the laidback stars are funny and sweet  but they re let down by a patchy script which squanders some potentially priceless set ups  the most exhilarating entertainment to emerge this year from the failed  forlorn factory town of hollywood  largely because of owen wilson and vince vaughn  the best high low comedy team since the hey hey days of paul newman and robert redford  it produces more laughs per minute than any film so far this year  sometimes ten per cent of your brain is just enough  a maxim friendly riot that embraces the fact that discussions about sex usually involve terms more risqu  than  making love   wedding crashers may be the most optimistic hollywood comedy of the year  because it restores at least some dim hope that directors  writers and actors with actual brains in their heads can somehow triumph over unimaginative studio execs  the film s pleasures are greatly outnumbered by its failed expectations  
591,csa_the_confederate_states_of_america,the satire comes to feel strained and the whole premise gets awfully precious  reducing social subtleties to cinematic simplicities  there are droll comic flourishes in this very brave film  to be sure  but all you really want to do after watching csa is hang down your head and cry  a sometimes incisive  sometimes amateurish look at race in america  the things we do and tolerate as a nation that are really no different from an america ruled by unrepentant slave holders  a piece of well crafted righteous indignation  csa is a sophomoric film essay that would have barely rated a passing grade from a tougher teacher  
592,zathura_a_space_adventure,charming children s adventure with some superb performances from the young cast  a sci fi spin on 1995 s jumanji  jon favreau s fast paced fantasy is an enthralling  imaginative romp that does everything its predecessor did and more  the only way to win is just to keep playing until it s over  and the only way to leave the theater is to hover over these kids  shoulders until they finally wrap things up  in both cases  there are more entertaining ways to spend an afternoon  a smart and funny kids  movie that will also keep parents entertained  zathura ultimately comes across as little more than the template for an eventual kiddie friendly theme park attraction  in seeking to entertain adults as well as children  director jon favreau  elf  may have overplayed his hand a bit on the grown up side  zathura serves up kid friendly sci fi thrills  along with a little nostalgia for grownups  its low tech special effects are a refreshing departure from the cg norm  zathura is basically jumanji in outer space    and even without robin williams  this is still a singularly loud  charmless and overbearing family movie that could use a hit or two of ritalin  a wild buckle up and blast off adventure that plunges every corner of kids  favorite subject  after watching the kids play zathura in zathura    a crackling family adventure in which sibling rivalries play out against a backdrop of robbie like robot assaults and devouring gila monsters    all i can say is  let me at it  
593,sisterhood_of_the_traveling_pants,it sounds like a touchy feely gap commercial  but this fantastical premise jars with a refreshingly realistic look at girls making the tricky transition to womanhood  ferrera plays the role beautifully  navigating water filled with tension  conflict  pain  depression  self hatred and acerbic sarcasm with stunning ease  a sweet natured journey not to a galaxy far  far away  but to someplace just as mysterious  the first tentative steps toward adulthood  taken here by four teenage girls  the relationships and performances are strong and moving  with an effect both breezy fun and profound  sometimes it is only slightly more mature than your average vehicle for the olsen twins  it s unfair to pigeonhole this meaningful human story in that genre  especially since it feels more real than some adult chick flicks  besides  a good story is a good story  it s warm  endearing  upbeat and fast moving  it presents likable  goofy characters who confront adult issues that teens often face  working from a deft script by delia ephron  director ken kwapis labors hard so that guys won t cringe  too much  as four teen girls  of different body types  pass along the same pair of lucky jeans during a summer of love and loss  
594,upside_of_anger,allen s imperious turn and costner s affable charm go a long way to ensuring you ll look back on anger with affection  even though binder s characters are all gems  the filmmaker needs to further hone his storytelling craft  
595,in_her_shoes,a simple yet rich drama played with humour and compassion and blessed with excellent performances  considering it doesn t star maggie smith or judi dench  it s surprising how mature and moving this female focused drama is  i think one reason this movie is so appealing is that it s the anti sex and the city its earnestness and relative lack of rank bawdiness or cynicism seem novel in the present pop culture atmosphere  the landmasses of asia and africa took less time to split apart than this interminable film does to grind towards its emotionally forgiving conclusion  the movie gets much  much better as it goes along  maintains a breezy charm throughout and contains many extremely funny sequences  very well written  all the supporting performances are good  although in her shoes aims to rub along  with that scuffed worldliness which hanson has made his own  it keeps bumping into the archness of the romantic domestic genre  it s a rare film that requires a trash talking best friend and a lively  smart mouthed  comically blunt little old lady to liven things up  it s an even rarer film that can t be helped by either one  forsaking all art and subtlety  something he used to display in abundance  hanson has chosen to adapt a jennifer weiner novel that is so light  it should come with weights attached to keep it from floating away  collette s performance is so full of juice and the beneficiary of good dialogue that diaz s may end up being underrated  try on these shoes  even if you don t like the style  you will love where they take you  
596,beautiful_country,for much of the 125 minute running time  everything is so unrelentingly internalized it isn t until the very end it all almost magically clicks together  virtually slapping viewers across the face with its emotional resonating firepower  buoyed by a low key perf from tim roth en route and a splendid showing by nick nolte in the powerful final reels  the movie grows steadily more arresting as it goes on and saves its best parts for last  as binh inches closer to finding his dad  
597,land_of_the_dead,romero s fourth grade dialogue doesn t help matters  but anyone seeking out the latest achievements in cranial ruptures  spewing blood gouts  and ground beef spillage need look no further  zombies just aren t that interesting as villains because they zombie ahead  a lean  mean 93 minute serving of brain lust  stylized gore  morbid humor and chatty social commentary  this time  romero s aim is on american delusions of security and superiority in a post 9 11 world  gently comparing our current political decision makers with the clueless hoi polloi of fiddler s green  it s fairly solid fun without breaking any new ground  land of the dead not only leaves you wishing romero and his zombies might come back to feast once more  but that they d take their time  land does feel less substantial than its predecessors at a scant 92 minutes     but its novelty and nerve are the work of the master showing those feeding on his body of work how this zombie thing is done  land s gruesomely creative zombie atrocities stretch an r rating s limits like a bloody tendon about to snap  
598,syriana,this is intelligent  committed  and politically provocative  though its narrative puzzle box may prompt you to throw up your hands and let exxonmobil go on running the world  its dark  dog eat dog vision of the world we live in may give you geopolitical nightmares  it s entirely possible that gaghan just isn t an actor s director  demanding  even confusing at times  this is required viewing that requires your full attention  there is a weird absence of both dramatic heat and political light here  you ll come away exhausted  but also exhilarated  syriana is so powerful  so audacious in its commentary the fact some of it doesn t snap together or that a few of the layers are left hanging doesn t end up mattering anywhere near as much as it should  the stories are all densely packed with detail and convincingly told  watch closely and listen carefully during syriana because stephen gaghan s movie is that rarity  a thinking person s drama  it s hard to get passionately swept away by a movie when you re struggling continually to figure out who s doing what to whom and why  syriana coolly dissects a system of duplicity  chicanery and corruption that has been in play for several decades now  and examines the consequences that it has borne  
599,tropical_malady,an intriguing emotional and intellectual puzzle that made me feel exhilarated and contemplative  
600,pans_labyrinth,bewitchingly bonkers  it s less of a labyrinth than a forest path  one that takes you through wonderful scenery but doesn t lead anywhere  we are never allowed to get truly lost in pan s labyrinth  the fantasy sequences are fetching when they should be intoxicating  while the scenes above ground are largely prosaic  watching the unique explosions of guillermo del toro s mind realise themselves on screen is truly astounding  ofelia s smock is swiped from alice  her faun from narnia  and her magic book from harry potter  del toro sets her fairytale apart with its unrelenting gore and misery  pan s labyrinth suggests that fairy tale violence helps the vulnerable process and overcome real life conflicts and that real life violence permanently smashes the soul and the heart  it s as if lewis carroll s alice had wandered into a francisco goya painting  particularly the famously gruesome saturn devouring his son  in which an ancient demon has ripped the head off his progeny  it is an adult fairy tale that will lead grown ups to eagerly await the day that their own children will be old enough to understand  this backdrop of intrigue creates violent scenes that may have you turning away from the screen  beautifully designed and full of its own strange poetry  pan s labyrinth is nonetheless not a children s movie  take its  r  rating seriously  ofelia  you break our hearts  but you also restore our confidence in human decency  
601,casino_royale,unlike recent bonds  whose kills had no more weight than the one liners that generally accompanied them  craig s tend to be intimate  bloody  and devoid of glamour  daniel craig  an excellent actor  has more than earned his walther ppk  casino royale takes us back to basics  to a leaner production and to a bond who looks like he can do serious damage let s say straight off that craig is very good indeed  everything about his performance shows cunning and grace  casino royale has the answers to all my complaints about the 45 year old james bond series  and some i hadn t even thought of  i hope craig finds more moments like that in bond  and i hope he gets to wear that tuxedo again and again and again  i consider daniel craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007  and that includes even sean connery  the first bond film to actually prize three dimensional characters and moral dilemmas over action film flash  daniel craig is a fair haired  bare knuckle antidote to pierce brosnan  on the action adventure level  it hits the bulls eye  there s clearly life in the old dog yet  welcome to the new world of mi6 s most storied agent  
602,the_queen,a lesser director might make all of this deadly earnest  but frears treats it as what you might call a tragi comedy of manners  perfectly serious but human foibles everywhere  like blair  we are moved from skepticism to sympathy and ultimately to respect by the stunning performances and the perceptive screenplay  palace intrigue at its finest  allows us to understand just how heavy the crown really sits  although mirren transforms into a living human being as artfully as any actor i have ever seen in stephen frears  portrait of a woman and royalty under siege  the movie in which she performs this alchemy is every bit as good as she is  frears has given us a front row seat for a backstage drama  the result is provocatively realistic  frears masterfully combines archival news footage with stellar performances from an outstanding cast  led by mirren in a title role that demands oscar glory  succeeding where most docudramas fail  it turns a slice of recent history into a revealingly intelligent entertainment  without being didactic at one extreme or sentimental at the other  
603,deliver_us_from_evil,grander statements aren t needed when the specific indictments are so plentiful and so horrifying  
604,children_of_men,p d  james s novel must have made more sense than cuar n s cheerful but incoherent screen adaptation  if you thought the battle scenes in    saving private ryan were tough going  the final 20 minutes of children of men will not only shake you  they ll have you revising your expectations about just how realistic cinematic portrayals of combat can get  cuaron asks us to find hope in a grim nativity story where a reluctant hero and scared would be mother try to find shelter in a land that desperately needs a newborn savior  children of men feels more relevant than almost every film set in the present day and is better than almost every other film made this year  you feel as if you re accompanying a war photographer who s lost a bet  slogging unflinchingly through humanity s worst hours  the movie laces the narrative s forays into science fiction grandstanding with a gut wrenching dynamic  what i find particularly irksome about it is its pseudo humanism and its calculating political correctness  a superior sci fi thriller and the best doomsday drama since 28 days later  despite the bleakness of its vision  children of men is also thrilling  both for its groundbreaking style  there are action sequences here unlike any filmed before  and its complex  vividly realized ideas  cuar n does lowdown takes on high concept better than anyone  no matter what genre he touches  he brings grit and loose limbed humor along with the hand held camera jangles  darkly poetic throughout  the film starts with an explosion and ends drifting in fog with no clear resolution in sight  how brave and oddly satisfying  you can see it now or wait 20 years until the movie has found a niche among equally visionary movies that have the capacity to compel  alarm and shake things up  
605,departed,the biggest draw  of course  are the star acts  caprio  damon and mark wahlberg in particular are electric  if you like scorsese  or if you just like thrillers  you ll have a good time  the departed is an example of a cinematic master seeking to live up to the veneration with which he is regarded by his pupils  nicholson is on good to great form as the paternal brute  and lends an inimitable relish to certain lines in william monahan s screenplay  as in his remake of cape fear  scorsese has mucked up a b movie he professes to love  producing something full of twists but devoid of that lovely  fluttery  rare thing  surprise  plausible psychological scrutiny loses out to shot after shot of brains being splattered  and boy  do you get a lot of brains for your buck  it s just a shame they re all on the walls and not in the script  this crime thriller is a profane  blood drenched joy to watch  nicholson s unsavoury grin and seedy menace are a joy to behold  it all makes for extremely watchable entertainment  scorsese takes william monahan s brilliant adaptation and completely makes it his own  resulting in not only one of the best movies of the year but also one of the best of his amazing career  the departed s lucky charmed score is one of many subliminal devices in the film  no one better lay a hand on scorsese s oscar  the departed has enough tension to keep you engrossed  and enough color for ten crime pictures  scorsese obviously adores his expensive  expansive ensemble  
606,war_tapes,they expected tension  what they didn t expect was to serve out their year long deployment as  essentially  the world s most targeted grocery store security  arguably the most vital and eye opening documentary yet made regarding the united states  current military entanglement  the film succeeds because of its refreshingly low key emotional approach and its refusal to impose character arcs or political agendas on its subjects  footage  a remarkable film  a you are there document that allows us to worry about the soldier who s risking his life even as we ponder the rights and wrongs of this military engagement  an absolutely spellbinding first person documentary of regular soldiers in the iraq war  as seen through digital cameras carried into combat  director deborah scranton  co producer and editor steve james and co producer robert may managed to assemble the immense footage into a taut  often searing 97 minutes  moriarty  pink and bazzi sent back tape loaded with visual and audio detail  but the most moving moments of the war tapes are their attempts to make sense of operation iraqi freedom ii  a fascinating chronicle of wartime  told by several distinct and vivid narrators  what it does do  with grim and often gruesome honesty  is show the realities of war to a public that has been largely shielded from its cost  a gripping documentary that takes embedding pretty much right inside the soldiers  brains  
607,mountain_patrol_2006,mixes environmental awareness and spiritual mindfulness with its chase scenes through grand scenery  a nomadic life and death struggle evoking classic hollywood western themes of dogged honor and rugged idealism  director lu chuan took his lumps by filming the movie on location in an inhospitable locale  but his decision to do so is validated by the final result  
608,blindsight,you wouldn t believe it as fiction but it really is fairly unadorned fact  it is easy to see awards beckoning  and deservedly so because walker as a film maker never puts herself in front of her extraordinary subjects  lucy walker s documentary blindsight is breathtaking twice over  it leaves the audience gasping like a landed guppy at views of snow coddled himalayan peaks under ice blue skies  blindsight is a great example of the emotional dividends that careful photography  sensitive editing and an atmospheric score can deliver  to see how these conflicts play out  to see how both sides came to realize that they had unexpected things to learn from these remarkable young people  is where blindsight really makes its mark  it is a truly one of a kind story of survival  persistence and achievement  and by the time it was over i was moved so thoroughly beyond words i almost didn t know what to do next  you take them with you as you leave the theater  knowing that your bad day probably isn t as rough as you first thought and inspiring the realization that anyone can climb the peaks of their own lives  it s a must see  walker captures all the dreamy scary beauty of everest s upper reaches  as well as numerous mini dramas about the kids  readiness to approach the summit  simultaneously a sports adventure film  a tear jerking tale of hope and inspiration and a captivating meditation on culture clash  blindsight is hugely affecting  the rare experience that will make those who watch it thankful for what they have  yet make them realize that they aren t nearly thankful enough  the film overcomes its crude production values and awkward structuring  it stirs you  lucy walker s observant film blindsight is about profound east west differences in the importance of journey versus destination and comradeship versus competition  there are enough good stories for three movies in lucy walker s blindsight  an exhilarating trip with six blind tibetan teenagers as they scale one of the highest peaks in the himalayas  
609,borat,borat s cultural learning is revealing  even if it doesn t adequately convey how it benefits glorious nation of kazakhstan  the backlash just proves how deep a nerve the faux kazakh journalist has hit  the theory of comedy here is that you can get away with almost anything if you manage to make your target audience feel superior to the human beings being mocked on the screen  borat is so gut bustingly funny it should carry a health warning  cohen s genius lies in combining the chameleon like virtuosity of peter sellers with the balls out fearlessness of the jackass crew  somewhere in standup comedy heaven andy kaufman is smiling  possibly even busting a gut  the cheerfully tasteless borat is often screamingly funny and almost never dull  and that s more than i can say for just about every comedy to grace screens this year  borat  cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan is as fearless as mockumentaries get  crude  confrontational and stunningly sick  it s a movie made in the fringe tradition of pink flamingos  featuring a performer who seems to be willing to do anything for the camera  expect to laugh uproariously  expect to choke back horror and revulsion  often at yourself  
610,49_up,this seventh installment is utterly fascinating  drawing heavily on footage from the previous movies to follow each child on the journey into middle age  i can think of no single movie  fictional or factual  that more strongly awakens our common humanity or that establishes such a marvelous  tight bond with its characters  i ll wait breathlessly for 56 up  and hope this brave group will speak to the camera again  giving us the gift of a share in their lives  dropping by on the same people every seven years like an old friend    or an unwelcome relative    apted has constructed a peerless  suspenseful work that develops character to a depth that would make tolstoy jealous  when i saw 42 up in 1999  i thought the series had run its natural course and that it was time to leave the  kids  alone  i was wrong  they have just entered a new and exciting phase of lives that are very much works in progress  i won t bother you with all the particulars because that would steal the film s thunder  know  though  that apted includes enough footage from previous films to remind us of details we may have forgotten  they re both fascinating and timeless  and like the hopes and dreams we carry with us from the day we re born to the day we die apted s series captures humanity at every spectrum of its evolution  this long documentary is captivating  not because you re peeking at lives of real people  but because it captures the way time heals all wounds and how people find a way out of deep holes if they are determined to do so  the films have taken on an autumnal shade as we revisit people who seem quietly aware that the years behind them are more than those ahead  
611,little_miss_sunshine,the best thing about american cinema is that besides the studio assembled big ticket movies  there s also the flourishing indie film movement which keeps throwing up some delightfully refreshing movies  all indie movie families may start out unhappy in their own way  but by the time the final credits roll  everyone remains complacent  confident of their brood s superiority

617,10008507-deep_water,the details just get stranger and stranger  as directed by louise osmond and jerry rothwell  the movie breezes along at a highly watchable clip  thanks to fluid  affecting intercutting of archival  black and white footage and present day interviews  the film evokes a visceral understanding of solitude at sea  some beautiful shots give unexpected texture to the film  such as an underwater capture of a boat from below  with prisms of light surrounding it  and its final image is a quiet heartbreaker  for this gripping and amazing documentary  such truth emerges not just from the facts  but also the poetry of men who redefine themselves in a risky race on small sailboats  deep water is a stunning documentary that not only beautifully elucidates a nearly forgotten incident but touches on crucial themes involving isolation  sanity  self worth  impossible dreams  the nature of heroism and limits of human endurance  one of this year s better studies of the human soul  osmond and rothwell s depiction of his unraveling is an exquisitely structured drama  to reveal crowhurst s decision would be to spoil a stunning tale  deep water is not itself comparably stunning  despite the flaws in the structure and story of deep water  osmond and rothwell display great skill at keeping their audience informed  a fascinating documentary about the first single handed around the world sailing race  begins like a boy s own adventure tale but ends up more akin to tragedy  an enthralling documentary about an englishman named donald crowhurst who  in 1968  set off on a solitary  nonstop circumnavigation of the globe  a spooky  moving doc that chronicles the first solo attempt to circle the world by boat  a true life tale of inadvertent self destruction  deep water s generic title belies its haunting incisiveness  given that the tedium of months on the open seas could and did drive a man insane  co directors louise osmond and jerry rothwell have done a commendable job of making deep water    well  not boring  
618,volver,it s up to charm to twinkle our attention away from the loose threads and daytime tv plotting  even if volver sounds too high concept for you  know that almod var is smart enough not to rest on laughs alone  extending his premise to dark  though occasionally tidy psychological territory  it s clever and entertaining  it s marvelously deft  but never daffy  it works well enough  despite feeling like the most conventional film this great  envelope pushing spanish director has ever made  the film is realistic  yet almod var s touch of the absurd and the madcap infiltrate everything that occurs while his candy colored visual palette lends a brightness to what in other hands might have taken the form of a sordid tale  if almodovar is in great form  cruz is even shapelier  with no small number of gags involving her cleavage  volver qualifies as a must see movie for the director s fans or for those who wish to admire one of the greatest living cinema artists  spanish director pedro almod var always has fun toying with our perceptions and expectations and does it yet again with volver  a darkly comic look at mortality and family secrets  a deeply entertaining experience that engages our hearts as well as our funny bones  a feast of colours  swooning camera movements  lushly orchestrated musical cues and meticulously fetishized symbolism  the result is intoxicating  a free spinning story that s by its end enormously satisfying  creating its own kind of magic  the women are left to do the best they can  that turns out to be enough to keep you watching through to the final twist    as unlikely as everything else in this nonetheless extremely likable movie  
619,tell_no_one_2006,canet has covered his bases with enough swooping camerawork  narrative smoke and mirrors  and quick sketched supporting characters for a dozen thrillers canet has a good feeling for lowlife atmosphere and he works up a few fine hitchcockian twirls  although it might make your head spin  this case of vertigo in cyberspace keeps us spellbound  a whodunit so nicely crafted that you re tempted to forgive the byzantine plot    hell  you re even tempted to pretend you actually understand its twisting obscurities  it attempts no improvements on the basic suspense formula  it just does everything really well  perfect pacing  lovely camera work  spot on acting and an ingenious plot  
620,offside,offside is a slow slog through bloated scenes with little happening  framed and shot like a crude documentary  it proceeds in long  clunky takes  as if an editor couldn t be bothered  humanizes the iranians and shows that they re just as crazy about their sports as westerners  if not more  if anything  it proves that soccer is truly an international language  providing an arena where anyone can communicate   director  panahi has perfected the art of realist filmmaking  here turning his camera on scenes that seem more improvised or captured on the fly than staged  the director shoots largely on location    parts were filmed at azadi stadium during an actual match    and mixes fiction and documentary so deftly we can t tell which is which  most of this winning drama shows  girls  bantering with their male keepers  boyish soldiers who don t want to miss the game themselves  over the crowd s roar  they argue about islamic prohibitions and the statistics of star players  as the political rhetoric between washington and tehran becomes dangerously overheated  offside offers an intimate antidote  an affectionate glimpse into the cultural schisms that young tehranis face every day  offside may be the ultimate iranian film  it s both an advance for its director  moving away from his slight political didacticism  and a perfect metaphor for a population that s more liberated than its stone age sexism would imply  obviously there s more than soccer at stake here  with the field standing for the world of ideas itself  how do we dare keep any group from entering  how will we ever succeed at keeping them out  we don t  says this film  and we can t  the story is good natured  but panahi s message is serious  that ludicrous rules turn iranian women into third class citizens  and what better way is there to get that point across than through sports and laughter  director jafar panahi has long been an eloquent and passionate representative for iranian women  but judging by this deeply poignant comedy  they may not need a mouthpiece much longer  
621,block_party,yes  there s a little preachiness here  but it doesn t puncture the party mood  or stop chappelle telling dirty jokes about prostitutes  for that matter  thanks to him this isn t just a musical feast  but a rib busting comedy too  chappelle keeps things lively  joking on camera  punctuating the acts with gags   while michel gondry maintains our interest  focusing as much on chappelle s energy and wit  and goings on behind the scenes  as the gig itself  this is effectively an inner city woodstock    only funny  a return to rowdy form  no one enjoys the free festivities more than chappelle  who wanders through the film like a kid on christmas morning  a very funny kid  chappelle s talent and the characters in the movie give it a universal appeal  even to those unfamiliar with hip hop  it s intermittently funny  but it peaks too soon and runs far too long  and for all its length  block party doesn t tell us much about chappelle that we haven t seen before  the music is angry and the jokes are raw but  ultimately  block party conveys a positive message to audiences  instead of competition  we see collaboration between the artists and unity in the diverse crowd  strictly for fans of the musical acts and those who think everything chappelle does is genius  the genius of what gondry and chappelle accomplish is to make the music  the setting and the people soaking it all in universal for everyone no matter who they are or what their background  while unlikely to enter the annals of great concert filmmaking  dave chappelle s block party does capture the moment at hand with a breezy  offhanded and utterly user friendly charm  there are just enough provocative notes hit for  block party  to stand out as more than just a frivolous good time  though it can be enjoyed in that way as well   watching the concert on screen is almost as good as being there  his racial jokes have an edge  but they are not as deadly as the chappelle s show skits  gangly  disarming and slyly witty  chappelle is at ease with people of all ages and races  and has a knack for finding humour without forcing it     an off the wall celebration that mixes humor and music to amusing  if not life changing  effect  
622,tuyas_marriage_2006,a refusal to pass judgment and a palpable chemistry between the actors ensure that the film succeeds both as a fable about the pitfalls of rapid modernisiation  and as tough  unsentimental drama  this 2006 drama is refreshing not only for its gentle comic touches but for director wang quanan s refusal to sentimentalize china s vanishing nomadic culture  life is harsh and no one s a saint  including his outspoken heroine  made with a scrupulous attention to the slow moving realities of grasslands life but lacking in dramatic heft   yu nan  owns the role of tuya  delivering a wide ranging performance that might be called  star making  if she didn t already suggest the confidence of an established star  director wang quan an shows us a china of contrasts and in transition  where a life of traditional farming is harder than ever to sustain while life in the nearest city includes nice hotels  decent health care and good schools  for those who are still reeling from the forced exuberance of mamma mia  but have room for one more film about a woman with multiple suitors  may i recommend tuya s marriage  a strong addition to the burgeoning canon of china s so called sixth generation filmmakers  tuya s marriage is thoroughly gratifying in its consistent inventiveness and has a grasp of human nature so universal that there s no feeling of the exotic about the film and its people  it is a fine and plaintive experience  more modern day folklore than ethnographic study  and a wonderfully assured piece of cinema  a compact near masterpiece that combines a slow motion romantic comedy with a docudrama style portrait of a remote  nomadic culture as it is gradually eroded by the tides of the 21st century  tuya s marriage finds an austere beauty in a landscape of scrub and grassland ringed by forbidding slate blue mountains   director wang quan  still maintains an emotional remove from his subject  tracing the encroaching will of capitalism as in the evolution from horses to motorcycles to cars more clinically than poetically  tuya s marriage can feel a tad overwritten  but in terms of its cultural and emotional portraits  the film s neo realist authenticity is nonetheless striking  
623,1153570-fateless,fateless looks man s inhumanity to man square in the eye and pronounces it standard operating procedure  and that may be the greater horror  perhaps the fault lies more with ennio morricone s lavish  emotionally bullying music  which cancels out all the reticence and nuance of the script  we re meant to see the camps with a naive adolescent eye  but director koltai misjudges his material  and his fastidious paletting and highly orchestrated set pieces are curiously low impact  beautiful where they should be beastly  a reflection of how its main character comes to experience reality  as one small moment between what came before and whatever horror or happiness is yet to come  many of the images in fateless are familiar  but they re presented so unsparingly  so uncloaked by emotion  they become freshly potent  the film is on a level just slightly below schindler s list and the pianist  and only because koltai is a less powerful  practiced director than either steven spielberg or roman polanski  fateless presumes audiences know the details of how european jews moved from ghettos to camps to liberation  so koltai frequently jumps right past the big changes  and dwells instead on the tedious hours inside the train on the way to auschwitz  an with its first person approach  fateless joins other classic films about the holocaust  shoah  schindler s list  by vividly portraying an event that can seem remote as the number of eyewitnesses shrinks each year  fateless accomplishes the near impossible  bringing a fresh perspective to a horrific subject about which a multitude of films already have been made  koltai  a veteran cinematographer whose credits include more than a dozen movies by istv n szab   mephisto  sunshine   has managed something near miraculous with this hypnotically paced  lyrically downbeat  weirdly dreamlike 140 minute movie  not only do the scenes set during the war develop a cumulative emotional power  but those in the war s immediate aftermath give us a glimpse into a truth seldom explored    a truth that only a survivor can possess  fateless is an extraordinary film  not just for its harrowing attention to detail of life within the concentration camps  but for the equal place of privilege it gives to life before and after world war ii  this unique and devastating look at the holocaust is drawn from the autobiographical novel of 2002 nobel prize winner imre kertesz  
624,half_nelson,ryan gosling s self destructive teacher is easily the year s most mesmerizing character study  and he s hardly the only reason to see this film  shareeka epps anchors her scenes as drey with a self possession way beyond her years  it s impressively adult  sure footed filmmaking  and that best actor nod was definitely deserved  an original work that is moving  not without humour  fly on the wall realistic and uplifting  it takes a while to settle into the rhythm  feeling episodic at first   but half nelson soon takes hold with a vice like grip  gosling is indeed amazing as a bewildered  depressed new york schoolteacher who is slipping into dire drug addiction  it s exactly the kind of star turn in a smaller film that academy voters could  and should  notice  although the subject promises more than the film can deliver  there is compensation in gosling s convincing  unromanticized portrayal of someone seeking escape from longing and loss that neither he nor the movie can really define  for a solid 107 minutes  gosling shapes his character into a flesh and blood tone poem  it ll be weeks before i shake off  gosling s  performance    or the shadows of this small  extraordinary narrative feature debut from filmmaking partners ryan fleck and anna boden  one might also argue that a crack addict couldn t be responsible enough to be a good teacher  but he s the most believable protagonist in any american movie i ve seen this year  a wholly absorbing and delicately shaded portrait of an educator played by ryan gosling  a young man harboring an offstage secret  in the endlessly surprising half nelson  all those upbeat  hollywood clich s about well meaning outsiders making a difference are turned on their heads  
625,the_death_of_mr_lazarescu,a sly anti er infused with implacable existential clarity that will send shivers up your spine  
626,jonestown_the_life_and_death_of_peoples_temple,stanley nelson revisits the 1978 mass suicide of jim jones and his flock in guyana  savoring the horror but offering no new insights  a somber  solid documentary  parading  the whole bleak tale before us again  complete with those disturbing scenes of hundreds of corpses in their tees and shorts and flip flops strewn about facedown in the mud of jonestown  guyana  the last half hour of jonestown is almost unwatchable  video footage of the assault on the congressman s delegation gives way to audio of jones exhorting people to  die with a degree of dignity  as children shriek in the background  jonestown is not an easy movie to watch  but it s a solid presentation of an important chapter in american and religious history  haunting is the only word that truly fits  jonestown is a thoroughly conventional documentary   but this familiar format also emphasizes the movie s universality  while jonestown lacks the power of revelation  it s a first rate piece of journalism  as fascinating and thorough as any magazine article  this calm and thorough film has just the right attitude and tone to deal with a most incendiary story     collects declassified cia photos  film and audiotapes made by jones  followers to form an astonishingly complete picture of what happened  jones was a charlatan who faked healings  demanded sexual favors of members and committed all sorts of criminal acts  with such a wealth of documented footage and firsthand testimony  it is unconscionable that nelson should leave us with more questions dangling than answered  when it comes to how those followers turned into a zombie kool aid death cult  jonestown  the life and death of peoples temple leaves you with more questions than you went in with  offers a sophisticated thesis  digging into the reasons why people joined the peoples temple

628,blame_it_on_fidel,the comedy always feels enriching rather than demeaning  
629,the_last_king_of_scotland,having cut his teeth on documentaries  kevin macdonald acts as if a shaky cam aesthetic alone is enough to fuel dramatic tension  
630,inside_man,i gloried in the sheer spectacle of jodie foster as madeline white  an exquisitely groomed  fearlessly feline fixer striding on her high heels and her high horse into one supposedly perilous situation after another  lee seems less interested in scoring easy sociological points than ratcheting up the stakes of gewirtz s cunning heist scenario  which offers little in the way of wiggle room for latecomers  
631,venus,if only  director  michell s film actually said something about aging  and didn t feel the need to include grumpy old men shtick and bland bossa nova inflected pop  even performances as good as these can t totally transcend material that hovers between near farce and tragi comedy without ever landing on a convincing level  
632,duck_season_2006,a nuanced  authentic portrait of adolescent ennui and maturation that treats pre teen emotions with a jim jarmusch ian brand of detached sympathy and bemusement  imagine waiting for godot performed by the breakfast club  often dull dialogue and marginally interesting characters  devotes itself to youthful inertia  by the end  we realize that a bit of truth has been uncovered by eimbcke  a director we ll no doubt be hearing from again  give duck season a chance  sit on your watch for the first 20 minutes and see what happens  eimbcke s gentle persuasion will reward your patience for weeks to come  a film so small and understated that it was nearly over before i realized how much i was going to miss these characters once their story had been told  not very much really happens in duck season  but in its rich details  it remembers how absorbing and endless every single day can seem when you re 14  the film s calm and witty visual rhythm offers a rueful awareness of time passing and of time wasted  in ways that people tend not to appreciate fully until long after they ve wasted it  a modest  beautifully proportioned peek into the lives of four uncertain young characters who aren t yet fully formed  summing up duck season is a simple enough affair  but hardly does justice to this ironic  carefully crafted comedy  the latest indication that mexican cinema is going through one of its spasmodic periods of renaissance  
633,dixie_chicks_shut_up_and_sing,a melodic wakeup call  where bluegrass meets grassroots politics  exposing almost as much small mindedness as borat did  this provides food for thought as well as some darned good ditties  
634,heart_of_gold,pleasant  but hardly pulse quickening stuff     even those who haven t followed young s every recent move could well find his performance here surprisingly captivating  the best moments in the film are when ellen kuras s camera just sits there taking in the whole stage  the whole gorgeous ecosystem  it doesn t penetrate his craggy mystique  or make us hear his music in a new way  instead  it s the same old choir song  vividly captures young s greatness by simply letting him do his thing  this chronicle of the human condition set to music will only rise in value and statue over time  this prairie wind concert is one long sweet twang of wistful not quite regret  it does what the best movies of any genre do  turn the produced and scripted into something sincere and honest  few artists are so adept at addressing the past and embracing the future all at once  and few recent films have so gracefully captured a musician at a specific point in his time  i couldn t help but wish that as long as young was making a new film with a top tier director at the helm  he would have provided more insight into his life  as martin scorsese s recent tv documentary did for bob dylan  
635,notes_on_a_scandal,almost unbearably tense as the relationship between cat and mouse takes completely unexpected  if completely believable  turns  
636,iraq_in_fragments,james longley s devastating documentary iraq in fragments has neither narration nor obvious political ax to grind  but it manages to tell us something about iraq that we aren t getting or can t get from standard news coverage  the frequently gorgeous footage  culled from some 300 hours shot over a two year period  provides ample compensation for any narrative  this visually sumptuous movie richly deserves the cinematography  editing and directing prizes it carried off at sundance last january  
637,brand_upon_the_brain,the director s form of genial cinematic dementia is guaranteed not to be to all tastes at all times  but those who are looking for something strange and different will feel right at home  for me it captures maddin at his loopiest and most inspired  narrated by isabella rossellini and enhanced by jason staczek s superb score  this is characteristically intense and  unlike most of maddin s silent movie models  frenetically edited  no matter how much the director disguises the tale in flickery symbolism  the emotions feel painful and personal  brand upon the brain  is like no other movie you re likely to see this year    or any other year  it won t be to everyone s taste  but for those who like their cinema weird  it doesn t get any weirder or more oddly fascinating than this  you don t want to miss one frenzied minute of it  succeeds at one and the same time in functioning as both a celebration and a deconstruction of the conscious and unconscious glories of silent movies through the barely 30 years of their existence at the beginning of the 20th century  a typically spastic  experimental mix of old fashioned movie effects and overheated freudian melodrama  a surprisingly frightening and affecting film  launching itself from vertiginous peaks into shadowy hollows  canadian filmmaker guy maddin pushes his love of lurid melodrama to the limit in his latest demented treat  brand upon the brain  avant garde to the last shuttering edit  guy maddin s signature aesthetic is also  paradoxically enough  a classical fusion of style and content  written by mr  maddin and george toles  his longtime screenwriting partner  the story builds on familiar types and narrative conventions that  over time  are all but obscured by layer upon layer of idiosyncratic detail  the inimitable guy maddin outdoes himself with psyche probing silent film  
638,descent,while i think we should question the authority of the ubiquitous male writer director to shape horror productions  i think marshall does a good job representing his female characters  can audiences weaned on the murky sadism of the saw movies and the hills have eyes remake even recognize what a truly scary movie looks and feels like  while the movie has wonderful moments of unmotivated tension that make sure we re quite ill at ease from the beginning  it s also got a few too many of the kind of cheap boo scares that indicate a director not fully trusting his grip on you  tight shots of women desperately wriggling through worm holes or teetering on a ledge overlooking an abyss create a claustrophobic effect  one that leaves the characters gasping for air and the audience breathing shallower  do we even need men in horror films any more  they re bound to do something stupid  they almost always get killed in the end and don t look as good covered in sweat and blood  not since james cameron burst onto the scene with the terminator has a director crafted as deliriously kinetic a calling card as writer director neil marshall does with his new horrific subterranean adventure the descent  prepare to be scared senseless  and then  when you think you have it figured  your certainty will be shaken by scenes built to scare you even more  every theater should come with a sign  your expectations must be this low to ride  working on terrific sets with imaginative lighting effects and cinematography  marshall creates a palpable sense of claustrophobia and danger well before murderous cave dwellers make their appearance quite a ways into the movie  the descent seems less about female empowerment than female misery  one wonders if marshall has issues  no males suffer here  just women who  even if they survive  won t ever be the same again  the film redeems itself through the denouement  building on that initial psychological foundation to hint disturbingly at a metaphoric struggle with interior demons  
639,starter_for_ten,there s nothing here we haven t seen done better before  some nice performances and modest laughs highlight this amiable british comedy about a young man who goes off to bristol university in the mid  80s and does what young people naturally do when they go to college  james mcavoy may be the most likable british newcomer since ewan mcgregor  his glistening eyes can seduce audiences with their ability to show conflicting emotions  
640,who_killed_the_electric_car,another few of these squandered opportunities for art house muckraking and we ll need someone to ask who killed the left wing documentary  this fascinating feature length documentary tells the shameful story of how fast  economical electric cars became a hit in california in the 1990s  then vanished almost overnight  it posits a necessary question in these days of ever burgeoning oil prices and ever shrinking supply  and it offers distressing insights into the corporate american mindset  paine s disarmingly impassioned movie sees nothing but short term sinister interests behind the forced disappearance of a viably long term solution  
641,thank_you_for_smoking,there s enough bite in the dialogue and performances to provoke a hacking cough of approval  and the laugh out loud moments are many  not least in scenes featuring rob lowe s unctuous hollywood agent  aiming at all targets and hitting none of them  the movie is as harmless and inconsequential as a candy cigarette  structural scrappiness aside  it remains a laudably amoral and superbly caustic comedy for those who like their satire strong and unfiltered  even the good lines here last a self congratulatory beat too long  a snarkily playful little comedy that gets so wrapped up in its own barbed witticisms that it fails to land even the lightest sucker punches on the black  bleak big business institutions it aims to skewer  reitman  still in his 20s  knows something that many more seasoned directors never figure out  how to make audiences laugh along with a film that s laughing at itself  literate and smirky in its assault on liars and fools across the map  enjoyable not only because it shows the duplicity of spinning but because it allows its characters to revel in the joy they experience as contemporary con artists  a smart aleck satire with something on its mind is always welcome  writer director jason reitman  here adapting buckley s 1994 lampoon of the tobacco lobby  understands that the author s verbal slapstick and pyrotechnical plot turns are both smart and broad  the story of thank you for smoking resides in that libertarian netherworld where the far left and the far right march shoulder to shoulder  
642,1158179-devil_and_daniel_johnston,feuerzeig was able to fashion such a thorough  engaging film partly because aficionados such as lee renaldo of sonic youth shot so much footage of johnston performing and acting out  
643,after_the_wedding,there s nothing quite as devastating as tragedy treated with sharp and precise northern european restraint  
644,stephanie_daley,thought provoking and mesmerising  you are likely to be discussing this film long into the night  apart from swinton s fine performance  what largely distinguishes this is brougher s sharp narrative focus  tamblyn s surprisingly measured performance commands attention  with a calmness that bespeaks confidence  this small  spellbinding second feature by hilary brougher brings together two women  trapped in separate states of denial and distress  who manage to end each other s entrapment  most persuasive as a realist family drama made by a writer director whose forte is the accretion of quotidian detail that  as much as any crisis  tells us who her characters are  stephanie daley has a few overly arty moments  yet there s a careful and very welcome literary feel to its story  and something heartbreakingly real about the characters it contains  the movie amounts to an extended short story that progresses slowly and fades away with key questions unanswered  ambiguity isn t necessarily interesting  without standing on a soapbox stephanie daley suggests a tragic gender gap between men who judge and women who feel  brougher s film would seem more like the drudge work of a lot of made for tv melodramas if it weren t for its plausibly raw suburban atmosphere and the zone of intimacy established by both co producer swinton and  especially  tamblyn  this lacerating drama from writer director hilary brougher shines a piercing light onto some of the hidden terrors of women  especially in an era when abstinence can shade into ignorance  
645,slither,there s something winning about this grab bag of orally fixated invertebrates and mucus covered noids  
646,1196293-reprise,this story about two aspiring writers in their early 20s has the fearlessness and vivacity of a first novel  and its playful approach to chronology and voice over narration serves to amplify its themes instead of coming off as a show off trick  reprise is not just about engaging with or surviving through the creative instinct  it is that instinct  the jagged energy of this film s opening and closing moments leave you wondering where it might have gone and what it might have been  drawing inspiration from the young artists in angst tales of godard  truffaut and the french new wave  joachim trier s reprise is both a charming homage and a vibrant work in its own right  reprise has a smart and knowing script and will compel audiences to reflect on themselves at that age  the cinema is an ideal medium for considering characters like those in  reprise   but you d have to see jules and jim to find out why  they really get the young writers and that enthusiasm  but then also that heartbreak  an intelligent and occasionally profound portrait of a pair of artists as young men  
647,man_push_cart,it s by no means an exaggeration to describe this quietly powerful film as bressonian  
648,jesus_camp,why bother with horror films when you can see this  
649,sir_no_sir,we haven t got space to do justice to david zeiger s important historical documentary sir  no sir  but suffice it to say that it will change your understanding of the vietnam era  even if you were alive then  i expected to emerge depressed by how long these stories have gone untold  but the speakers  courage and humanity are a shot in the arm  zeiger s movie is a timely salute to the risky and brave men and women who had the temerity not only to think for themselves but to speak their minds  about an almost forgotten fact of the vietnam era  anti war sentiment among u s  troops grew into a problem for the pentagon  honors those who fought  then questioned the morality of that fight  then joined the national protest  while a great number of former servicemen are interviewed for the film  their largely one on one recollections and testimonies are greatly magnified by the massive amount of archival visual footage presented here  hawks and doves alike should be grateful to zeiger for preserving a fascinating piece of american cultural history that the vets recount here  it s an invaluable record of what some soldiers felt about the war they fought and what some soldiers did about it when they returned home  sir  no sir  movingly captures the raw excitement of grunts discovering their power and their voices in their ability to resist  a powerful documentary that uncovers half forgotten history  history that is still relevant but not in ways you might be expecting  this is powerful stuff  offering us not only a new look at the past  but to the unavoidably relevant insights into the present  if there was such a widespread antiwar movement within the military  why did the war drag on so long  
650,three_burials_of_melquiades_estrada,this gripping film about real people is well worth excavating  don t let the near impossible to remember title keep you away from this singular and slightly surreal tommy lee jones scorcher  behind the hype lies a banal morality tale told in needlessly jumbled flashbacks and gorged with gruesome atrocities out of a sam peckinpah flick  
651,sophie_scholl_die_letzten_tage,rothemund and screenwriter fred breinersdorfer have locked themselves into an episodic structure that offers virtually no nuance  
652,akeelah_and_the_bee,the film has an important  uplifting message  shame it couldn t be encased in a less faked up story  its clich s seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly  atchison s film relentlessly rams warm fuzzies down your throat and you know what  for all of the cliches and cringe worthy dialogue  i found it nearly impossible to stay mad  
653,namesake,there are bound to be quibbles about whether they get their bengali right or whether nair captures the culture and ethos  but it still can t take much away from this humane  warm and elegantly crafted film  what holds it together are the subtle loving performances by tabu and khan  both bollywoood stars  they never overplay  never spell out what can be said in a glance or a shrug  communicate great passion very quietly  this poignant tale resonates wherever you are placed in the world  there were many moments when i found myself wanting to refer to the book to find out what really happened  the namesake delivers such a tactile presence that it s difficult not to leave feeling as if you ve just struggled through a new york winter  attended an indian wedding  and returned from a calcutta holiday  deserves credit for its graceful attempt to tell an all american story with warm  unromanticized characters trying to discover who they are in a land too eager to impose its own definition on them  
654,maxed_out,do not see this film if you worry about money  maxed out focuses on how much we re in hock without ever really wondering why we need to buy  to maximize your return on this useful report  sit through the end credits where spurlock deposits some of his best material  maxed out doesn t really offer solutions  probably because there are none  but it does a great job of showing how the rich get richer and the poor foot the bill  plus interest  though the movie sometimes feels a bit cursory in telling its many stories  many of its points resonate strongly  in that hey how come i didn t know that way that the best muckraking journalism can do  all the film provides is this bulletin  lefties are angry about the things lefties are angry about  chiefly corporate profits  james scurlock s documentary serves up cautionary tales of epic abuse  though the overall tone is faux cheerful and sometimes genuinely entertaining  especially in the use of clips from an old educational film that looks too fatuous to be faux  scurlock s filmmaking style leans more heavily on woebegone personal testimony than facts and figures  but politicians willing to go up against the credit industry s lobbyists would be well advised to take a look

657,quinceanera,touching  charming and very engagingly played  it offers perceptive insights into la latino culture as well as solid  slightly old fashioned entertainment  co writer directors richard glatzer and wash westmoreland have crafted a small gem  one of those movies from which you emerge feeling happier about the human condition  
658,the_beauty_academy_of_kabul_2006,most of the students had suffered or witnessed horrific abuses and crimes under the taliban  yet the film shows two fatuous u s  instructors who clearly missed the sensitivity training  a spiny  puzzling and highly entertaining film  and whatever you go into it thinking  you re likely to come out thinking something else  any film that raises this many interesting questions is worth seeing  though beauty academy never goes quite deep enough to become essential  this movie shows us a small bit of daily life as lived by real people  for that alone  we should be grateful  director liz mermin subtly captures both sides of a cultural divide  audiences will come away having had an authentic encounter with the plight  the hope and the humanity of the women of afghanistan  and that s more than audiences will ever get just watching the news  an example of fascinating material that frequently triumphs over its pedestrian presentation  surprisingly  the beauty academy of kabul provides equal insight into both cultures  showing how excessive  self obsessed disconnect can shape a culture as strongly as a hideously intruding reality  mermin is quite skilled at separating the honorable intent of the school from dopey assumptions of several american beauticians  there s great charm  and also discomfort  in watching these highly motivated  excited women learn the tricks of a trade practiced very differently from their own  and casually swap horror stories of life under the taliban  this quirky documentary about a group of american hairdressers who establish exactly that shows that the power of hair salons should never be underestimated  the film s unforgettable stars are the beauty academy s students  women who have survived tribal warfare  soviet invasion  muslim tyranny  american bombs  patriarchal families and even western good intentions with extraordinary grace and fortitude  mermin s straightforward  no frills account of how a group of american hair stylists taught their craft to afghan women recently emerging from taliban rule is admirably solicitous toward both teachers and students  
659,el_aura,a fuzzy attempt at significance that seems as aimlessly lost in the woods as its heist plotting characters  the movie s mood is haunting  and its central image of a man able to shed his morality as easily as an old raincoat hints at a filmmaker who had deeper concerns than mere thrills  the aura holds together as a dreamy variation on reservoir dogs  heist gone wrong fatalism and the know thyself confrontations of david mamet s homicide

661,old_joy,subdued  artistic  with beautifully nuanced performances that are as true as they are often elusive of commercial triumph  you would be perfectly at liberty to find it boring and empty  but also to understand the tiny resonances that have made it one of the best reviewed films of 2006 in america  somehow it does strike home  notable for its visual beauty  its melancholic yo la tengo score and its subtle performances  it s an impressively understated and sensitively observed work  such watchful reticence takes a bold  confident filmmaker  making exceptional use of stillness and silence  this is a rather sad study of the passing of traditional concepts of american masculinity along with the landscape that forged them  the characters stayed with me  and i m glad i took a second look now that it s opening for a two week run at northwest film forum  this time around  its sense of humor seemed much more effective    as did its less is more style  old joy is an accurately observed slice of that moment between postadolescence and parenthood  when friends cling or scatter  and circumstances force buried feelings to the fore  like a great jazz musician  reichart understands that striking a single  well placed note can resonate more profoundly than playing a splashy cascade of noise just because you can  fresh as spring water and warm as sunlight  it steeps us in the beauties we will always miss  if we keep dividing the world into winners and losers  the movie explores the increasingly coarse line between nostalgia and acceptance for the way things are  without exclamatory revelation and uproarious self pity  it s sideways for realists  slow moving but ultimately quite touching  
662,this_film_is_not_yet_rated,the same story in print would move more fleetly and makes its points more adroitly  
663,lenfant_2006,l enfant deals in matters of  organized  crime and punishment without compromising its emotional acuity or spiritual purity  l enfant shows a world that remains under the radar for most people  yet proves that growing up   however long it takes   is anything but child s play  unfolding in real time on the scruffy working class streets of industrial belgium  this harrowingly intense odyssey charts bruno s desperate search for redemption  absolutely terrific  a simple moral fable told with compassion and nerve  an observant and effective study in character and setting  suitably grave and distinctively realized  no one is likely to leave l enfant unaffected by the dardennes incisive exploration of the consequences of a world where some of its citizens have found a way to rationalize  and even ignore  what was if not unimaginable  at least unforgivable  here is a film where god does not intervene and the directors do not mistake themselves for god  it makes the solutions at the ends of other pictures seem like child s play  renier is a tiger  clawing into the character with teeth filed to razor sharpness only to have the weight of his morally heinous decisions dull them to cub like nubs  everything about l enfant feels devastatingly real  
664,mutual_appreciation,bujalski has a logical eye for parsing casually unfolding events with visual coherence  and his dryly satirical view of grownups  fatuities doesn t lose sight of the charming vanity of youthful illusions  i bet andrew bujalski is sick of reading that he s the voice of his generation  when most of that neo slacker demographic has never had the opportunity to see his films  you ll either be bored or fascinated by the cassavetes like reality of it all  bujalski perfectly skewers what you might call the  sort of  generation  educated  mid 20s white americans hemmed in by their own non committal uncertainty  just because you shoot semi improvised scenes in black and white doesn t mean you re the new jim jarmusch  despite their lackadaisical impression  the pictures are quite tightly structured  each scene covers emotional and narrative distance  funny  forgiving  credible and deft  they offer much to appreciate  alan  lawrence and ellie  intersecting here and there with a circle of acquaintances and strangers  insinuate themselves into the viewer s heart like good friends  the film s mood and style are pitched somewhere between  60s american indie and french new wave and  as you watch these people  they seem painfully  amusingly on target  the movie is made of small moments  they add up in your mind to something bigger later  the way life does outside of movies  mutual appreciation appropriates a seemingly improvised v rit  style that s ideal for a cast of characters of no tremendous ambition  there is no denying the director screenwriter s ability to capture a certain real life quality on film  you can t exactly call it progress  but it is thrilling  in a low key sort of way  to see real young adults looking and acting the way they do  light years away from the toothy flesh bots that have supplanted them on screen  
665,sweet_land,nostalgic  gentle  loving  the elegiac mood set against endless rural space inevitably suggests malick s days of heaven  what next from this considerable talent  pleasant surprise of the week  a us indie so unashamedly romantic about pie  cornfields  family and baseball you could be forgiven for thinking you were watching a presidential campaign video  a film of uncommon grace  one that transports you to an america that seems innately familiar even though you have never seen it depicted on screen quite like this before  sweet land is an unusual look at love and how it can unexpectedly develop  those for whom the concept of an arranged marriage is foreign will get a little history lesson on the immigrant experience watching this sweetly engrossing film  
666,kraska-v-nesnazich-beauty-in-trouble,while this seems like familiar territory  in the hands of director jan hrebejk and his longtime screenwriting partner  petr jarchovsk  it s an engrossing  layered story of the ill fitting choices and compromises everyone makes  beauty in trouble uses another kind of catastrophe to reveal the true nature of its central characters  impressive for its mastery  intelligence  and ambition in juggling intricate plot strands and memorable characters  this is the kind of film that achieves one simple but difficult thing  it pleases you  comedy and chemistry make for an intoxicating mix in this acerbic  knowing character study from czech director jan hrebejk and screenwriter petr jarchovsky  deeply affecting and darkly amusing  this being a czech film  drama  comedy  history  and social commentary are served up in equal proportion  beauty in trouble offers a meditation on the legacies of communism and the lure of capitalism  but also on the human need for love  connection and family  a vivid  nuanced and sweetly forgiving study in moral ambiguity  beauty in trouble uses the changing moods of water as both metaphor and frame for the infinite adaptability of human emotions  will marcela  wonderful ana geislerova  opt for brains or brawn  the answer might surprise you  unfortunately  hrebejk settles for unsatisfying allusions to the czech experience that never break through the thick haze of melodrama to make his case with any conviction  so  can anyone tell me what the czech word for magnolia is  
667,air_guitar_nation,there must be better  more useful ways of amusing themselves but obviously none which would allow them to strut the stage to the plaudits of a baying crowd like latter day rock stars  
668,paprika,kon rarely cares about the stagnant old real world that his films so frequently transcend  his characters fuss endlessly about fantasy s gripping  consuming power  but he himself seems blissfully unconcerned with where his gorgeous illusions take them  
669,tsotsi,the audience gasps in that odd mixture of surprise and recognition that great story telling affords  it is a first peek at a south africa that doesn t need a hollywood studio or hollywood stars to present itself to the world  or to come to grips with itself at home  what tsotsi fails to explain is how the mere introduction of a baby can melt the cruel cycle of criminality and disregard for others  with lively pacing  superb performances and a candid yet forgiving heart  hood has created an inverse fairy tale that is never less than absorbing  unfolds in such clear eyed  powerful fashion that its characters become unforgettable  and the movie lands a big time emotional punch  the picture can be squishy and obvious  yet it works  thanks to gavin hood s straightforward  sensitive direction and his star s emotionally charged performance  this deceptively simple movie brings to mind italian neo realist classics of the 1940s  and presley chweneyagae  an amateur actor  is wholly convincing as the disoriented tsotsi  it lays a stark narrative that s devoid of sentimentality but stoked with emotional power  without getting maudlin  it will tear you to shreds  it is to  director gaven  hood s credit that he does not over sentimentalize tsotsi s story  nor does he glamorize thug life like so many american films do  we re not used to bad guys with redeeming qualities  and that makes tsotsi as disquieting as it is intriguing  for all its dark edges  tsotsi comes with a silver lining making it worthy of its squirmy ride  chweneyagae skulks with awesome menace  a cauldron of simmering rage and frustration and a performance of real skill  carrying the film effortlessly through to the nail shredding conclusion  that director gavin hood  who wrote the script from a novel by playwright athol fugard  could get you to care so much is a mark of the heart that went into making the film  
670,little_children,the film displays a certain kinship with sam mendes s american beauty  but field is more tragedian than social satirist  well acted and meticulously crafted  little children can feel less like a full blooded representation of life than a disquieting literary exercise  i didn t like any of these characters  but i kept pulling for them anyway    right up to the shock o riffic ending  when i felt i d been sucker punched  as in field s first film  the characters are drawn with such compassion their follies become our own and their desires seem as vast as the night sky  little children includes all the clich d scenarios of a midday tv sudser  but they re ratcheted up several seedy degrees  the bulky melodrama spreads throughout the last half of the film like an acrid and unromantic miasma or like the shards of shattered marriage vows cast helter skelter into an unknowable future  sure to raise heckles in the tabloid press  this is complex  thought provoking cinema  little children slowly loses its grip  becoming just another story about infidelity  albeit an exceptionally polished  well acted one  it s a beautifully insightful story co written by field and tom perrotta  based on his novel  that is sometimes unsettling but always engrossing  and ultimately heart warming  there are plenty of laughs and plenty of shocks  though  and plenty of shifts of narrative viewpoint within the ensemble to keep you on your toes  the unrestrained  and rather excellent  trailer for todd field s little children would have us believe that the whore of babylon  possibly kate winslet  is coming for us on nj transit  with pandora s box in hand  seldom these days does one encounter such an intricate narrative so persuasively performed by the entire cast  most notably by ms  winslet and mr  wilson as the adulterous lovers  filled with moments of painful revelation  real comedy and emotional insight  a small wonder of a movie that puts its characters in playground swings and then gives them a push  watch them fly this way and that  dangling between peril and ecstasy  and see if you don t recognize yourself  
671,bamako_2007,unlike other recent films about the plight of africa  bamako channels its outrage more directly  yet with greater subtlety  by recruiting real life witnesses to africa s economic crises  dramatic features born and bred on the african continent are rare commodities on these shores  and the opportunities they offer can stretch far beyond film appreciation and into the realm of world understanding  trial movies can be painful  but bamako is a powerful polemic leavened with moments of beauty and humor   director  sissako somehow manages to reconcile the passionate words of the debate and the mundane activities surrounding it  but he seems most interested in noting and even marveling at the subtle comedy of their coexistence  there are countless moments that are subtly transfixing  even seemingly casual shots   of vendors peddling knock off gucci glasses  policemen flirting with local women  a man attached to a drip lying alone in a room   linger in the imagination  abderrahmane sissako makes no pretence at neutrality with this indictment of globalised capitalism  the central conceit is audacious  but the film feels oddly slack and inert  livened only by testimony better suited to another forum  heated speeches about the international monetary fund  debt relief and global responsibility may not sound like your idea of friday night entertainment  but  director  sissako makes a strong case  credit  director  sissako for entertainingly blending serious international issues with the daily comings and goings of village life  much of the nearly two hour film consists of impassioned but lengthy speeches about interest rates  deficits  poverty and corruption  this is no way to entertain an audience  so sissako throws in a few hastily drawn characters and a threadbare plot  
672,dreamgirls,neither thought provoking nor entertaining enough   remains largely average and underwhelming  
673,10006485-black_gold,guaranteed to make you think twice about what you re paying for what you re drinking  
674,come_early_morning,if and when come early morning ever resurfaces on dvd  order it immediately and while you re at it  order chasing amy too  if you haven t already seen it  and enjoy a dandy double feature with two country girls of enormous talent  this is a quietly powerful film about small town southern living that avoids all the usual clichs and makes us feel as if we re dropping in on real lives in mid stream  falls prey to bits of psychoanalytic shorthand and narrative predictability  but it offers the rare  meaty role for an actress in her late 30s  judd s delicate portrayal draws a pointed distinction between lucy s volatile disposition and her genuine independence  
675,brick,the teens in rian johnson s striking debut feature brick express themselves in jargon that sounds as if lifted straight from the pages of dashiell hammett and raymond chandler  the self consciously mannered rat a tat tat dialogue also mines a neat overlap between teen slang and noir patois  both of which can be indecipherable to non initiates  it s great to see joseph gordon levitt  mysterious skin  in the juicy role of a high school gumshoe on the trail of his estranged girlfriend s killers  never really offers an adequate justification for its central genre transplant conceit  brick drops down like a frenzied teen fever dream of criminal patter and hairpin plot turns  a word to the wise  pay attention  or you ll feel a lot less wise  there s no denying that brick is weirdly expressive  often when it seems most artificial  what begins as the most gimmicky sort of genre retread somehow evolves into that most elusive of films  a personal statement  it is possible to leave brick without fully appreciating how all the pieces fit together  but still satisfied by a well crafted tale undertaken by a director who pays homage to a film tradition in a truly original way  
676,superman_returns,strictly for fans on school vacation  
677,sketches_of_frank_gehry,the result is a persuasive movie which proves beyond doubt that at least some geniuses are intensely practical as well as intuitive  if sketches of frank gehry fails to reconcile these extroverted buildings with their apparently introverted maker  it offers some heartfelt appreciation  
678,priceless,there s no froth like french froth  and few french froth purveyors are as adept as pierre salvadori  a pleasant little piece of puffy french pastry reminiscent of many other pleasant little pieces of puffy french pastry  bittersweet comedy s perfectly chosen multigenerational cast ably demonstrates that if money can t buy love  it sure can purchase lots of obsequious service from four star hotel staffers and costly goodies from laughably pricey boutiques  the outcome is never much in doubt  but salvadori artfully choreographs the endless table turning  and the moroccan born elmaleh capitalizes on his striking resemblance to buster keaton with a similarly comic composure  the routines may have been done a thousand times  but somehow they seem funny all over again  this broadly amoral take on breakfast at tiffany s suffers from a serious case of who should we care for  he s a sap  she s a soulless vamp  their patrons are either cruel  self deluding or both  the perfect frothy fantasy for the obscene wealth gap era  priceless  hors de prix  stars a gorgeous  cellophane thin audrey tautou as ir ne  a dedicated gold digger who finds herself accidentally mixed up with a penniless bartender  forget reality shows exalting american gluttony and savor the more refined amenities on the coasts of southern france in the cynical gallic comedy priceless  
679,district_b13,a message based actioner that s fast  dumb fun  i was delighted by the balletic and acrobatic stunts  some of which evoke tarzan  the cast hurls itself into the comic book violence  while the stunt choreography and razor sharp editing are exhilarating  as 85 minute testosterone binges go  you could do a whole lot worse  instantly forgettable  but hugely entertaining for 85 minutes  what district b13 lacks in story development it compensates for with stunningly realistic action  district b13 doesn t waste time with fake personality clashes  both lead actors are amazingly fluid athletes  and during the many getaway and shoot  em up sequences  there is a minimum of special effects or wire choreography  the typically moronic plot simply gets in the way of what might have been a super ambitious sneaker commercial  real life events have overtaken district b13  and they give this feverish  yet oddly flat french action adventure a whiff of substance to go along with its spectacular stunts  the creator of films such as the transporter  the fifth element and la femme nikita can be counted on for movies that are big  stupid and often just skillfully demented enough to be fun  district b13 obliges on all accounts  who hasn t wanted to leap down a stairwell  bounce from rooftop to rooftop  do a backflip over a bad guy  give him a few chop socky blows and then take away his gun  the french made  futuristic adrenaline pumper district 13 doesn t really grab you by the short hairs until it shows you why david belle is the movie s star  
680,rocky_balboa,i know  i know  you re thinking  oh please  not rocky again  i was thinking that too  like its odds defying hero  rocky balboa is the biggest surprise of the holiday season  stallone wanted this movie to restore dignity to his greatest character  he succeeds  better then anyone might have expected  the ol  lug can t be blamed for wanting one last victory lap  but if you ve got nothing to offer except benign nostalgia  just let the gloves stay on the glory days shelf  the film meanders along this path for a long  slow while  a primitive soap opera dressed up as street poetry  the unfortunate effect is that of an invisible angel of death hooking rocky s mouth with a fishing line and implacably reeling him in  even goodwill can t make this look like anything more than a glorified tv special  surely it s time for the audience to throw in the towel  it is a good movie  solid entertainment perfect for a cold winter s afternoon  and for all my initial reticence now that i ve watched it i can t wait to climb back into the ring for a second time  touchingly nostalgic  the sixth chapter in the saga of sylvester stallone s eternal underdog packs a far more powerful punch than anyone would have expected  rocky balboa scores a split decision  a familiar start  some flat footed middle rounds and a solid  flailing finish  nothing that happens here is particularly touching  exciting or funny

685,the_year_my_parents_went_on_vacation,this brazilian coming of age drama  co produced by city of god creator fernando meirelles  charms because it rarely spells things out  be patient and brace yourself for the climax  the wait is definitely worthwhile  the year my parents went on vacation seems to be about  in the end  is big time sport as the opiate of the masses  this nuanced coming of age drama by cao hamburger exudes warmth without getting mired in nostalgia  this 1970 set tale of a 12 year old shaped by three driving forces  his country s brutal dictatorship  his left wing parents  disappearance and a nation s obsession with the world cup  pulls you into a well observed world and its characters  director cao hamburger s decision to capture the era through mauro s eyes makes the world outside of soccer vague and frustrating a sweet and somber film that works hard to overcome its limitations  i found the film fascinating for showing me entertainingly a world i still know very little about  mauro s character is underwritten  but michel joelsas delivers a believable  pained lad capable of still being a child  
686,v_for_vendetta,in the face of this film something adolescent in me surged to the surface and i mean that as a great compliment  adolescence is a state i hold in high regard  speaking of love  things go blooey instead of gooey whenever heroine and hero come close enough to touch  far from being sensual  let alone erotic  the movie proves to be not much fun at all  this is just darkness played bright  a disposable object but hardly objectionable  just when we were ready to give up mainstream movies as braindead along comes the controversial and gleefully subversive v for vendetta  a piece of corporate sponsored art that will have audiences rooting for a bomb throwing anarchist  whether you re mindless or mensa  you ll find stuff here to challenge and trouble you  the way a good piece of speculative fiction should  in its ambition to weld a political message onto a comic book movie it falls rather pitifully between two stools  alan moore may be greatest victim of hollywood s comic book adaptation craze  by the movie s midpoint  the wachowski brothers  screenplay has gotten so bogged down in back story that it takes 40 minutes for director james mctiegue to get back to the explosions that his 16 year old target audience assumes will solve everything  feels far too starched and clean to do its source material justice  an unbearably talkative affair with virtually nothing sane to say  
687,riding_alone_for_thousands_of_miles,a father takes a spiritual journey from japan to china to help mend a decades long rift between himself and his dying son  the lessons learned en route are as profound as they are simple  relatively speaking  minor yimou  yet it retains that extraordinary cinematic sensibility and superbly observed humanity that characterizes all his work  in riding alone for thousands of miles his characters use digital communication appliances to send beautiful sentiments  using old school celluloid  so does zhang  the film is simple bordering on sentimental bordering on sloppy  yet it s kept in artistic check by the vast backdrops of china s remote yunnan province and by takakura s nearly wordless performance  
688,taxidermia,it breaks taboos with an insouciance that makes last tango look like mary poppins  
689,transamerica,writer director duncan tucker does little to develop his narrative setup beyond the basic and obvious  and his film begins to feel more like an exercise than a fully realized story  an abrupt but unforgettable movie with rough edges that lend it even more resonance  it sometimes suggests a john waters drag farce trying to go mainstream and sentimental  
690,the_devil_wears_prada,anne hathaway is patricia field s latest fashion victim in this limp semi satire  a lightweight chick flick that  despite gaping plot holes  will likely be a favorite of anyone who adores pretty women in pretty clothes  single handedly  streep lifts prada from adequate chick flick into intoxicating character study  
691,happy_feet,stands at the very top of the 2006 animated kid s film class  director george  babe  miller has pulled off a coup with this one  he s raised the benchmark to a whole new level  both visually and conceptually  bravo  small kids will love the waddlesome dancing and colourful animation  but older viewers will likely be disturbed by the story s darker elements  it s going to take some time before i can look at the snowy breast of a penguin without imagining that it contains the tap tapping heart of a sammy davis jr  was i enchanted  entertained or even diverted for its 108 minute running time  not really  a bewildering combination of anthropomophic perversity and environmental polemic  all scored to cheesy pop hits  entertaining while you re watching it  on reflection  though  it feels a bit like a shell game in which the conjuror himself has lost track of where the pea is supposed to be  happy feet is the kind of musical comedy that might have swept the world if mgm had been based in antarctica instead of culver city  the dazzling animation  catchy songs and broadway worthy dance numbers give the film even broader appeal  imagine march of the penguins with a pop soundtrack  or maybe an inconvenient truth with al gore doing his best donald o connor impression  it s quite the mash up  as intended  and it s cooler than a south pole skinny dip  an ambitious  sporadically intriguing  occasionally hilarious but weird pastiche of grab bag references to pop culture history  don t little ones have enough to worry about without ecological concerns popping up in family entertainment  happy feet should have stayed light on its feet  
692,exiled,this flamboyant  peckinpah ish ode to male bonding has a melancholy  fin de si cle splendor  this tale of childhood buddies turned hit men is the kind of film where flames roar  waves crash and dropped bullets thud like bowling balls  one of those wearisome hong kong action movies where characters engage in mexican standoffs not so much to ratchet up excitement or generate tension but rather to look cool for as long as possible

694,cars,cars is pixar s most improbable success to date  a film that could easily have misfired  but somehow does not  rips off doc hollywood  almost note for note  judged against previous form  this is not pixar firing on all cylinders  lacking the sophisticated comedy we ve come to expect  judged against fare from other studios  however  it s a triumph  it had to end sometime  after a run of standard setting cgi movies  pixar has finally delivered a dud  i m wondering if the piston cup conceit of huge crowds of cars watching fellow cars race around a track crashing is perverse in a  they shoot horses  don t they   sort of way  along came the interstate  apparently  and ruined everything  just like that darned internet  i guess  or that superhighway stuff  or those dumb movies they make with computers nowadays  cars might get us into car world as a gimmick  but it doesn t get us into car world as a state of mind  thus  the animation  rather than seeming like an expression of the movie s deeper truth  becomes an impediment to it  cars made me want to hop in my jalopy and to head out to route 66  bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the mother road redundant  it achieves the near impossible  turning cars  trucks  tractors and farm harvesters into cute disney characters whose fates you ll care about  it thunders ahead with breezy abandon  scoring big grins on its way  for parents out there whose future holds the certain prospect of the dvd version blaring repeatedly from family room screens  let this by your advisory  warning  cars comes unequipped with two essential options    charm and a good muffler  
695,over_the_hedge,an endearingly cheerful animated feature from dreamworks  
696,house_of_sand,cinematographer ricardo della rosa     has created images of rare beauty in the midst of terrain so spectacularly strange that it sometimes seems to speak a language all its own  visually dazzling  epic in its sweep and deeply romantic in its sensibility  the house of sand is one of those films whose images and ideas linger long after the lights come on  having been burned into the viewer s consciousness  a visual work of art and its simple story moves as effortlessly as the sands in a forsaken desert in northern brazil  it ends up like an impressionist painting without a subject  one we stare at longingly  waiting for its purpose to emerge  the tone can be hypnotic and the pacing requires some patience  just give in to the film s rhythms and you ll find that you re different walking out than you were walking in  sometimes mesmerizing  sometimes tedious  always superbly acted  soarez isn t really saying much with house of sand  beyond marveling at the quirks of fate brought on by time  but the acting keeps it from floating into the ether  if you let yourself get swept up in its ravishing imagery  and if you can accept its largely non verbal poetic conceits  it sticks to you like grains of the substance that gives it its name  in many senses  the movie is of a piece with the great  sudsy throwaway women s dramas from ancient hollywood  the images of the coastal desert of maranho in northern brazil are as beautiful to look at in andrucha waddington s movie as the lives of her characters are hard to live  if david lean and william faulkner had ever collaborated  and brought in henry moore to do set design  house of sand might have been their troubling brainchild  
697,monster_house,set on halloween  the script is original and nicely creepy  even when the boys are joined by a redhead named jenny  a bracingly icy breath of fresh air  a tween oriented family film that is unabashedly out to frighten  an excursion into primal fears of places you don t want to walk past at night  while it might not bring the house down  there s enough here to suggest this monster won t be moving out of cinemas any time soon  ultimately  the environments are far more interesting than the humans navigating within them  monster house benefits from strong graphic design and lovely lighting  but the script is nothing to write home about  until this animated horrorfest turns shrill  debuting director gil kenan delivers enough visual goods to justify the faith of producers steven spielberg and robert zemeckis  the difference between monster house and most other animated movies is a little thing called story  it actually has one  and doesn t just trot out cheeky characters spewing gratuitous pop culture references  it s part story and part spectacle  with the two halves being nicely balanced to offer something for just about everyone  an enjoyable ride on a dark but not quite scary enough to make you scream roller coaster  told in elegant motion capture animation  the movie treats children with respect  monster s pre teens are sarcastic  think they re smarter than their parents and are going crazy over the opposite sex  
698,10004925-matador,nice characters and situations  unfortunately  writer director richard shephard didn t have much idea where to go with them  never as good as you d hoped or as bad as you d feared  the matador is one of those of up and down experiences  it s painful to watch as the movie basically destroys itself in the second half  slipping from its elegant thriller setup to tired sitcom shenanigans  unevenly paced yet darkly funny and consistently intriguing  this edgy little movie may not cut as sharply as a killer s knife  but it carves out a very diverting niche all the same  writer director richard shepard s movie is just a sweet  broadly made buddy picture that happens to look a lot like an almodovar production  
699,us_vs_john_lennon,if anything this film proves that song can have more impact than a little toe tapping and tub thumping  the aim may be laudable  but nothing gets hit except some awfully tired targets  and fatigue doesn t resonate

705,bourne_ultimatum,if it feels like a non stop demolition derby  at least there s a responsible driver at the wheel  the british director paul greengrass makes everything seem more plausible with twitchy camerawork and even twitchier editing  i m sure a lot of people will find it thrilling  me  i just wanted to get headache  or  seasickness tablets  while the crunchy fights and unflagging pace ensure this delivers as genre spectacle  the muddy ethics also make for a pleasing contrast with standard issue wham bammery  greengrass comes full circle from the war on terror film that bit its tongue to the popcorn flick that speaks volumes  as good as the first two films were  as well as they redefined the action espionage thriller  the third film falls victim to its own innovation  a rattling yarn exuberantly told  crunchingly violent but not too sadistic  our hero is the ferocious but amnesiac cia tough guy jason bourne played by matt damon  the contours of whose rock hard pecs are traced by his drum tight t shirt  it s the role that turned this moon faced boy into a man  there is nothing cheap about the bone shattering beauty of his car smashes  or the pitch perfect symphonies of shattering glass  a heart pounding  merciless thrill ride that will leave you gasping for breath  watching the bourne ultimatum is like being strapped to a vibrating bed set on high for two hours in a cheap motel  the payoff bourne fans have been waiting for  a great action movie  exhilarating and neatly crafted  the kind of picture that will still look good 20 or 30 years from now  
706,juno,a smart yet sensitive film  more a coming of age drama with believable american youngsters rather than tv perfect beverly hills types    just a lovely  lovely film which asks for nothing  ellen page s performance is the key to juno s journey  and she unerringly nuances her character s blithe self assuredness with just the right notes of uncertainty and innocence  screenwriter diablo cody and director jason reitman make juno the marvelously un still center of a wistfully acerbic comedy that qualifies as a feminized version of knocked up  a sharp edged  sweet centred  warm hearted coming of age movie that s always just that little bit smarter than you think it is  reitman has delivered a bundle of joy  juno may look like knocked up s kid sister  but it bests it on all fronts from jokes to emotional insight  juno isn t a film made in the bell jar of unlikely reality that is  far too often  hollywood  it s a film whose attention to real life detail is so fine  audiences will be hopelessly and happily lost in its story from the first frame  
707,persepolis,persepolis is worth every second of its superb 100 minutes  kind of interesting and is kind of original but its telling moments are told so often it s like going out to dinner and being served the same course over and over  you could ask for a more hardcore adaptation of her bitterly funny  sad and angry book  i think  but not for a more enjoyable one  an exuberant autobiographical film and dark horse contender for an animated feature oscar  the film s nuanced view of social issues is complemented by lovely black and white animation work that blends islamic motifs into a sort of yellow submarine ish world  it s striking how much emotion satrapi is able to convey through these blocky drawings  which are simple but powerfully chosen   i t s that balance of quotidian personal struggles taking place alongside the larger scope of political upheaval and repression that makes persepolis such a riveting film  the predominantly black and white animation is used to amusing effect as satrapi gently pokes fun at her youthful exuberance and innocence  making serious political points easy to swallow  the lack of sense of direction is the film s only let down  the movie sparkles with witty self awareness  persepolis will prove a worthwhile movie for thoughtful teens  they are likely to discover that their plight may be universal  but their circumstances are always unique  and  oh yeah  the personal is always political

712,the_diving_bell_and_the_butterfly_2007,nothing in director julian schnabel s career so far has anticipated the sweetness  sadness  maturity and restraint of this lovely movie  an exquisite metaphor for the redemptive power of cinema  without an ounce of cheap sentiment  this true story is as profoundly moving and dreamily beautiful as any film in recent memory  director julian schnabel uses his skill as a painter to assemble a collage of fantastical images to reveal the exquisite physical wreck that bauby has become  here is the life force at its most insistent  lashing out against fate with stubborn resolve  and also with lust  hunger  humor and all of the other notes that this man once played so easily  
713,ten_canoes,the particular and universal aspects of myth converge in an often humorous drama that illuminates the indigenous yolngu people yet also echoes creation stories from other cultures  de heer s indigenous action comedy relies on its own puckishness a few times too many  but its tribute to the power of a well spun yarn couldn t be more effective  
714,enchanted,delightful stuff  this large scale disney family film is sheer delight  though the film is full of allusions to the disney canon  they are generally unobtrusive echoes rather than eager satires  this is a children s movie at which adults are also welcome  not a cartoon for grownups  the animated sequences are disappointingly flat  the real life parts underwritten  but amy adams works hard and keeps a straight face in the lead  and the time passes amiably enough  the comic possibilities  once floated  eventually capsize  overhyped family movie covered in a cellophane shrink wrap of corporate disney plastic ness  susan sarandon is terrific as the evil queen  timothy spall pops up like a well used wart  and james marsden is the terrifically thick and handsome prince  it s only when the story hits the streets of nyc and adams starts hamming it up  much like julie hagerty did in  airplane   that we start seeing the fruits of a grand mickey take  for the most part this is a perky delight that takes a cheeky glee in biting the gloved hand that feeds  the dedicated fairy tale fan will have tons of fun spotting all the references  adams  meanwhile  gives one of the comedy performances of the year  enchanted earns its label as a  family film  by virtue of its ability to captivate audience members both young and old  
715,there_will_be_blood,the sprawling  dark epic hinges on atmospherics and the moody air  it s heightened further by the ominous music  especially in the long  wordless opening sequence set in the mines with man pitted against nature  day lewis s performance will simply have you like a fever you can t shift  the landscapes are hard and big  but he scathes through them as if they were no more than your uncle stan s allotment  in a way  there s not a step you haven t seen in classics going as far back as citizen kane  still  there are enough oddities in the details to keep you full of questions  this is a film by paul thomas anderson that has overshot the runway of movie modernity with something thrillingly  dangerously new  it s a biblical parable about america s failure to square religion and greed  but most of all it is a marvellously entertaining soap  a sort dickens does dallas  without the sex or swimming pools  one of the most wholly original american movies ever made  daniel day lewis bestrides the narrow world like a colossus as daniel plainview  a turn of the last century prospector for gold and silver who stumbles upon oil in rural california and goes after it with the ferocity  focus  and ethical sensitivity of a f hypnotic  poetic and often downright strange  the remarkable result is every bit as combustible as the black stuff itself  the moments that linger long after you ve left the theater and forgotten how damned tedious the whole thing was are with paul dano s smug  moon faced preacher 
716,for_the_bible_tells_me_so,progressive clergy provide enough historical context to neutralize the handful of bible verses prohibiting homosexual acts  but karslake never confronts the broader issues of sexuality and procreation that bedevil even moderate christians  its main surprise is the compassion shown toward everyone  on all sides of the debate  it does not vilify those who vilify gays  while the film is unlikely to sway anyone whose mind already isn t made up  it provides plenty food for thought in its examination of biblical doctrine on same sex love and how it resonates to this day  this rational  human and very serious documentary by daniel karslake gets at the historical distortions of the good book as well as the ease with which holy writings have been used in america to propagate hate  more human interest than agitprop  
717,surfwise,the fallout decades later provides the drama in this documentary by doug pray  who lets his eccentric octogenarian subject off a little too easy  the film s director  doug pray  has been able to track down each and every paskowitz child  and he weaves their memories together with old home movies  still photos and news clippings to create an evocative portrait of their lives  some documentarians think like essayists  propagandists  abstract painters  or magazine reporters  doug pray approaches his documentaries as though he s writing books  there are too many unanswered questions and a suspicious forced happy ending  but surfwise is still a fascinatingly voyeuristic and emotionally powerful movie  the movie feels exhaustive in its loaded 90 something minutes  showing and telling us much while leaving the meaning of the tangles and twists in this family open to interpretation  for once  the tip of the iceberg is enough  a mesmerizingly ambivalent documentary about an itinerant family of jewish surfer dude health nuts  what kid wouldn t want to spend every day at the beach instead of in school  well  doug pray s absorbing new documentary suggests that no dream is as ideal as it may seem  surfwise tries to separate itself from the fray of political documentaries by not taking itself too seriously  
718,no_end_in_sight,this is a movie about the very officials who boasted  i don t do quagmires   then defense secretary rumsfeld   but who hadn t actually done the planning or simple reading of other people s plans that might have avoided that very fate  narrated with a detached  grim authority by campbell scott  ferguson s film is surely the most nonhistrionic cinematic explanation of our current geopolitical woes yet seen  its list of interviewees includes a number of insiders once deeply involved in the bungled aftermath of america s invasion of iraq  it also includes some shocking  on the ground footage from the war that has not been seen elsewhere  ferguson is admirably tenacious in assigning blame for the boneheaded mistakes that have doomed iraqi reconstruction  
719,10006630-life_of_reilly,there s a genuine wonderment and breathless joy in reilly s delivery that hints at what a fine stage actor he must have been  particularly when he describes going to a movie for the first time  or his thrill at first getting the lead in the school play  the life of reilly pays fitting homage to a man who deserves to be remembered for much more than just trading double entendres with brett somers on the match game  one could say there are two kinds of people  those who appreciate charles nelson reilly  and those who don t know enough about him  this engaging documentary will charm the former and educate the latter  this charming  bittersweet 90 minute monologue consists of the actor telling tales of his childhood and early years  when he was an ugly duckling from an uglier family  
720,grbavica,the dramatic conflicts are soapy and unsubtle  but karanovic pours intense authority into esma s scarred psyche  
721,du_levande,in less skilful hands  such an enterprise could appear arch and disjointed  but andersson allows certain common visual themes and stylistic ticks to bind the picture together into a profoundly satisfactory whole  you won t know whether to laugh or cry  
722,away_from_her,beautifully written  from an alice munro short story  this movie directed by an actress rarely missteps  even when it bravely includes the dark humor inherent in this situation  superb  from its subtle atmospheres to its fine performances  julie christie is exquisite as ever purveying the spirit of a woman whose radiance remains even as it dims like the glow of sunset on a snowbound lake  as this intimate  beautifully observed film unfolds  you realize that the story s themes are relevant no matter what age you happen to be  sarah polley s sad  wise and simply dazzling directorial effort beams with warmth  away from her deals with a subject that easily could have turned maudlin  but the performances in away from her are pitch perfect throughout  and polley never begs for an emotional response she doesn t try to earn  upon seeing away from her again  i m content with my sense memory  i m even more pleased with how much of this fine film s nuance and detail feel fresh  it s christie who places this powerful love story about the cruelties of aging within hailing distance of leo mccarey s sublime make way for tomorrow  rarely has love at any age been depicted so honestly on screen  for such a fully realized portrait to be created by a 28 year old first time director is even more remarkable  
723,hairspray,i actually can t remember the last time a movie opening made me so cheerful  
724,sicko,sicko is wildly comic while tearing apart the country s health care system  if other countries can provide their people with universal health care  why can t we  if we can t  who are we  moore has again made a film which  though basically sound in logic  sugars the pill in a way which seems suspect in its determination to suggest that  as far as healthcare is concerned  america is bad and everywhere else is good  a devastating exposure of america s iniquitous healthcare system  coolly marshalled and amusingly detailed by moore  if moore were a more radical polemicist  he might have focused squarely on this alarming social injustice  but  perhaps rightly  he sees a broader one  even the insured are handing themselves over to a bewildering lottery  while we all have our grumbles about the nhs  it s hard not to be caught up in moore s righteous indignation on behalf of his countrymen  or not to feel a twitch of pride in our own  metaphorically speaking  it goes straight for the jugular  one may quibble with mr  moore s anecdotal oversimplifications and his xenophilic fantasies  but he has struck a socio psychic nerve in the body politic  generating a feeling of outrage that seems to be reverberating in every theater  in moving away from the dirty arena of polemics  sicko accomplishes something moore has sought for quite some time  coherence  even moore s worst ideological enemies would be hard put to dispute the basic argument of his new film sicko  the american health care system is a sick joke and has been for a very long time  
725,in_the_shadow_of_the_moon,the crowd pleaser has enough ambition to pitch a one size fits all philosophy based on the apollo crew s revelation that looking down from space  our problems seem trivial  respectful  enthusiastic and occasionally rather touching as the men  now in their seventies  recall how it felt up there  yet the really important question never gets asked  what was it all for  stirring stuff  packed with as many beautiful images as portentous outbursts  you probably won t find a more comprehensive document of space exploration on film  david sington more than makes up for the straightforward nature of his film with the quality of its interviews and plenitude of staggering archive footage  this wonderful documentary succeeds as a reminder of human endeavour  the contrast between the near surreal space footage and the down to earth men who were actually in those spacesuits is awe inspiring  there s vibrant visual poetry here  
726,the_host_2007,rarely plays out the way you expect  director bong is careful to deliver the promised scares  but he is also willing to overlook plot formulas to explore his own interests  it s unlike just about any other monster movie i ve ever seen  what a pleasure to watch an ambitious horror film that not only frightens but also surprises and engages us completely with its artful shifting of tones  
727,michael_clayton,clooney s glamorous intelligence is deepened by his constant hints that slickness  like corporate integrity  is just an act  the film doesn t disappoint  it s an enveloping thriller with a cool intelligence  the kind of film redford or newman would have jumped at 15 or 20 years ago  george clooney just keeps getting better and better  his performance here is rich and deep and layered  and seeing him work through his range of reactions is enormously moving  it provides a strong center for the legal thriller swirling around him  smart and exciting  michael clayton takes the audience on a ride whose pleasures almost sneak up on you and are all the more satisfying because of it  a dense trip into the gray areas of the legal world that film fans will go back to again and again like the classics that inspired it  don t miss it  
728,zodiac,downey jr is perfect as the alcoholic wastrel of a crime reporter paul averi  as is mark raffalo as the dependable cop david   w here se7en  with its stygian gloom and theatrical executions  inflated the serial killer genre to gothic proportions  zodiac lets the air back out  it is methodical rather than macabre  clinical rather than cruel  fincher  more subdued     and aching for a return to smart suspense films from the likes of sidney lumet and alan j  pakula  pulls us by the collar into the frame and cranks the sense of menace taut without cheap tricks or cop out gimmicks  david fincher s sixth feature potently blends the dynamics of the newsroom drama with those of the police procedural  gyllenhaal always manages to present a person of some sensitivity without leaning on actorish resources  fincher s most mature work to date will earn respect over time      this gripping character study becomes more agonisingly suspenseful as it gets closer to an answer that can t be confirmed  i don t expect to see a better crime movie this year  several bravura suspense sequences   can t help but recall slasher convention  any honest neurotic could probably tell you  the emotional payoff of an obsession is not attaining some longed for goal    it s the obsession itself  which fulfills certain needs  a modern american masterpiece  
729,hot_fuzz,what will wright and pegg set their targets for next  i don t know  but i ll be watching  only people who have an equal fondness for strolls through english cottage gardens and dirty harry movies are going to fall madly in love with the film  but just about everybody is going to like it  this rude  bodily fluid spattered romp is like the red bull version of every bad buddy police picture a little lethal weapon  a lot of bad boys  and waaaaay too much point break  pegg and wright are armed with an endlessly impressive arsenal of attention grabbers  from witty editing tricks to a wry soundtrack and a joke packed script that demands multiple viewings  overall hot fuzz could use a bit more speed to outrun its demons  
730,knocked_up,    seth rogen and katherine heigl have great chemistry onscreen and they are hysterical together  although this story about a mismatched couple expecting a baby strains credibility and sometimes pushes the limits of good taste  it delivers plenty of belly laughs  if the essence of great comedy is truth then knocked up falls some way short  judd apatow s follow up to the 40 year old virgin is snort all over the person in front of you funny  hand over mouth filthy  and as exhilarating as inhaling from a 10 ton oxygen tank  very funny for an hour  judd apatow s script and direction are finally mugged by a gang worse than any of these  the feelgood moralists  who terrorise all parts of tinseltown  two future parents in their early 20s  hardly even grownups  make a romantic  idealistic wager on the future of their love  apatow pulls off the considerable trick of making us feel protective  even parental towards these people  it s so funny that you ll be snorting popcorn out of your nose before the end  knocked up isn t going to help change the world or anything  but at the very least it may help take one s mind off the relentlessly dismal headlines  i don t know what greater service a mere movie can perform these days  a refreshingly frank  funny odd couple comedy with engaging leads and too many belly laughs to count  hilarious from moment to moment  but leaving behind both a warm glow and a sting  this is a picture that refuses to fetishize either the ability to conceive or the significance of our place in the universe once we ve done so  what makes the movie so winning are its endearing and relatable characters who spout believable dialogue and amusing banter  steeped in clever pop culture references and sharp observations of human nature  it s hard enough to find comedies like this at any time  so it s a small and welcome miracle to come upon one in the midst of a typical movie summer  richer than ever in over budgeted  underwhelming inanities  
731,1195800-my_winnipeg,more an abstract hallucination than a photo realist portrait  my winnipeg would be out of place on the  documentary  shelf at the video store  but it deserves prime placement in the guy maddin canon  maddin mixes personal reminiscences with elaborate fantasies of masonic rituals and collectivist brothels  to construct a vision of winnipeg as a city of sleepwalkers  maddin is a real film maker with a confident  fluent movie language that is evolving in fascinating directions  guy maddin docu about his hometown gives fans everything they d expect  plus a few moments of unexpected sincerity  in the narration maddin claims that winnipeg has ten times as many sleepwalkers as any other city in the world  and though he s surely making this up  it conveys his own sense of entrapment amid the town s dreaminess  if you love movies in the very sinews of your imagination  you should experience the work of guy maddin  for the uninitiated  i heartily recommend this free associative  autobiographical gem  much of what maddin asserts as truth is balderdash  he was not  for example  born in the locker room of the local hockey team s arena  
732,1194818-encounters_at_the_end_of_the_world,this documentary about life in and around a vast scientific research centre in antarctica  none of these meetings  however  is as interesting as the interspersed footage of the pole s natural wonders  seemingly off hand  cumulatively imposing  utterly masterful  as a nature doc alone  encounters at the end of the world would stand as one of the year s best  but it is the people who choose to live and work at the very ends of the earth that are herzog s real subject  it s a thoroughly intelligent  worthwhile and tremendous looking film  but where is the dark spark of herzog magic  almost every film werner herzog makes is savage and incisive  encounters at the end of the world  far out and unforgettable  as a nature documentary it s nothing special  but that was never the intent  as an observational study of people and place  it s truly fascinating  mid list herzog  but still a stimulating  strange experience  and that tragically perverse penguin is the most memorable movie animal of the year  a compelling film that is by turns thought provoking and very funny  wondrous  wow inducing marvels   seal calls that sound weirdly like pink floyd  rare glimpses into the eerily alien underwater universe of exquisite ice cathedrals   uplift the soul as herzog explores his pet obsessions  the film is beautifully shot both under the ice  where creatures roam in a place that would rival any sci fi horror  herzog is one of a kind  his new doc is an event you watch in awe as you marvel at its wonders  herzog  contemporary cinema s most consistently lyrical examiner of the  in human condition  returns to the documentary form in yet another wonderfully improbable locale  antarctica  the literal bottom of the world  the sky is relentlessly blue  the sun bright even in the thick of night  in this odd and unforgettable place  herzog has made his own poetry  a poem of oddness and beauty  herzog is like no other filmmaker  and to return to him is to be welcomed into a world vastly larger and more peculiar than the one around us  the underwater photography alone would make a film  but there is so much more  
733,devil_came_on_horseback,a decent attempt at outling the crises but crucially lacking much depth  with an estimated 400 000 dead since 2003  and 2 5 million sudanese left homeless in the wake of the genocide  ignoring the story doesn t seem like a humane option  an exceptionally powerful film driven by contradictory forces  devil ponders the optimism pessimism   apathy x equation as honestly and studiously as any doc i ve ever seen  
734,up_the_yangtze,there s plenty for the director to focus on  examining the dam s environmental impact alone would take another whole movie  instead   director  yung trains his lens mainly on the cultural impact  in doing so he photographs a landscape and country going through profound change on an almost unimaginable scale  all of it building to a final scene that s chilling in its joseph conrad like uncertainty  its range of subjects and emotions cuts a surprisingly wide swath  filmmaker yung chang finds a sad and beautiful way to glimpse the big picture of dislocation through an exquisitely poised small study  just where is china taking us besides up the yangtze river  mr  yung s film does not even pretend to know  and that is its great strength as it plunges more deeply into the truly unknown  
735,the_counterfeiters_2007,it s details like that too bizarre not to be true that give  the counterfeiters  its bitter wallop  it s an astonishing tale of cunning  compromise and survival  the winner of this year s oscar for best foreign language film puts devils  as well as angels  on the head of the pin  this oscar winning film ranks as the most unnerving  disturbing  true life account yet of endurance under nazi oppression  ruzowitzky has some fine performers in the three key roles but there is a hint of unsubtlety in some of the other characters and situations  the obvious is rammed home  this dark  absorbing thriller is not just a moral exercise in the awful choices faced by those determined to survive history s worst genocide  it invites us to imagine ourselves in the shoes of a not quite lovable rogue  based on a real life nazi operation  the film is a tense drama with performances that elevate the movie to the front rank of films set in concentration camps  turns out to be just as challenging and effective a political drama as persepolis and 4 months  slick  exciting  emotionally trenchant   well done all around  the film does shed light an another facet of nazi history  and it does it with an attention to the complexity of human nature that makes it worthy of its oscar win  a drama based on true historical events that leaves no conscience unchallenged  the trouble is that the storytelling and filmmaking are routine  surely faux documentary handheld camerawork is the most overused cliche in modern movies   even when the human drama is not  
736,election_2,the exposition is perfectly balanced with bloody action and muscular set pieces   director to s  talent for documentary style realism and navigating complex political systems sets him apart  though his nationalism puts him squarely in the mainstream  this remains a well crafted genre movie  and one that promises further developments in its final scene  like the late john frankenheimer  director to marries his drama with action and superb composition to achieve compelling results at times  the movie is familiar on several levels but also has its own engaging style  the director rejuvenates the genre by connecting the dots between a criminal subculture and a much bigger sociological picture  he s finally given hk cinema its very own godfather  like the best crime stories  this one isn t about how the bad guys live  it s about how we live  ready for the godfather with a distinctly hong kong flavor  the surfaces gleam as luxuriously in johnnie to s exemplary gangster thriller triad election as those in a similarly slicked up hollywood film  but the blood on the floor here seems stickier  johnnie to s election 2 is distinguished by intelligence  wit and violence but is lightly wounded by some ill fitting moments  
737,nanking,the lesson here is not simply to vilify the japanese soldiers of that era  but to make sure that we never forget who we are and what our country stands for today  sheds light on particular wartime atrocities largely neglected in the collective memory  nanking doesn t tell us why decency and compassion completely break down from time to time  it just tells us something terribly modern and all too familiar  anyone who sees nanking should know going in what a brutal story it is  but no one should miss it because of a restrictive rating  nanking does justice to this tragedy even though it makes the mistake of mixing the testimony of actual participants with staged readings from actors subbing for real people  the filmmakers employ a powerful technique of interspersing newsreel footage with wrenching on camera interviews of survivors and sequences of actors reciting from the letters and memoirs of the westerners on the scene  i have rarely  if ever  seen a documentary reconstruction of a historical event that is so rich in firsthand  and well preserved  photographic material  a somberly effective look at one of the most shameful events in human history  nanking submits yet another reminder  if any more were needed  of how wickedness in the 20th century achieved dimensions previously considered unimaginable    or unbearable  nanking both calls attention to a horrifying set of war crimes that remains little known in the west and crafts an impossible but true hymn to the power of the individual conscience  indispensable  beautifully crafted account of a little known japanese massacre  the personalities it brings to light    many of whom were forced to remain silent about what they d seen after returning to their homelands    are worthy of widespread exposure  
738,1208_east_of_bucharest,the central european tradition of failed aspirations  lost ideals and forlorn eccentrics goes back to early forman  or indeed chekhov  but the latin romanians bring their own awareness of the distant big city alternately beckoning and frightening  live television going down in flames is always good for a laugh  
739,310_to_yuma,nothing terribly original happens in this remake of a 1957 semi classic that starred glenn ford and van heflin  but everything happens smoothly and with grace   i f you re looking for an unforgiven style reinvention of the western  prepare for disappointment  mangold s film is more than sufficiently subtexty and cynical for our modern sensibilities while simultaneously embracing mangold s obvious pleasure in the westerns  time honored swinging saloon doors and stern masculine traditions  mangold delivers a taut modern take on a lesser classic  preserving the high noon themes about doing the right thing against all odds  and injecting a more modern pacing and urgency without going overboard  a well made movie that isn t as simply expressed as its predecessor and so loses some of its mythic quality  the more you complicate westerns the less effective they often become  new zealand s russell crowe and britain s christian bale  donning the hats and accents to play outlaw and escort with grizzled assurance  a terrific turn by peter fonda  as a leathery bounty hunter hell bent on retribution  is a bonus in a film far livelier than anyone had a right to expect  despite a faintly anti climactic ending  there s plenty of entertainment in this robust  old fashioned western tale  they don t make them like that anymore  but  hang on  they just did  the two leads  sparking byplay  crowe s addled cockiness versus bale s nervy grit  would grace any surroundings  but it s a pleasure to revisit the frontier in a drama which feels far more vital than mere nostalgic homage  at the helm of this remake  james mangold initially risks stalling the plot with too much backstory  but then it s edge of your seat action all the way  crowe and bale are a great study in contrasts  yet the two characters develop a grudging respect for each other that enriches the murky morality play that makes up the last half hour  
740,my_kid_could_paint_that,new york times senior art critic michael kimmelman offers sharp insights when he mentions how marla s painting reflects not just  innocence  and what our psyches project into them  but also  the cynicism of the art world   documentarian amir bar lev began making a film about whether modern art is a scam and whether a 4 year old painter from binghampton  n y   might not be as good as picasso  but bar lev ended making a film instead about whether the 4 year old is a scam  still  this is still awful fascinating stuff at times  and little marla olmstead is easily one of the more singularly beguiling little kids i ve seen grace the silver screen in ages  
741,eastern_promises,despite viggo s total gorgeousness  a nude fight for his life in a steam room has all the titillation of a butcher throwing down a slab of meat  cronenberg is his own master  still ready to throw in the sort of scene few other directors could dare  accents are as thick as borscht  and vodka flows almost as freely as the blood  an instant cult classic  it s a role that mortensen inhabits with great elan  with hair slicked back  a cigarette clamped in the corner of his mouth and a sardonic glint in his eye  he looks as if he s earned every inky stain  slightly hesitant  slightly undercharacterised and gently compromising  hybrid  an oddly diplomatic  if often brutal  dip into the hellish demi mondes lurking behind bouncer guarded london doorways  mortensen shines but a contrived  issue driven plot destabilises what could have been a great russian gangster movie  here is an excellent crime thriller made with grown ups in mind  eastern promises is a straightforward  straight up russian gangster movie whose primary achievement is making the russian gangster underworld feel exotic and menacing  suffice it to say it s a bit of primal brutality that lays bare the animal in each of us  fighting to survive  
742,this_is_england,its tough but moving neo realist approach make it one of the better british films of recent times  somewhere between the pop jouissance of guy ritchie and the social realism of ken loach  this ballsy drama freeze frames bleak thatcherite yorkshire and exposes its racist underbelly  don t expect a history lesson  shaun s story is more than enough to grab and hold your attention  
743,savages,while writer director tamara jenkins  slums of beverly hills  lets things get a little mushy towards the end  the film brilliantly portrays a difficult family moment made even more complicated by her characters  overweening narcissism  jenkins  superlative work proves her first film was no fluke  let s hope it doesn t take another nine years to hear from her again  a richly nuanced american comedy  with two acting talents working at their absolute peak  it s just a shame the script doesn t push the humour further  brief  amusing put downs aren t quite enough to make this a bonafide comedy  but if you re looking for a well performed drama about dementia  you ve got it  the savages not only boasts oscar worthy performances from philip seymour hoffman and laura linney as a self absorbed brother and sister  its attention to detail makes it sweetly funny and genuine  smartly written and beautifully played  
744,rescue_dawn,herzog s planted rather too firmly in his discomfort zone  but bale once again confirms himself as one of our most intense  committed and watchable actors  like taking a family holiday to the dordogne  sure it looks good but haven t we been here before  herzog builds this movie around another strong  eccentric performance from bale  who is gaining a reputation for outsized talent and for downsized physicality  although the film delivers the expected action and efficiently jacks up the suspense  longtime devotees of the director will undoubtedly miss the visionary qualities that have long distinguished his work  it s easy to understand why herzog was driven to tell this story twice  that heart stopping beginning tells us herzog is again in top form  richly depicting the true story of the only american pow known to have escaped from laotian captivity  
745,lake_of_fire,at 152 minutes  his film doesn t seem long  because at every moment something absorbing  disturbing  depressing or infuriating is happening  provides gruesome  incontrovertible images to complement its deliberations about morality  wherever you stand on the volatile issue of abortion  tony kaye s exhaustive documentary could dislodge your certainties with a broad survey of opinion from opposite extremes and explicit depictions of medical procedures  
746,superbad,honest goodwill  fond observational detail and greg mottola s exuberant direction make the picture nigh on irresistible  but there are some missteps  what makes the film so appealing is the disconnect between what comes from the mouths of these hormone addled pups and what s going on in their heads  where they re still clinging desperately to the innocence they re leaving behind   cera  has some of the best comic timing of anyone working in film today  a precocious sense of the awkward pauses and misread cues in which social panic resides  if you can stand the predatory assumptions  which are that girls are mere sex objects to most teenage boys  there s much more to this movie than the usual teen comedy  you can t help laughing even as you wince  it s a film that makes american pie seem sophisticated  and it will have cultural critics shaking their heads and muttering about the death of western civilization  i loved it  there are some excruciatingly funny moments but there are perhaps not as many laughs as you would hope for given the script s comedy pedigree  it s as if mike leigh decided to make a gross out comedy  doesn t quite have the insight of a classic  but it ll have you smirking for weeks   superbad  at its best goes right through knockabout to land in deliciously obscene places   notably a staggering succession of doodles in which tumescent cocks take on various extraordinary guises  the main idea behind superbad is to put all the stupid things boys and girls do into one night of mayhem  most of it is fuelled by drink and hormones and nearly all of it is from life  
747,waitress,shelly deftly achieves a tone pitched between fantasy and reality  its levity belying an astute and humane study of an unhappy relationship steeped in inertia  waitress is not a perfectly cut  factory line safeway brand slice  it does  though  serve up a generous deep dish portion  homemade and heartfelt  that leaves a sweet taste goes down  the sunniness of its tone is so disarming that it keeps you onside no matter what  you ve heard of my big fat greek wedding  this is my big thin white abusive marriage  despite getting off to a good start with an entertaining premise  waitress ultimately promises more than it delivers  thanks to its less than satisfying final act  a predictably syrupy feel good finale that the film could well have done without  an unassuming treat amid the noisy blockbuster season  it ll melt your heart and any dietary resolve equally  this bittersweet romantic farce teeters and then tips into precious  a forgivable sin once you know this sweet movie s sad history  while shelly s film trades in an especially outrageous form of girl movie self consciousness  she s completely sincere when it comes to making her heroine the irresistible repository of our sympathies  this is an ensemble piece in which everyone is allowed to shine  russell is the magic ingredient that holds all this together  waitress deserves an essay  not just a review  there are perfect moments that stand out  and the reasons for their perfection are interesting  
748,simpsons_movie,definitely worth your money  
749,u2_3d,u2 just look like four conceited billionaires who are further up themselves than ever  bono should refrain from ramming his preachy political meanderings down our throats and let the music do the talking  even if some of that music becomes a little stultifying  the concert itself is spectacularly produced  with jumbotrons providing backdrop and long  curving runways that allow bono and other band members to move far out into the crowd  having these enormous  almost disembodied figures endlessly cascading through space is more distracting than illuminating  it s an incredible performance captured in a medium that attains a unique aesthetic of immediacy and humanity from the powerful rock quartet  
750,10009066-la_graine_et_le_mulet,a ponderous tragedy about put upon manhood  a verite snoop into cultures that are sexually mingled but publicly uneasy  a pill to be swallowed in the name of serious filmgoing  maybe all of these  the cast is solid  with standout performances by first timer habib boufares as slimane  
751,sweeney_todd_the_demon_barber_of_fleet_street_2007,it keeps getting bloodier by the scene  yet remains curiously engaging  without any warmth and humor at all  how are you meant to care  i m not saying you always have to care about someone in a movie   not at all   but here the story is so ludicrous that  unless you can  why bother  this is a remarkable piece of work for people who like their genres all mashed together in a meat grinder  as unsettling as it is riveting  even sondheim aficionados will see the story with fresh eyes  unless those eyes are covered  sweeney todd ranks among this year s most intense  haunting  and startling films  the fact that it also features great songs by stephen sondheim is just gravy on the meat pie  scissorhands was bright with eye popping pastels that took on a sordid sheen  sweeney has no such subtext  it s black  black  and gray  except when the screen floods blood red a grimy concoction from hell s own kitchen  laced with black humour and seasoned with hauntingly beautiful music  tuck in  a thoughtful  sincere and moving film  buttressed by a fine  central performance by an actor at the top of his form  whether horror fans are ready for high notes or musical buffs will appreciate dario argento levels of gore is an open question  but this is a rich  demented experience  this sweeney todd is all subtext and no substance  it starts off large and swaggering but doesn t know where to turn next  burton seems fixated on serving up an event  to the extent that he neglects to dig into the story  mesmerizing and highly entertaining

753,italian,despite channeling dickensian melodrama  first time director andrei kravchuk skilfully avoids wallowing in sentimentality  this 2005 story about a russian boy whose mother has given him up may be derivative  but it s still engrossing  largely because of its appealing juvenile lead  kolya spiridonov  at times  the difficulties that vanya encounters strain credulity  the italian doesn t bother to infuse its characters with complex motivations  they re either bad or good  the ending isn t exactly happily ever after  but it leaves you with a deep down respect and affection for this determined little tyke who perseveres against all odds  wise  resilient children aren t especially new to the movies  but when they re presented this sensitively  they re always worth revisiting  milking sympathy for parentless children is no stretch in the italian  more impressive is its affecting look at their reeling mother country  kravchuk  a veteran of russian tv  means to show his countrymen how they have failed kids like vanya  but also to convince them that vanya and his friends can still be saved  without becoming italians  while i wanted more early on  and while i m not at all sure i liked the voiceover coda   vanya s journey is so stirring and heartwarming it is very easy to overlook the minor missteps holding the picture back a bit from true magnificence  first time feature director andrei kravchuk infuses the entire atmosphere with a formal neorealist haze that is squalid and striking  
754,wind_that_shakes_the_barley,raises hard questions about ireland s uncanny ability to kneecap itself   loach  has made an often handsome  always sobering movie that does what the best movies do  leave us a whole lot less sure about what we ought to think  this dramatization of ireland s early struggles for independence falls short of a certain originality or flair  
755,unreasonable_man,this fascinating documentary examines the issues raised by nader s runs for the presidency   that shone a powerful light into our grubby political shadows  and also played a part   that twice put george w  bush into the white house  it can t help but remind us that the man nader prevented from becoming president has since been more instrumental in the war on environmental pollution than any other public figure  irony abounds  you may walk away from it still wondering why nader persisted in running for president in 2004 after being repeatedly begged not to  but  whether or not you admire the decision  the film forces you to admire the determination with which nader made it  this documentary starts out as a fascinating profile of consumer advocate ralph nader  but it ends up getting derailed by a political discussion marked by an abundance of whining  an unreasonable man pays true homage to a man of vehemently held ideas by forcing us to engage our brains at the same high level of consciousness  every time a belt gets buckled or an airbag inflates  the movie argues  somebody somewhere has nader to thank for it  though filled with talking heads and clocking in at two full hours  it s thoroughly involving  and its two part structure explicitly balances nader s phenomenal career as an anticorporate gadfly in the 60s and 70s with his role in the election of  bush   eschewing narration or direct questioning  the directors instead employ a vast archive of consistently engaging clips from nader s many congressional battles  nader haters may not be mollified  but an unreasonable man  like its subject itself  is a one stop civics lesson no one should miss  what an unreasonable man does best is rehabilitate nader s career prior to the election and remind us of an unparalleled public interest legacy stretching over four decades  a spellbinding cautionary tale about the dangers of purity and the ugly necessity of compromise and pragmatism  
756,ohorten,bent hamer has proved himself an apt pupil of such deadpan comic filmmakers as jim jarmusch and aki kaurismaki  depending on your patience for oddball mood pieces  you will either sleep through o  horten or be oddly captivated  either way  it ll be like dreaming  jack nicholson s dyspeptic retiree in about schmidt would no doubt identify with o horten s entertaining pain  
757,the_orphanage,let the anticipation of bayona s next move begin  a frightening movie that earns its scares the hard way  generating unbearable tension through artful technique instead of computer  at a time when american horror seems transfixed by graphic sadism  the acclaimed spanish chiller el orfanato harks back to an older tradition of psychological scares and things that go bump in the night  a good old fashioned horror in the best possible way  this is a beautifully told  terrifying ghost story that lingers with you long after the shivers have stopped  an extraordinary performance by bel n rueda is the beating heart and tortured soul of the orphanage  superb  even the cliche spooky kids are handled with aplomb  haunting and heartbreaking  the orphanage delivers a double whammy of chills both real and supernatural  this is the worst sort of horror film  one that cloaks its shameless pulls at the heartstrings in overemphatic sound design  hyped up visuals  and a tear streaked lead performance by belen rueda  the movie is so good at using its horror elements to explore deeper  less fantastical emotions  for all its bump in the night suspense  the orphanage is ultimately as much about motherhood and grief as it is about apparitions and shadowy corridors  a well made  spanish ghost story that will creep you out and draw you in  
758,god_grew_tired_of_us,can there really be no footage of their uncertainty  anger at unfriendly americans  even an embrace of bad habits  while it is emotionally and spiritually satisfying  its optimistic point of view avoids harder truths it might have explored  
759,lookout,frank has cooked up an interesting moral dilemma for a character ill equipped to deal with one  chris has made one big mistake  is he up for another  the film describes emotional and moral rehabilitation in the face of extreme danger  forgettable fun  plot holes and a mixed tone lessen the impact but gordon levitt holds it together with a strong lead performance  there s nothing here you haven t seen before  and even the pleasant hum of a well tuned engine begins to drone a little  a straight ahead drama  perfectly accessible though psychologically intricate  coupled shrewdly to a crime thriller  the movie is sometimes deliberately paced  then intensifies at unlikely moments  artfully blending pulse stopping  nerve jangling suspense with sharp dialogue and nuanced portrayals  gordon levitt finds something heartbreaking behind chris  blankness  you can almost watch  on his face  memory quietly draining away  quietly flavored with sad resignation  it s a performance that s remarkable for what isn t there  an original  intriguing thriller with two excellent performances by a pair of the best young actors working today  writer director scott  frank isn t afraid to kill off one sympathetic character  or have another simply disappear  and unlike other writers turned directors  he s not afraid of his own camera  either  
760,the_edge_of_heaven,propelled by the beautiful camerawork and scenery that moves back and forth between pastoral idyll and urban chaos as it takes the viewer on a journey that ends with a final image as quiet and beautiful as any in recent cinema  in a single two hour film  akin strikes the notes of emotional distress  geographical dissonance  generational discord  and nearly divine convergence that kieslowski orchestrated over nearly six hours  the film moves its own intricately syncopated rhythms  an exquisitely mysterious feature by the german born turkish filmmaker fatih akin  
761,youngheart,that not all of them do sadly lends a much needed emotional depth to a doc that  odd beautiful moments aside  can feel like a solid reality tv hour stretched out to 108 minutes  bring hankies  what makes young heart such an ingratiating experience goes far deeper than the novelty of seeing old people singing hard rock tunes  
762,2_days_in_paris,   an impressive  funny urban comedy of manners from a suitably distinctive voice that i hope we ll hear again soon  the last time i laughed so hard at a movie  it was nigel tufnel telling us his amplifier went to 11  2 days in paris proves delpy s got an authentic ear for humor in two languages  and she turns the dewy eyed notion of paris as a city for lovers firmly and affectionately on its t te  delpy does the old  woody  allen thing a lot better than most  and does for paris what allen did for manhattan  making it look newly romantic even to those who have lived there all their lives  the news that the 38 year old gamine has not only directed two days in paris but produced  written  edited  written the music for and starred in it might be slightly terrifying to all but delpy obsessives  but it s great  delpy has a knack for finding just the right details  filming in her own hometown  she fills the movie with funny cross cultural observances  it s possible to watch 2 days in paris and have absolutely no idea who s calling the shots  this is excellent news because it means that we gain a director without losing an actress  
763,control,ian s trapped between insurrection and guilt  and so is corbijn s film which mires itself in the artist s bourgeoisie dramas without figuring out how they influenced his music  sam riley is fascinating as curtis  a hypersensitive young man hobbled by his incurable disease  and samantha morton is poignant as his put upon wife  though curtis is hopelessly dysfunctional  photographer turned filmmaker anton corbijn makes us achingly aware of the singer s talent  the haunting poetry of his songs and how  living in the gloomy culture he did  his passing was virtually inevitable  riley delivers a tremendous performance  not so much a mimic as a wholesale recreation of another human being  control suffers a bit from a touch of dry art house movie self consciousness  but that s easily offset by the deeper soulfulness through which the film patiently reveals curtis  full  almost oracular gifts and the cost of his ordinary burdens  
764,1159135-hoax,looks good without ever really catching fire  
765,must_read_after_my_death,a searing and intimate account of an unconventional woman struggling not to lose her identity or her sanity in the rigid 1950s suburban world of stay at home moms  well behaved children and sparkling clean houses  like other family doc gothics  the heart of the suburbs is gasp  black as bile  unlike them  however  this has a strong female voice that gives us chills from beyond the grave a bloodcurdling 75 minute diary assembled from an astonishing stash of audiotapes and dictaphone recordings  cries and whispers out of one documentary filmmaker s family history  dews helps allis hold out a gendered posthumous snapshot of an era whose smug surface  barely masking oceans of suffering  makes revolutionary road look like a tea party  raises unsettling questions about the erosion of the private sphere  morgan dews has fashioned his documentary with a historian s skill and an artist s eye  the relentless negativity in must read after my death can become overwhelming at times  but it s undeniably mesmerizing  i watched this film horrified and fascinated  there is such raw pain here  i can recommend this film with the proviso that you don t have to accept it at face value  for myself  i found its frankness entrancing  
766,shotgun_stories,set in rural arkansas  jeff nichols  relaxed  distinctive debut revels in the milieu of its redneck characters  but injects their rural half blood feud with an almost mythic quality  a precisely modulated yet cumulatively forceful story of a rural family feud turned deadly  few films are so observant about how we relate with one another  few are as sympathetic  jeff nichols modern western is laconic and lazily captivating  its silence slowly building to rage  well plotted  with a strong lead performance by michael shannon  and a fair amount of authentic regional flavor  it isn t really meant to be a treatise on southern life  at heart  it s a country fried genre film  minus the peppery white gravy  yes  it s a mite pretentious and on the slow side  but debuting director jeff nichols has an eye for small town america and a sensibility that he shares with fellow north carolina school of the arts alumnus david gordon greene  like his fellow mason dixon minimalist david gordon green  the film s producer    director  nichols favors mood and ellipses over momentum and explanations  which gives this contemporary hatfields versus mccoys narrative a beguiling  drifting atmosphere  
767,time_crimes,the director operates his metaphysical contraption with enough wit to jolt away your skepticism  spanish filmmaker nacho vigalondo s low budget brain drainer timecrimes is only half as clever as it thinks and even less entertaining  trippy viewing awaits  as long as you re not a stickler for logic  proof positive that a naked hottie and whiz bang pacing can disguise gaping narrative cracks  timecrimes makes sci fi lemonade out of low budget lemons  
768,grindhouse,grindhouse contains thrills to keep viewers in their seats  plus moments to think about on the ride home  which will probably seem unusually fraught with peril  
769,joe_strummer_the_future_is_unwritten,the big unanswerable question is  do we wish strummer would have listened to david lee roth s advice that  you don t have to take life so seriously  honey   temple has plenty of cinematic tricks and willing interview subjects  julian temple has done cinematic justice to the punk humanist born john graham mellor  suffused with clear eyed affection for its subject and times  this is not your little brother s punk documentary  
770,red_road,unfortunately  its superb performances and assured camerawork are overwhelmed by dubious psychology and a clich d climax  like the peeping tom paranoia of similar recent films disturbia and civic duty  this finely crafted debut feature by scottish writer director andrea arnold packs a wallop  though it s paced as a thriller  the film ultimately emerges as a haunting exploration of how grief can weigh on us  and the depths to which it can drive us  a must for movie lovers who want to see how so much drama  mystery and emotion can be created from so little  it should be noted that red road contains one extremely graphic sex scene  but like much else that transpires in red road  what is seen is not always what it looks like on the surface  for a voyeuristic medium  this tale of a voyeur does a poor job of prying into its own protagonist s life   director arnold  drops the voyeurism theme almost entirely  a bait and switch that doesn t cripple red road so much as snip off its richest and eeriest thread  though not flawless  this is a compelling study  in dogme style  of a wounded young woman who spends her working life spying on others  it s impossible to predict when the next two thirds of this advance party concept triptych are going to look like  but with characters like these    and actors like these    it s easy to be optimistic about the stories they still have to tell  a sexy and cunningly disorienting thriller that provokes the viewer into a state of anxious participation from first to last frame  despite the thick scottish accents  filmmaker andrea arnold kept me intrigued  but beyond a certain point the movie s ambiguity fades into indifference  dickie is intense in her screen debut  which requires her to be in nearly every scene  the supporting cast is strong  and robbie ryan s handheld camera provides gritty ambiance for this taut thriller  if you think about it too closely  andrea arnold s jarring feature debut doesn t quite hold up  but chances are you ll be so focused on her lead  kate dickie  that you won t even notice  the queasy mixture of sympathy and curiosity that red road evokes is evidence of a talented  risk taking filmmaker discovering her power  
771,atonement,joe wright directs atonement with an eye to framing each performance with spectacularly vivid images  including a genuinely breathtaking tracking shot on the bloody  wreckage strewn beach at dunkirk  as good a film as one could imagine having been made from a great work of contemporary fiction  
772,bridge_to_terabithia,a family film that recognizes that there are some interesting  intelligent fifth graders out there who aren t obsessed with fart jokes or potty humor  
773,show_business,theater fans will give it a standing ovation  others may be moved only to polite applause  for those who believe there s no business like show business  this documentary will be a singular sensation  bright lights  big drama  a delectable trip down broadway  it is filled with neurotic people in greasepaint  some charming  most amusing  and by the time you ve spent an hour and a half with them  you re more than invested in their lives and cares  the film s slick and entertaining  an obvious must see for musical hounds  it holds water for laypeople  though  because the insights into a communal creative process are so sharp  sheds much needed light on a fascinating show business institution  dori berinstein s cameras catch gallant theater people doing what they ve done since sophocles was a pup  rehearsing  revising  worrying  learning  stretching  struggling to bump things up from good to wonderful and constantly  fervently hoping  dori berinstein s fine documentary chronicles the production of four high profile musicals during the 2003  04 new york theater season  much of this strikingly human  rapidly paced and laudably well rounded film is fascinating  made with care and affection  short on insight  you ll have to look elsewhere than this love letter to the great white way to explain why wicked and avenue q became huge hits  and why caroline  or change joined taboo as a costly flop  what stands out  not surprisingly  is the work and passion that goes into the shows  but seeing all this from the inside creates an extraordinary level of empathy for those involved  
774,starting_out_in_the_evening,wagner s film is an elegy of sorts for that once mighty beast known as the new york writer  a creature that now finds itself increasingly marginalized in a world in which readers are getting scarcer and shelf space for serious fiction is dwindling daily  we re pretty much left waiting in this drifting melodrama about living the artistic life in new york and the ambition it takes to do that  starting out is a movie for savoring  not one whose flavor explodes on your palate  but its minor key attractions are substantial  it honors values that seem obsolete in our trashy popular culture  obsessed with the sex lives of vacuumheads  
775,breach,breach is slow  but never ponderous  and not at all like your average spy thriller  it has less obvious thrills and more depth  a sombre game of cat and mouse  what it lacks in genuine tension it amply compensates in the understated performances of the two leads  intriguing and intelligent  breach may be too understated for its own good  an interestingly told tale  melancholy  thoughtful  and very un american  despite a couple of tense set pieces  the suspense needed to ignite this film is disappointingly lacking  cold and cerebral  with simmering suspense rather than outright excitement  this is a feel the quality of the acting movie  it can t answer all sorts of questions  but does take a scary mug shot of a subtle monster  cooper is superb  hard as granite  dense as an imploding black hole  ray s impression of the real hanssen remains frighteningly opaque  ray s careful emphasis on authenticity over thrills and psychology over action is impeded by this narrative s narrow window  there s so much we can t know about what hanssen did and why  breach is competently made but  aside from cooper s performance  there s nothing here worth getting excited about  a well paced  intelligent thriller that s easily the most pleasant surprise of the year so far  subtle  complex  bleakly funny at times  but always utterly enveloping  one of the great studies in profoundly abnormal psychology  
776,syndromes_and_a_century,its rhymes and echoes make its folds endlessly fascinating  you have to abandon any preconceived notions about movies and allow your mind to be seduced by the mystifying  occasionally humorous world of a one of a kind filmmaker  you might even find yourself becoming a fan  
777,into_the_wild,sean penn s majestic travelogue about a young drop out on an idealistic quest in the great american outback is the best film the writer director has ever made  although mccandless s story is undoubtedly fascinating  and penn s film contains moments of magic  it is a lesser piece of work because it prefers to accept its subject at face value rather than ask a few crucial questions  the photography is of the sort you d find in any half decent nature documentary  with cloying emphasis placed firmly  and sometimes clumsily  on the idea that our neglectful  selfish and not to mention rampantly capitalist ways are destroying the planet  
778,into_great_silence,this 2005 feature is demanding to say the least  but its pulse slowing rhythms leave a real sense of peace   some  viewers are likely to consider this nearly three hour  nearly soundless documentary as a chance to catch up on their sleep  as we vicariously participate in their daily rituals  we find ourselves at the ground level of spiritual worship  it s hard to recall a similar documentary that brings viewers so palpably close to that sacred experience  the silence captured in this documentary may be the most eloquent you ll ever hear  though it likely will not persuade people to join the ranks  experiencing life behind the walls has an undeniable effect  we ve been allowed a glimpse of eternity  and who would not be changed by that  their silence is full to the brim with incidental sound that functions as both score and narration in this hyper empathic film  for two hours and 42 minutes  into great silence offers painterly images of an existence that is  almost literally  too reverent for words  it sounds more like an endurance test than entertainment  yet this one of a kind experience proves surprisingly immersive  a rapturous  absorbing experience    it has no voice over  no back story or history  no archival footage and no talking heads    but only if you can surrender yourself to it  
779,boy_a,it makes us feel sympathy for the devil  we re introduced to more string pulling symbolism than a movie this inherently sad ever needs  it s too much  
780,paris_je_taime,taken as a whole  paris je t aime slips down easily enough and offers a few whimsical smiles  but you may find yourself craving more substantial nourishment before the end  in all their variations  with many of them graced by the presence of big name actors  these 18 movies coalesce into an incandescent portrait of a city rife with possibilities for romance  split evenly between the inspired segments and those that fall flat  this ambitious omnibus is still worth watching  with 18 pieces in all  there should be something here to tantalize everyone s tastes  or at least prompt you to contact your travel agent to book a vacation  most features composed of sketches by different filmmakers are wildly uneven  this one is consistently mediocre  albeit pleasant and watchable  
781,10008234-alexandra,at least one critic has called this sokurov s most political film  but on its deepest level it considers not a particular war but the complex feelings between mothers and the young men they send out into the world to kill or be killed  sokurov is able to say things about the terrible conflict without obvious polemic but to the maximum possible effect  that s largely why he is one of the most audacious and original directors in the world today  a bone weariness pervades every inch of the film  even the light is bleached dry of vitality  apart from a thoroughly irritating background track of schmaltzy classical music  this is sokurov at his shortest and most digestible  it s also quietly challenging  in its own way  not least in its portrait of old age  its trials  new freedoms and the privilege of changing one s mind before it becomes too late  this is war as stalemate  with aleksandr burov s bleached images creating an alien landscape in which colour is as rare as compassion  rarely has combat seemed so savage or futile  remarkable  how little sokurov tells us  while telling us so much  the film is built on a massive incongruity  watching this octogenarian drag her little bent up wheeled luggage cart  amid rolling tanks and military transport trucks  you re looking at two eternal verities u2014war  and civilians caught up in its wake u20 alexandra is a pleasure to watch  but it s also one of those lovely  unclassifiable movies that flourishes better with repeated or prolonged exposures  in the hands of visionary filmmaker alexander sokurov  this simple material makes for a haunting drama about war  generational relationships and the human condition  aleksandr sokurov s anti war drama alexandra opens with a curious image and spends 90 minutes squeezing it for all it s worth  
782,live_free_or_die_hard,though it s mostly entertaining  if overlong   there is a sense that the whole thing has become somewhat rote  len wiseman handles many of the set pieces with flair and tension  it s not remotely plausible  but with willis  mcclane leaping onto the tailfins of passing jet fighters and bringing down helicopters by launching police cars at them  there s enough stuff blowing up that action fans won t mind much  the bad guys  omnipotence at nearly every turn dilutes the film s suspense  an enjoyable pop projection of post 9 11 anxiety  that said  it also makes you nostalgic for the days when irresponsible action movies didn t have to deal with it  movie characters like mcclane are the paul bunyans and john henrys and pecos bills of our age  the stuff of tall tales spun with the technology of an age whose campfires are found in multiplexes with stadium seating  the rookie mistakes are legion  willis should not be the victim of facile stereotyping  he brings more heart and humor to apocalyptic pulp fiction than any other actor i can think of offhand  this fourth episode of the die hard series  with its plot that seems to have come straight out of marvel comics and its preposterous if dynamic action sequences  has only a battered 52 year old bruce willis as john mcclane to commend it as a drama  at least i hope it s the last  willis does ok for a middle aged guy  but as another famous die hard once said  a man s got to know his limitations  you know where you are with bruce willis  unlike schwarzenegger  he won t be moving into namby pamby politics any time soon  he differs from stallone these days in managing not to resemble an aborted experiment at madame tussaud s willis was entitled to one more kick ass action outing  but please  let this be the last  anything more would be dying soft  it s less yippe kay yay  more yippee kay maybe  
783,roman_de_gare,an engaging  enjoyable slice of suspense from the french  red herrings abound and audience frustration sets in  it s a pity because the film looks good and the gilbert becaud songs on the soundtrack are easy on the ear  lelouch is now 71 years old  and i bet he s never had as much fun with a film  roman de gare threads plots and characters and twists together like a demented weaver  it s intellectually cagey  potentially romantic  and  above all  an entertaining puzzle box of duplicitous people doing mysterious things  men and women  forty years after his breakout success as a filmmaker  claude lelouch makes something of a comeback with his playful and sexy whodunit  roman de gare  lelouch and his longtime writing partner  pierre uytterhoeven  slyly exploit and subvert audience expectations  i think i understand the alternative realities of the plot  and i concede the loose ends are tied up  sort of  but i didn t care  don t go to the theater expecting too much and you can t help but leave with a smile on your face  lelouch s deft touch with various cinematic styles  however surface  enables him to interweave pastoral elegy  quirky social comedy and thriller with fluid ease  the movie is more entertaining than it is logical  its narrative leaps are sometimes ahead of our ability to believe them  but as the compellingly enigmatic pierre  pinon keeps us rapt  an ingenuous knot of plot  expertly tangled  in which nothing is quite what it seems  this goofy tale of self emancipation  a love story made by a mature man wise to the possibilities of the improbable  is also a thriller with an unexpectedly dark edge  it s the smartest and best suspense movie you re likely to see for a while  a glossy  enjoyable thriller that isn t quite as tricky or hitchcockian as it wants to be  roman de gare gets by on high style and nice central performances by rubber faced dominique pinon and audrey dana  
784,charlie_wilsons_war,hanks may at first seem like an unlikely choice to play a seasoned texas playboy bachelor  but he s so ingratiating that he almost pulls it off  hanks  performance as wilson is tone perfect  capturing both the public servant seriousness and playboy rakishness of his character  and he does it without breaking a sweat   a nyone who s seen  say  michael winterbottom s welcome to sarajevo or even one of those late night  save the children  tv spots has seen much more gut punching stuff  mike nichols  fast talking political comedy says every word but osama bin laden  it all adds up to something very unsatisfying  and less than honest  the surreal comedy is that every tense twist of this secret war is horribly true  the performances are likeable and entertaining  while nichols pumps the whole proceedings with a satisfyingly fluid  dramatic energy  extremely enjoyable  although it s a little tonally unsure  whenever hanks and hoffman are on screen  any misgivings are forgiven  maybe it wasn t his fault those chickens came home to roost in the form of the taliban  but you have to wonder  would nichols have given oliver north such an easy ride  something doesn t smell right with charlie wilson s war  i m not particularly concerned with the specific facts it has left out of its telling  but what has been left in feels compromised and dodgy  it is so much fun watching these actors enjoy bouncing off each other  it s almost too easy to forget the importance of the story being told  if charlie doesn t feel quite real  hanks at least makes him good company

787,i_dont_want_to_sleep_alone,i don t want to sleep alone which ends with a vision of fragile and drifting bliss as oneiric as anything in the swamp moss pherics of andrei tarkovsky is nothing short of a dream music interlaces the action  which proceeds mostly without words  expression or  regrettably  interest  working from a sombre palette and with little to no dialogue  tsai crafts a dazed fantasy about companionship and its power to revivify  spare an evening  if you feel adventurous  this mostly wordless saga is striking but slight  an enigmatic fable of longing and loneliness in present day kuala lumpur  the hormones here don t rage so much as unfurl over two exquisite hours  tsai s drama is something like a mixture of robert bresson and r w  fassbinder  as god s bedraggled souls struggle with the desires of the damned  and nobody wants to go into that good night alone  for tsai s fans  sleep offers many pleasures  including a heightened attention to nocturnal beauty and a gorgeous  uncharacteristic surrealism  the film ends so beautifully that it s easy to forgive the dead passages that preceded it and hope it carries over into his next movie  a serious return to creative form and a renewal of focus  there s a sense that every perfectly timed slow take and studied composition serves a purpose  and not a single melon gets shtupped  despite his films  frequently static compositions  tsai s cinema flows ever forward with ambiguous  multivalent purpose  it s an achingly poignant meditation on passion and loneliness in oxygen choked kuala lumpur  
788,american_gangster,telling a true story doesn t excuse a filmmaker from making his movie stand out from the many others that have traversed similar ground  best of all  there are top flight performances from both denzel washington and russell crowe who create interesting  rounded characters out of potential clich s  ridley scott s american gangster offers both belated history lesson and demented hero worship  and seems to be intended as a kind of gift to black america  one hopes that black america will have nothing to do with it  here s a startlingly original true life story told in an oddly unoriginal way  and that attempt at instant classic status in the title doesn t quite convince  it s got no more dark grandeur than american idol  length does not add substance to the drama  even where reality adds weight to the argument  an entertaining romp through familiar cop and crim cat and mousery  bolstered by strong star turns from washington and crowe  still  it has neither the intelligence nor the grip to jump from the merely good to the truly great  almost makes up for gi jane  a guaranteed shot of pure heart pumping entertainment  washington s steely grip on his impersonation of frank lucas holds the film together  ridley scott s listless big statement is a wheezy  hot air inflated dud  
789,10008699-terrors_advocate,the story schroeder unfolds is also his own that of a generation that had its humanistic sympathies manipulated by unscrupulous people with agendas of horror  the movie functions crackingly well as a non fiction international thriller  schroeder s film  which combines interviews with many of the key figures in vergs  career with grainy historical footage  lets its subject speak for itself but leaves little doubt of where the filmmaker stands  talk about a hard sell  that  director  schroeder doesn t offer simple explanations gives his tale honesty and fascination  sure to inspire debate in france and germany and of obvious interest to anyone who follows the roots of modern international terrorism  doc probes gray areas in the colorful life of its controversial  limelight courting subject  
790,rocket_science,lovely performances all round create small town competitiveness  frustrations and aspirations  needlessly cruel comedy  what begins as a straightforward tale of adversity overcome  however  takes some unexpected detours en route to its defiantly non formulaic ending  rocket science flies beyond the standard teen preoccupations  moving into territory that combines humor and eccentricity with fragile hope and ambition  making for a film that embraces every awkward angle of adolescence  
791,talk_to_me,a stronger screenplay and more sensitive direction would have made this movie into something far more genuinely uplifting than it is  there s terrific chemistry between the leads  but an episodic structure set over 20 years is too sprawling to really allow for a connection  he mood shifts awkwardly from broad comedy to melodrama and social commentary  
792,gypsy_caravan_when_the_road_bends,not quite fully satisfying as either cinematic ethnography or as a concert film  
793,the_witnesses_2007,excitingly convoluted  the witnesses doesn t pay off with a great operatic pinnacle  but it s better that way  better to show people we care about facing facts they care desperately about  without the consolation of plot mechanics  an ambling narrative  but an atmospheric one that feels authentic despite its unlikely character pairings  bristling with emotional intensity  this is far superior to earlier aids related dramas such as the platitudinous philadelphia  
794,xxy,if it isn t exactly a happy ending  it s at least an acknowledgment that her character will develop long after the credits roll  sometimes that s the best we can hope for  the movie s images are frequently startling  its performances sharply observed and quirky  and its take on its subject matter undeniably provocative  the most original coming of age drama you ll see this year  see it not only because it works as an exquisitely tendered emotional experience  but also because it is the first cinematic treatment in fictional form of a taboo breaking ticklish subject  it takes a controlling hand to chisel something more contoured than monotony out of this dense angst  and director luca puenzo doesn t have it  
795,harry_potter_and_the_order_of_the_phoenix,performances are more mature  the soundtrack  by nicholas hooper  less grandiose  and yates executes some thrilling set pieces  brought me straight back to one of the most enduring of childhood feelings  boredom  we do get terrific work from the all star british cast  and the special effects are as seamless as ever  the end may be in sight by now  but we re still not sure if it s a light at the end of this particular tunnel we see or the cold headlamp of some hell bound train  bearing down on magic and muggle alike  a series that was in danger of becoming an adventure playground for digital trickery    not another miraculous monster or flying thingummybob   we protest   exhibits  for once  a strong plot with a satirical edge  if yates and goldenberg haven t given the story shape  they have given it pace   something missing from the bloated and  to my disenchanted eyes  dreary book  even if the moments don t always connect  few of them are dull  truth be told  it s the lad s many onscreen allies that prove the film franchise s richest draws   thank you  alan rickman  for your wonderfully embittered turn as severus snape   yates  especially given the sinister subject matter on hand  does a rather workmanlike job of traffic managing the action  but some of the magic effects are indeed magical  this is the bleakest potter installment to date  and under david yates s choppy direction  maggie smith  emma thompson  brendan gleeson  and david thewlis have little more than walk ons  now that harry has ditched childhood  it seems high time the franchise also dispatches with its immature and draggy literal mindedness  the whole hogwarts faculty is so beautifully cast  it reinforces the american impression that in britain great actors must be piled up on the side of the road in heaps  
796,wardance,because no one dares to call a film about suffering children boring  fine and nix slack on analysis and investigation and concentrate on gorgeous saturated cinematography the joyous song and vibrant dance of the schoolchildren uplift all who see them  they are war orphans  casualties of uganda s civil strife  healing physical and psychic wounds by performing ancient tribal rites in a national competition  this is documentary making at its best  not pretending to be journalism  but still playing a crucial role in telling stories that otherwise wouldn t make the front page  there isn t enough uplift  gratuitous or otherwise  in the world to make you forget the graphic testimony of children compelled by rebel forces either to watch atrocities or commit them  i d be lying if i didn t say it overcame my naturally complacent instincts  
797,mighty_heart,knowing how this harrowing story played out in real life doesn t diminish its power in the slightest  although it is impossible to erase the spectre of brangelina from your mind altogether while watching jolie inhabit the role of mariane pearl  you can manage it for surprisingly long stretches at a time  jolie  dominating nearly every scene  is rather remarkable in this star vehicle  effectively conveying a convincing combination of unwavering dedication and the dire desperation of a woman who insists on remaining at the center of the search for her man  aside from casting jolie  the bravest decision was to shoot largely in karachi  the risk pays dividends with highly evocative location work that allows you almost to the smell that crowded city and feel the chaos  for all its kinetic energy and sweep  michael winterbottom s hyperactive new film is really nothing more than a very  very classy tv movie  michael winterbottom presents a documentary style chronicle of events that is completely unsentimental and at the same time full of compassion  
798,mio_fratello_e_figlio_unico,a hit in its native country  it just didn t translate for me  and sitting there taking it in i was absolutely dumbstruck who in their right mind would actually want to sit through the darn thing  
799,manufactured_landscapes,proves even more revealing than the photographs it celebrates  an astonishing visual indictment of man s inhumanity to mother earth  as seen through the documentary prism of jennifer baichwal  what the film does well is to make us part of the problem  after all we demand the lowest prices in everything we buy and that probably means it was made in china  my first question  what kind of nefarious events had to occur so that i could purchase the computer with which i write this review  feels constrained and rather dutiful  no matter how passionate these people are about what they re observing  again and again  baichwal tapers passages of her film toward resolution in the form of a finished picture by burtynsky  telescoping her vision and his  unfortunately this film  for all its mesmerizing merits  isn t that alarm  the clock still ticking to doomsday while we all continue to sit by and twiddle our thumbs in misbegotten stupor  without browbeating  hectoring  lecturing or sermonizing  manufactured landscapes makes an inelegant point elegantly  the point  humanity is altering the landscape drastically and by implication irrevocably  manufactured landscapes is a visual poem  an irony in that it moves slowly while capturing beauty about industrial life which is rarely either  doesn t go very far beneath the surface  or ask many provocative questions  
800,the_dark_knight,this may seem like faint praise  but about the highest compliment i can give christopher nolan s the dark knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which i didn t even realize it was a superhero movie among the great strengths of the dark knight is the way it combines hardboiled naturalism with the kind of stunts and setpieces you expect in summer blockbusters  to talk of heath ledger s performance is difficult  merely because  as gigantic as it is  it is only one important feature of an intricately wrought canvas  an exceptionally smart  brooding picture with some terrific performances  the dark knight is a film that s fantastic on the action front  seeds its acrobatics in its own reality  and always feels relevant even when its ideas are drowned out by clatter  the symbiosis of good and evil is the film s philosophical core  and images of duality and cloaked identity are strewn through it like shards from a fun house mirror  you will exit the cinema with an enhanced respect for nolan s intelligence  for wally pfister s pin sharp cinematography  and  sadly  for an acting talent tragically curtailed  shouldn t nolan  marvellous as his directing here is  be creating original films rather than rebooting and retooling franchise fare  watching the first dizzying  vertiginous overhead shot of the glittering skyscrapers and minuscule streets  i literally forgot to breathe for a second or two  and found myself teetering forward on my seat    i m betraying my childhood to concede this  but nolan has finally topped tim burton s two twisted spectaculars  christopher nolan s latest exploration of the batman mythology steeps its muddled plot in so much murk that the joker s maniacal nihilism comes to seem like a recurrent grace note  
801,the_wrestler,the wrestler runs on what are admittedly pretty traditional lines for a sports film  yet runs on them with exhilarating speed and attack  i was waiting for a cop out ending  but it never arrived  not only has he hauled rourke from his self pitying slump  but  working from a screenplay written by robert d siegel  he has created an often brutal  always compelling portrait of a decent man trying to peel himself off skid row  the platitude intensive script by robert siegel would have been laughed off the screen without rourke s dogged grandeur  a beautifully etched  touching essay about a damaged  desperate brute hoping for one taste of dignity and real fatherhood before his life goes down for the count for the final time  as far as i m concerned  you can keep your sean penns and your brad pitts and your frank langellas  if there s any justice in the world  this year s best actor academy award will be going home with rourke  
802,man_on_wire,the tension builds incrementally  reaching almost unbearable heights at its dizzying climax  it all makes for an absorbing  mischievously amusing yarn  whose climax unfolds with unexpected emotional force  sufferers from vertigo be warned  man on wire contains some of the most amazing scenes of hire wire brilliance ever filmed  
803,let_the_right_one_in,my favorite swedish import  sinister but gorgeous and compelling  lovelier than most bloodsucker flicks  but it doesn t quite transcend its well chewed genre  calling to mind the work of anne rice and stephen king  atmospheric adaptation of swedish author john ajvide lindqvist s bestseller is well directed by his countryman tomas alfredson  it s everything twilight wanted to be but wasn t  beautiful to gaze at  achingly romantic  emotionally involving  unexpectedly terrifying  let the right one in manages its own sense of doubleness with uncommon daring  you don t see many love stories that bring together pubescence and vampirism in such an elegant clinch  as vampire movies go this touches the cloak hem of masterpiece  he and his team have conjured up  from a remarkable piece of writing  one of the best  most imaginative and resonant vampire stories i ve seen  a modern genre classic  reinterpreting a familiar story with emotional delicacy and visual force  
804,wall_e,the most consistent production unit in hollywood just hit another home run  
805,iron_man,there are a few scenes in iron man that make you realize why we rely on giant studios and big budgets come the summer months  
806,frostnixon,many viewers will just go along with frost nixon because of how great sheen and langella absolutely are  nixon is infinitely more complex than george w  bush  which is probably why this one slice of his life is more intriguing than  w   which covers decades  stirring stuff that works thrillingly as drama  and should make sheen a star  even if it compromises on historical insight  the outcome isn t half as conflicted as you might imagine  though it s hard to argue that howard brings anything new to morgan s play  it sounds like an awful night out in the cinema  but you will be amazed  in frost nixon ron howard turns this duel between michael sheen s glossy playboy and frank langella s shifty ex president into a gripping tango of egos  i found myself disconcerted and underwhelmed by a hugely anticipated movie  it never quite escapes its stage origins  and under a glitzy surface of period stylings doesn t seem to have much to say  director ron howard  less an artist of film like van sant  more a resourceful pro  lays his cloak down for the miraculous script and makes sure everyone can walk with dry feet towards the awards ceremonies  one feels nagged all the way by its self proclaimed momentousness  a joy to watch its multi award nominated actors spar  frost nixon is no crowd pleaser or jaw dropper  but it is two actors at their peak talking beautiful words  in front of a camera  all this makes for great entertainment on the big screen  though the real legacy of the nixon interviews is more vexing than morgan would have us understand  
807,milk,penn may be the main attraction  but this is very much an ensemble piece  emile hirsch  as cheeky street kid turned activist cleve jones  diego luna as milk s annoyingly needy  unstable second lover and james franco s scott  add to the communal spirit  sean penn gives a meticulously detailed performance as the cagey and charismatic pol  but credit should also go to dustin lance black  whose script squarely locates milk at the center of his community  his city  and his cause  the film itself can be taken as an act of testimony  mingling archival footage with re enactments and immediacy with nostalgia  milk thoroughly deserves all of the press ink that will doubtless be spilt over it  wear your  vote penn  oscar pin with pride  van sant s skill as a film maker is showcased here to inspiring effect  rarely has a lesson in political history felt so involving and alive  what s more  it s a genuinely important film that could not be better timed  this is a warm  beautifully detailed  if slightly long winded biopic from good will hunting director gus van sant  
808,slumdog_millionaire,boyle set out to make this particular film rather than a gritty social panorama along the lines of brazilian favela drama city of god  but keeping us cheerful takes the edge off the tougher insights into india  dickens would undoubtedly have approved  after all  his stories invariably had happy endings  
809,1216014-still_walking,even in subtitled form  this is a dialogue masterclass  sly comments and pointed asides take precedence over upfront speechifying  while revelations are subtly layered in without narrative strategies becoming unduly obvious  subtle and multi layered film making with compelling performances  koreeda s almost sage like understanding of what makes modern families tick places him and this wonderful film in the league of japan s grand master  ozu  and you can t ask for higher praise than that  a beautifully measured melodrama that owes much to yasujiro ozu s japanese classic tokyo story  
810,waltz_with_bashir,it is powerful because this work of art also provides such a cautionary tale about the psychic burdens young soldiers carry deep inside them decades after they ve laid down their weapons  
811,the_class,these kids aren t always all right  but they are consistently riveting  
812,1195103-happy_go_lucky,the intentions of this oddity are muddled  but the small portraits of ordinary people choosing their path through the daily range of depression and delight are fully alive  mr  leigh has executed a richly exuberant entertainment for our troubled times  and deserves still another of my honorary oscars for his astoundingly skillful effort  
813,35_shots_of_rum,these people feel one hundred percent real  as well written and completely defined as those living in the apartment next door to you right now  don t miss this one  characters tend not to say things that are explicit  we piece together bits of information from here and there  and we re left to draw some conclusions on our own  perhaps as a result of channeling ozu  denis s incipient humanism comes through more directly than in her existentially forbidding the intruder or even her acclaimed  baroque herman melville remix beau travail  
814,burma-vj,burma vj would be even more intense without its early announcement that some scenes have been restaged  putting the viewer in a regrettably uncertain relationship to what follows  
815,chop_shop,all these low level criminal enterprises and idle dreams aren t happening in mexico city or kandahar  they re just outside queens  bahrani celebrates those who never give up  no matter how badly their dreams are shattered  bahrani deftly walks a tightrope toward insight  never falling into safety nets of judgment or unearned sentiment  
816,bigger_stronger_faster_asterisk,there s been a glut of pointless first  person documentaries lately  but newcomer christopher bell has a legitimate personal take in his film about americans who use anabolic steroids  
817,trouble_the_water,essential  startling and distressing insight into what it was like to be in the eye of the katrina storm if you were a poor  black resident of the ninth ward of new orleans on monday august 29 2005  this gutsy doc  directed by the producers of bowling for columbine  has a raw  grass roots perspective that makes the social devastation sink in afresh  roberts needs more practice at holding the camera steady and framing shots  it doesn t matter  we feel her footage at the base of our spines  trouble the water  along with spike lee s extraordinary four hour epic  when the levees broke  remains one of the most eloquent records we have of a tragedy that brought out some of the most impressively alive men and women in new o filmmakers tia lessin and carl deal have fashioned a deeply moving story of resilience and redemption  
818,les-plages-dagnes,although you will get more out of this self portrait if you re a film lover  it can be enjoyed simply for its touching  eloquent reflections on life in general  it s impossible not to open your heart to this film  a loose leaf diary in which the pages are shuffled by instinct  wit and surreal art  the warm  elfin filmmaker makes a fine companion through this vivid story of a life well lived  reminding us at the end of how we create our own safe havens within our families  
819,the_pool,it tells you a lot about south india  its essentially rural culture and the stifling poverty of its underclass  hopefully smith will make more movies in this laid back  poetic style  a fascinating narrative set in modern day indian and full of insights into a class riven country  patekar s ability to convey stoic forbearance with so little apparent effort  is one of the marvellous rewards of this intricately textured and compelling film  a miraculous  american made hindi film that is every bit as tranquil as the blue green reservoir that serves as its abiding metaphor  reality and fiction fuse like watercolors in this quietly compelling narrative feature  the pool takes viewers on a journey to goa that is startling not only in the lush physical beauty it reveals but also in the subtle  finely wrought emotions it stirs  many directors claim to value local color  but few have gone as far  or achieved such impressive results  as has chris smith in the pool  it doesn t sound like much  but in the hands of director chris smith  this setup makes for a good small scale observational picture about young people finding that the world is a larger place than they imagined  for his keenly observant narrative feature debut  documentary filmmaker chris smith and writer randy russell have deftly transposed russell s short story the pool from iowa to the indian state of goa  in the small city of panjim  a lovely  warm  unforced film that gives you time to get to know its characters and isn t propelled by any artificial narrative conventions  or for that matter by any dickensian social outrage  
820,10009355-sugar,this masterfully pitched exercise in sombre revelation may frustrate sports fans looking for an easy hit  
821,not_quite_hollywood,this is as insightful a glimpse into a country s cinema as you re likely to see at this running time  not quite hollywood is jammed with well preserved clips of the aussie movies that started pushing the limits after censorship was essentially dropped in 1971  what s cool and always kicky is seeing a country s irreverent movie trash being treated with such  well  reverence  although not quite hollywood was clearly put together with fanatical love  the suspicion remains  as often with genre cinema  that these trash rich movies are a lot more fun to hear about  and to watch in snatches  than to sit through  there are clips from more than 80 movies crammed into 100 consistently hilarious and jaw dropping minutes  from soft  and hard core porn to cheesy   gory horror movies to biker and car chase movies that make the fast and the furious look positively tame  it s a kicky  slightly exhausting look at a bygone era of low rent moviemaking  whose colorful trove of film clips should delight fans of cinematic esoterica  nostalgic schlock and high octane drive in fare  if mad max  a rare stateside success  is the only down under and dirty flick you remember  you missed out on a vital drive in culture  one that mark hartley s not quite hollywood does a suitably supercharged job of chronicling  cheerfully celebrates the energy and creativity of this subculture  and wants to rescue it from the toffee nosed pundits who looked down on the genre  there is a remarkable story to be told of outlaws carving out their own slice of the industry with scant regard for decorum  personal safety or narrative coherence  the end product  while shallow and sometimes disconcertingly furtive  offers an enlightening  pleasurable peek into one of cinema s more enticing dark corners  hartley s own film is much livelier than most of those he is out to celebrate    partly because of its abundance of genuinely hair raising behind the scenes footage  
822,gomorrah,we don t get to know the characters  exactly  but we experience something more interesting  we are brought into disconcerting  almost documentary proximity with the lives they lead and the worlds they inhabit  gomorra has its own nerve  as well as the filmmaking intelligence to strip the cliches from its densely packed  authentically inhabited narrative  the new moviegoing year just got one hell of a jolt  gomorrah manages to be artful without being arty  
823,bolt,the perfect holiday movie follow on for those kids and kidults still high on the comic buzz of madagascar 2  in the pre thanksgiving lull  parents can take their young uns to bolt  drop their 10 to 14 year olds off at twilight  and the whole family will have survived the weekend  
824,hellboy_2_the_golden_army,clearly  such material appeals primarily to teenage fanboys  but del toro s dark humour broadens its scope  the plot is paper thin  something about an ancient battle between humans and mythical creatures and a goblin built clockwork  but guillermo del toro s talent has always been to create worlds and bring creatures to life  the parade of creatures del toro and his team have come up with as this scenario unfolds  starting with a tour of the legendary troll market that one ups the mos eisley cantina scene in star wars  will make you want to tip your hat in wonder  let s hope universal stays the course and gives us that opportunity  people as creative as del toro and his gang need all the support we can give them  easily the most enjoyable of recent comic book movies  in the end i found myself pulling for the bad guy    because at least he was interesting  the film is designed more as an ear shattering sensory assault than a conventional narrative  all the same  this isn t a patch on the phantsamagoric splendour of pan s labyrinth  over egging every set piece and outstaying its welcome by at least half an hour  the film shows a certain wit and a refined eclecticism  a director who in a few seconds combines mozart s clarinet concerto  a quotation from tennyson s in memoriam and two monsters singing beautiful freak deserves watching  
825,caramel,caramel is sweet  but it s never sickly  and it never shies away from how these women have to work round what society has planned for them  it s one of the best films about women you re likely to see this year  labaki elicits expressive performances from a cast of amateurs  aided by khalad mouzanar s entrancing score and yves sehnaoui s lush cinematography  there s a pleasant  easygoing charm to caramel  largely stemming from labaki s rare determination to depict beirut as something other than a war torn  slowly recovering battleground  its chief focus is the bonding between women who rely on each for support  and who really appreciate a place where they can let down their hair  filmgoers expecting my big fat lebanese waxing are in for a bigger treat  nadine labaki  who wrote and directed the film  possesses an astute instinct for restraint that makes caramel smarter ans more poignantthan the average chick flick  a delectable slice of life whose flavors are rarely available on these western shores  one of those small films that give a glimpse into a culture that s both foreign and familiar  it s filled with real life touches and small insights and wonderfully human characters  and the whole thing feels as real as crossing the street  don t expect an elegant  fully realized production  do expect  though  to be touched and surprised by a string of intimate  urgent vignettes  a sweeter and more believable version of steel magnolias  middle eastern style  just another good looking  gently humorous  pleasantly romanticized little comedy  which ends with everyone a little wiser than they began  
826,1197307-ballast,sags in the final third  but the impeccable craftsmanship keeps matters afloat  although the film never fulfils the promise of its elliptical  mysterious opening   the drama occasionally lacks momentum as it proceeds towards some sort of resolution   there s no denying its intelligence  compassion and assurance  debut writer director lance hammer has rendered  ballast  with something that can only be called radiant austerity  this ostensibly simple film evokes whole lives in 96 minutes  and does so with sparse dialogue  this austere  rigorous film has a sense of place  a feeling for reality so compelling it makes us feel like we re living it  not just watching on a screen  ballast is an impressive first feature  the movie is a beacon of independent filmmaking  not simply because hammer opted more or less to self distribute it  but because it s evident that we re a million miles away from hollywood  
827,1202867-dear_zachary,just take our advice and bring tissues  you re going to need them  a slick account of ancient crevices in the human psyche rendered in cutting edge cinematic style  a four handkerchief documentary if there ever was one  
828,hunger_2008,the stylistic palette of mcqueen s picture  and its grasp of cinematic vocabulary  elevate the film to a purely visceral realm  so that it seems to bypass your eyes and ears and go straight for your nerve endings  midway through the movie there s an epic 24 minute scene   in the claustrophobic cell block the protesters have already internalized their cause so deeply that the world of words seems distant and inconsequential  it s a strength of this carefully composed  almost obsessively controlled picture that it has no interest in the conventional biographical focus on a subject  the film is stunning  bare  minimalist  stark and based in a hardened reality that s as hypnotic as it is horrific  this is as gut wrenching an exercise into documentary like historical fiction as any i m ever likely to see  in the end  it is not bobby sands but michael fassbender we are looking at  and this realization takes us out of the movie just as surely as  for me  de niro s fattening up did in raging bull  a visually ravishing tour of hell and a meditation on freedom that at best is wordlessly profound and at worst interestingly obscure  in the end  even though i recognized the need to be reminded of guant namo and of crimes carried out there  i was awed but not moved by hunger  a mesmerizing 96 minutes of cinema  one of the truly extraordinary filmmaking debuts of recent years  regardless of politics  one must grant mcqueen s substantial gifts  which bring to mind paul greengrass in another northern ireland film  bloody sunday  
829,transsiberian,a first class white knuckle trip  the eventual resolution is too neat  but striking cinematography and brilliant performances sustain transsiberian and leave you wondering why it never made it to uk cinemas  anderson has made an engrossing thriller well supported by its impressive atmosphere and his deft handling of suspense  though not one for literal smoke and mirrors  master of horror brad anderson  with his panache for arousing fear from harried reality and rotted atmosphere  is still a shaman  a terrific combination of action  mystery and adventure brad anderson  session 9  has always been strong with chilly atmospherics especially this time  employing the eerie vistas along the legendary line that stretches from beijing to moscow through thousands of miles of wilderness to great  exotic effect  all in all  the film is an excellent  if modest  alternative for moviegoers who have been blockbustered into submission this summer  unfortunately  there s never a moment where you can t see anderson and his co writer  will conroy  yanking on the strings  director brad anderson throws in a red herring or two as he comments on eurotrash and the greed fueled lawlessness of the former soviet union  but he ultimately makes an even stronger statement about the dark side of female empowerment  transsiberian is more than a rote thriller  it s also a sharp character study    actually  several studies in which the information about each character is slowly revealed and every scrap of knowledge further informs our understanding of the plot  as alfred hitchcock demonstrated three times  trains make a nifty setting for a thriller  transsiberian is a model of audience manipulation  a slow fuse thriller that builds its suspense gradually  in increments  until it has becomes close to unbearable  then it pushes things just a little further  until you re squirming in your seat  a morally complex if plot wobbly thriller set on the trans siberian express as it rockets  well  creaks and groans  through snowy forests and forgotten towns  transsiberian starts in neutral  taking the time to introduce its characters  and then goes from second into high like greased lightning  i was a little surprised to notice how thoroughly it wound me up  this is a good one  in the end  while i wanted more i can t exactly say i felt cheated  and considering all the crap i ve endured so far this year that s one trait i can t help but applaud  
830,10008820-visitor,this gifted writer director knows how to illuminate those moments in which people realize they have become essential to each other    that each person s life has been gently changed by the other s presence  
831,kung_fu_panda,the animation work is dazzling  it s lovingly detailed without being overdone  particularly the opening sequence  which is hand drawn and looks like prints struck from ancient woodblocks   manages to entertain and dazzle  and parents won t beat themselves up for sitting through it  although what it teaches could fit on a fortune cookie  hands down the most visually striking of dreamworks animation s releases  this lively cgi comedy is tailor made for jack black  it all whizzes along at an invigorating pace and there s plenty to please a young child but if you re looking for the kind of insights that made ratatouille such a feast  you ll have to wait for pixar s next  this is the finest dreamworks animation effort since the first shrek more original plotting could have bolstered this visually magnificent production  the action tends to blur into a whirlwind of slapstick chaos  neither as original as ratatouille nor as funny as shrek  kung fu panda gets across important and inevitable plot information in ways that are novel and unexpected  things simply don t happen the way they usually happen in animated stories  the animation is dazzling  so lovingly detailed you can make out individual hairs on the titular beastie  and full of bright chinese images  
832,moscow_belgium,there aren t many surprises u2014the characters end up more or less where we expect them to u2014but it s useless and not at all fun to deny the simple pleasures of this film  emotions run deep but are never overdone  
833,frozen_river,melissa leo must take at least as much credit for the film s successes as her director  she isn t merely tough as old boots   she makes old boots look like ballet shoes  frozen river let me forget i was watching a movie  something that didn t happen often in 2008  there are moments of poetry on display  
834,ive_loved_you_so_long,in a few moments the british actress  playing a haunted woman named juliette  will begin speaking french  but in these moments her face reveals more than any dialogue  in a profession that routinely casts aside leading ladies when they hit 40  it s a shame a great one had to take her act to france to remind us that actors  like wines  only improve with age  utterly absorbing  an uneven new french film that plays like a companion piece to the recent british drama boy a  what s more  she does it with brutally direct simplicity  belying the usual overly emotional histrionics and quirky tricks actors tend to employ when taking on a character with this much melodramatic baggage  philippe claudel is a successful french novelist  so it s odd that his filmmaking debut suffers more from narrative than cinematic flaws  
835,1190970-ghost_town,i like gervais but now realise there is only so much i can take at the one sitting  writer director david koepp is almost too careful a craftsman for his own good  but gervais and leoni share a talent for throwing the audience off balance    sorrow and darkness aren t far below the surface of this lovely comedy  which makes our laughter more agreeable  and more frequent  this just kind of fell flat  ricky gervais has carried off a proper  big hollywood film  he may not be a natural  but he s done it without any hesitation or cultural cringe or apologetic foregrounding of his britishness  he s cracked it  and yet the film  while it gets so many of the smaller details right  including an ending that puts the corny closures of so many hollywood romances to shame  never quite rings true  it is so nearly a ghost themed remake of groundhog day that you can t help but think how much more interesting it would have been reworked by harold ramis with bill murray in the lead role  funny but familiar  koepp s comedy feels like a multiplex reincarnation    we ve seen this film before and back then we must have stepped on someone s toes it s enlivened by the performance of ricky gervais as bertram pincus  a latter day scrooge for whom the living are no less annoying than the dead  
836,10009419-mommas_man,jacobs s low fi third feature forges unique stylistic territory for the american independent film  this simple but assured indie drama about the safety of childhood and the necessity of leaving it is particularly affecting because writer director azazel jacobs draws so heavily on his own life  the film is decidedly low key  as such movies go  it s enjoyable  though you might find yourself wishing mikey would just pull himself together  this enjoyable lo fi indie pictures an extreme example of a failure to sever the apron strings  the main character in momma s man shuffles through life like he s been poleaxed  and you may feel the same after you watch this slow motion indie exercise about a grown up who returns home and can t leave  
837,wendy_and_lucy,in happy sum  reichardt is one more of the current american directors  most of them still young  who are endowing our film world with pleasure and hope  i expect there will be more stories like wendy and lucy s in the coming months and years  the wonder will be if they articulate their compassion and distress with such unforced eloquence  the climax is a heartbreaker  and in its haunting finale the movie recalls no less than mervyn leroy s depression era classic i am a fugitive from a chain gang  evanescent and intangible  it dissolves into the air  leaving something tragic and mysterious behind  reichardt  working as she did in old joy from a short story by jonathan raymond  is unwilling  as she was in old joy  to either romanticize or condescend to her characters  self willed marginality  kelly reichardt s devastating little film has attracted a lot of admiration since its debut at cannes last year  partly because of its timeliness  wendy and lucy is quiet  deliberate filmmaking  see it knowing you will witness an idiosyncratic take on storytelling by a fundamentally independent filmmaker  the classic indie sundance idiom of reticent performance  affectless dialogue  stonewashed colour photography and plain  sans serif lettering on the credits  slow  ponderous  meticulously rendered realism that will appeal to specific audiences of slow  ponderous  meticulously rendered realism  with a heart  williams  with pageboy haircut and a martyrishly sad face  is quite lovely as this lost soul  while writer director kelly reichardt catches something poignant in the windblown spaces of the american north west  
838,tropic_thunder,the bulk of this movie  alas  comes down to weak sketches held together by ridiculous action  vast explosions and more or less everything else it should be parodying  tropic thunder gives us exactly what we expect of it   lashings of easy fun  spare no expense action  actors delightedly pushing the boat out in all out parody and a dig at the absurdity of hollywood that the big boys back in la will find quite comforting you may think i m being a spoilsport but i m doing you a favour by lowering your expectations  get the beers in first and tom cruise jive dancing to t pain s lo in a hairy fat suit may well be the funniest thing you ve seen that evening  but its better moments of self referential snark  such as an ace cameo from tom cruise as an obnoxious studio exec  have the feel of a superior end of term revue  stiller never stops bombarding the audience with outrageous ideas  like a monkey throwing dung at a wall  
839,rachel_getting_married,hathaway s performance has been deservedly nominated for an oscar  whether or not she wins  here s hoping the associated kudos saves her from ever having to do another bride wars  one of hollywood s forgotten masters and one of its brightest new actresses team for what could well be an oscar wild card  those who surrender to demme s disarming  almost participatory technique will find themselves overwhelmed  exhilarated and inspired by the eternal possibilities of cinema  if anyone can claw the oscar statuette from kate winslet s eager hands  it s likely to be anne hathaway for her brittle  emotionally ragged performance as a recovering drug addict  i found these heart on sleeve sequences really charming and open  and the people in them looked like real human beings and not actors   overemotional  perhaps  but overemotional in the way real people are at real weddings  you ll be very glad you were invited because this is a friendly  unpretentious bash  with not a meringue dress in sight  the speeches are funny  the music is ace and the mood falls just the right side of sentimental mushiness  the film  like the shindig  ends up dissolving in a schmaltzy brew of make do and mend  complete with a sari clad wedding accompanied by multi ethnic music  whose pc touchy feeliness one hopes is a joke but fears is not  director jonathan demme  who says he wanted to make  the most beautiful home movie ever made   didn t rehearse scenes before filming  he and hathaway  as much as lumet  deserve praise for creating a pariah at once close to home and unique  rosemary dewitt is fantastic  rachel getting married is a magical wallow in excess  a too happy  too sad  too indulgent plunge into an over planned wedding  no doubt it was fun assembling so many close associates  but like kym  demme doesn t know when enough is enough for those who aren t part of the family circle  
840,grocers_son,it s a small  well rounded movie that you d be hard pressed to find fault with  achieving its modest goals with subtle aplomb while whipping up humour and empathy from antoine s rapport with his doddery clientele  it s sublime work  the whole picture having a firmly enthralling lived in consistency that s cant help but feel utterly genuine  the real joy of the film comes from the many charmed moments of naturalism in which director co writer eric guirado captures the interaction between people of different worlds with luminous authenticity  
841,in_bruges,its european setting places additional gravity on mcdonagh s irish catholic notions of reckoning the knowledge that we have to pay for our sins  no matter how great or small  
842,the_unforeseen,by turns rapturously beautiful and unspeakably sad while considering the consequences of unchecked urban sprawl  even if the director eventually hard pedals her pantheist imagery into clich   this inconvenient truth is discreet  intimate and regularly surprising  no one who sees this intriguing documentary will want to argue with reporter greider when he forcefully insists   we need a more mature regard for the future   we do indeed  though fittingly directed by laura dunn  one can t help but feel the presence of producer terrence malick  the movie wavers between sundance friendly issue film and spiritual reverie  add the unforeseen to the catalog of artfully produced nonfiction films that show how humans are screwing up the planet  the movie s glacial pace and willingness to let its mind and eye wander that produces its spiritual and intellectual heft not to mention its atypical visual splendor  a beautiful  soulful work about real estate development and sprawl  focused on austin s beloved barton springs  and if you think that s impossible you haven t seen it  the kind of transformative viewing experience that has made the current period a golden age for nonfiction film  
843,10009929-a_christmas_tale,perfect off season timing for a wickedly off kilter movie about a french family christmas in extremis  yet as the film progresses these multifarious layers of dramatic ennui and vitriol becomes absolutely intoxicating  and before i knew it my eyes were glued to the screen and i almost couldn t wait to see what was going to happen next  
844,mongol,when we think of the fearsome genghis khan  we don t picture him as ever having been a little boy  but he must have been  and that is where this grand throwback to the sweeping historical epics of yesteryear takes up the great khan s story  genghis khan s lost decade fuels a handsome fantasy  temudgin is so single minded that asano has trouble suggesting much about his inner life  
845,shine_a_light,amazingly  jagger turns 65 in july  and although his face is carved with lines  his stage act hasn t changed much since the band played madison square garden nearly 40 years ago  the music s insistent richness builds and builds  its sound becoming so deep and persuasive that qualms about age fade and the rhythms carry us away  this is how great rock and roll was meant to be filmed  by great filmmakers  
846,forgetting_sarah_marshall,russell brand is  for once  well cast in the role of vague  vain singer aldous  who s also the object of obsession for a waiter and aspiring musician in the hawaiian resort  judd apatow s comedies are always watchable and sometimes hilarious  but with the latest to emerge under his aegis  i have to admit it is getting harder to defend them against the charge of misogyny  it s got an engaging cast and enough laughs to compensate for some shortcomings  with pratfalls  yucks  a crying jag  and what is starting to seem like the requisite flash of nudity  jason segel becomes this year s adorably hapless movie schlub   d eftly mixes raunchy  r rated comedy with an intelligent  humane look at the foibles of the heart that s almost like something out of an eric rohmer movie  jason segel has what nicolas cage and gene wilder and a precious handful of other witty actors have  the ability to make egregious humiliation and painful neediness a source of limitless mirth  halfway through i realized that i d lost most of my standards  maybe under my seat  and was enjoying the erratic evolution of the nonsense  the cringingly wacky scenarios  offbeat characters and comic dialogue serve up a crowd pleasing  laugh filled experience  this is a fairly low keyed comedy  but a grown up dropping in on it can appreciate its lack of frenzy  its fundamental good nature  as easily as its core audience will  it isn t exactly a gem  but as zircons go  it ll do  forgetting sarah marshall should please audiences eager for silly summer comedy  particularly  the hawaiian sunshine should delight those currently enduring a gray seattle spring   like its predecessors  forgetting sarah marshall is a smart comedy that trades on social embarrassment and shows love from the standpoint of male insecurity  forgetting sarah marshall follows the apatow formula faithfully enough  all that s missing is charisma    the je ne sais quois that makes us fall in love in the first place  forgetting sarah marshall goes out with a whimper when you so want a bang  but until then  this so called romantic disaster comedy is a raucous ride through one man s pain  this film is so funny it may be beside the point to complain that  as in many apatow productions  the writing and direction are still in something of a state of arrested development  we know actors are trained to let it all hang out  but jason segel takes naked vulnerability to new levels in nicholas stoller s likable debut  forgetting sarah marshall  
847,24_city,through interviews with retired workers and faux interviews with scripted characters  jia brings long repressed history to life on an intimate scale  24 city belies its documentary origins with overtly poetic film language  the film is an elegiac visual symphony of carefully framed compositions  trompe l oeil camera movements  posed portraits  internal rhymes and mysterious vignettes  a blend of documentary and drama which is by turns movingly authentic and deliberately artificial  24 city includes evocative footage of factory 420 s dismantling  but emphasizes people over place  strongest moments are when the pristine hd lensing by hong kong s yu lik wai  a jia regular  and wang yu  and warm string music by yoshihiro hanno  take over in montages showing the gradual dismantling of the factory  zhangke never hints much about politics     his is more the story of ordinary people caught up in history and still determined to live their lives as well as they can  it s both relevant and resonant  a deeply serious and sombre film  trying to find a way of telling the stories of people affected by the gigantic political and economic changes sweeping that country whose concerns must in the end affect us all  21st century china  chinese arthouse fixture jia zhang ke looks at the closure of a state owned factory in chengdu  combining real interviews with awkwardly am dram mock ones  the film takes on an operatic feel  moving between euphoria for the new and lament for the lost  the director has an exquisite eye that keeps getting stronger and subtler  he trusts that beauty is vagueness s alluring upside  the actors in 24 city  an experimental fiction nonfiction hybrid  bring their own existential realities to their short  touching performances  this subversively old fashioned hymn to industrial production is filled with offbeat  vaguely absurd details  
848,wolke_neun,the film may attract older moviegoers curious to see their generation represented onscreen doing what comes naturally for once  it s doubtful that the general audience will be so inclined  this is a disarmingly tender human drama examining whether the elderly should prioritise lust or loyalty  shared memories or unforeseen adventures  
849,i_o_u_s_a,this solid doc reminds us how unsustainable the current american economy is  unexpectedly entertaining  given that it s about dodgy accounting on an epic scale  the film predicts an economic cold shower that is about to douse america s prospects  thanks to its ever expanding national debt  patrick creadon s film is a lucid history lesson in the failures of successive republican presidents to put a stopper in the country s leaking fiscal hole  not something your average cinemagoer wants to see but important information nonetheless  let s hope obama is watching  a movie that should be seen by everyone  this movie makes a devastating case for the consequence of our current  rob peter to pay paul  budgetary shell game  though the filmmaking is playful at times  the film is essentially 90 percent message  10 percent movie  then again  sometimes a message is important enough to make other considerations seem irrelevant  packed with facts  figures and the testimony of policy experts  the film is no wallow in wonkiness  but a surprisingly sprightly tough love lesson in fiscal responsibility  documentarian patrick creadon does a nice job of making the daunting math and economic theories associated with our national debt accessible  
850,gonzo-the-life-and-work-of-dr-hunter-s-thompson,neatly balancing full hearted celebration with evenhanded examination  
851,vicky_cristina_barcelona,allen seems uninterested in pushing his material beyond impersonally generic  or even in thinking things through  for all its meditations on romantic disappointments  this is a slight  sunny film  anyone in need of some superior escapism should see it straightaway  leave it to woody allen to muck up a threesome involving scarlett johansson and penelope cruz  hard to tell if woody s schoolboyish crush on spain  gaud   miro  flamenco   rivals his one on johansson but both are equally embarrassing  the erotic roundelays are so witty   marivaux with sex   that i am now afraid to see a future allen film  it will either be bad  returning us to the natural order of things  or good like this  demanding a rethink of the universe  it s determinedly silly  and possibly wishful thinking  in essence  after what we ve seen from allen from match point onwards  its sheer entertainment value is a minor miracle  a sparklingly funny  meltingly sexy romcom  the humour is more situational  less assertive  less reliant on wisecracks and obvious punchlines  
852,indiana_jones_and_the_kingdom_of_the_crystal_skull,expecting brando esque menace or dreyfus ian uplift from the indiana jones tetralogy is like going to the candy counter at the mall multiplex and asking for some goat cheese and a nice cabernet  nobody can orchestrate this robust silliness better than steven spielberg  who brings effortless visual panache to the proceedings  even when he can t entirely hide its mercenary nature  
853,meduzot,there are sharply observed moments of social intercourse and a nice current of realistic honesty  but when i ask myself what it is that these women in the movie want  i come up with bubkes  provides a diverting portrait of modern day israel  as the filmmakers eschew history  politics and religion to focus instead on more intimate and universal issues of fate  loss and the longing to connect  these stories have as their justification that fact that they are intrinsically interesting  i think that s enough  the film doesn t so much move as glide  each scene seeming to tumble in one after the other like a slowly crashing wave coming into contact with the shore  it would be easier to recommend it if only  like its characters  it didn t drift quite so easily  aimlessly knocked about by the tide  there s enough material here for a miniseries  but the directors keep the proceedings to 78 brisk minutes without making the viewer feel cheated  jellyfish is the kind of film that will ring true for some viewers  while striking others as too slight and precious  the celebrated israeli author etgar keret and his wife  screenwriter shira geffen  directed this luminous foray into magic realism  tel aviv style  
854,baader_meinhof_complex,two problems i had with the film were that the subtitles were too small making them difficult to read and that they did not remain on the screen long enough to adequately read  nevertheless  it is an amazing movie and well worth your time  it d be nice to see an american filmmaker commit a similar reckoning with the watts riots  the weather underground  or the black power movement  not simply resort to cant and kitsch but to really interpret those moments  there are some literally killer performances here  most notably johanna wokalek as gudrun  there s an element of relatable humanity missing from the foundation of trying to tell a story that could have taken six hours in 144 minutes  but there s no denying the power of those 144 minutes  the baader meinhof complex is diluted by too many events and characters distributed over too much time  a rare epic that deserves every minute of its epic length  even though its purpose couldn t be more serious  its style could hardly be more pulp  which is probably fitting for a group that started out with high minded goals and ended up robbing banks and blowing people away  
855,lornas_silence,in casting the previously unknown dobroshi  the brothers approach greatness with their lean portrait of simple humanity tested by desire and driven desperate by circumstances  the story within lorna s silence is built on tiny increments of tantalizing details  meted out in penurious droplets and with chest tightening tension that suggests that what the brothers wanted to be when they grew up were boa constrictors  the dardennes are masters of their brand of realist cinema  over the years  the brothers  move from documentaries to narrative features has been handsomely rewarded  offers a damning critique of global capitalism as it works its way down to the street and poisons the most intimate human encounters  the dardennes  film offers a portrait of a fragile yet determined woman set on making a home for herself in the world  even as that world unravels before her eyes  what power is here  what affecting acting by dobroshi  renier and marinne  it leaves the audience with neither a sense of uplift nor devastation  but  rather  with something more akin to intellectual appreciation  that s as much as you should know before going into lorna s silence  which combines bressonian aesthetic rigor with hitchcockian suspense  lorna s silence is a gritty  deceptively low key  no fuss  no frills movie of consistent originality and surprise in which suspense arises straight up from the heroine s evolving character  like earlier dardenne films  lorna s silence is naturalistic  yet this one  beautifully shot in 35 mm film by alain marcoen  achieves a poetry of bereftness  
856,two_lovers,what s striking about this particular entry in the phoenix as isolated eccentric canon is its flavour of defeated animal loneliness  joaquin phoenix stars and delivers his most self scourging performance in james gray s taut and melancholy brighton beach romance  
857,flammen_and_citronen,madsen has acknowledged a strong debt to pierre melville s 1969 classic army of shadows  this one deserves a seat at the same table  madsen makes the most of his budget  and he keeps pulling his camera back for long  visually sumptuous overhead shots  it s hard to argue with such primal filmgoing pleasures  especially once the film introduces notions of how good people lose their morality during wartime  
858,burn_after_reading,made with the absolute assurance of filmmakers who know exactly what they re doing  
859,jcvd,think of it as sunset bloodsport with jean claude as norma desmond  seems like a spoof at first glance but this proves to be a compelling post modern thriller with gumption  a godardian coup de cin ma  there s something seductively clever about the way french director and co writer mabrouk el mechri has fractured chronology    la pulp fiction  to examine jcvd s plight from various perspectives  a clever art imitates life imitates art send up of celebrityhood and the state of the action hero genre  jcvd juggles humor with whomping martial arts moves and a kind of melancholy star turn from the melancholy  muscular star  
860,doubt,thanks to a nearly perfect cast  this provocative glimpse into the catholic priest child molestation scandal manages to be deeply disturbing on several levels  
861,in_search_of_a_midnight_kiss,an offbeat looking for love comedy with enough fresh notes to please even jaded viewers  smart dialogue  an impeccably crafted story  and eye catching la locations make this low budget feature by alex holdridge the most worthwhile date movie i ve seen in some time  turns into an internet age version of before sunrise  
862,spiderwick_chronicles,young moviegoers will like the way the film empowers their cinematic peers in this battle of good against evil  though smaller children will probably be scared out of their wits  the screen can t get enough of 16 year old freddie highmore  meticulously rendered cgi creatures spike this dark adventure  shot marvelously by caleb deschanel  instead of absorbing us into this magical landscape  this adaptation crams all five books together into a frenetic and frustrating 24 hour escapade 
863,beaufort,it makes an urgent case for the futility of most wars  which serve immediate political goals that afterward don t seem terribly important  
864,cloverfield,an efficiently gripping sci fi horror romp  cloverfield is visceral attack that it leaves the viewer reeling for details that flew by like so many bricks raining off broken buildings  
865,roman_polanski_wanted_and_desired,he claims here to have been influenced early on by snow white  i should have thought peter pan instead  whether you can swallow that or not  the mesmerizing narrative recounts a media circus of unrivaled malignance  a clever  contemplative kind of courtroom drama that utilizes the best of hollywood filmmaking style to tell a story so strange  it must be true  zenovich s zeal exceeds her grasp  
866,black_balloon,at its sharpest elissa down s feature directorial debut is guided by intense  rough edged emotional swings that feel authentically alive  even when the script settles for tidiness  there are wrenching scenes that are brutally stark  yet there remains a steady sense of calm that is touching and sensitive without ever turning sentimental  it s a film about a supposedly real world set up that never feels true  even though the people who made it clearly set out to treat their subject matter and the audience with respect  a writer director portrays life with an autistic brother to heartwarming effect  toni collette gives it the old little miss sunshine try in the black balloon as an edge of kooky  very pregnant mama presiding over a chaotic household  
867,1189844-the_bank_job,the first half is particularly strong  and while none of the pre heist team building or preparations are anything we haven t seen many times before these scenes are handled with such dynamic virtuosity they almost feel original and new  a tight  classic feeling film about losers banding together for one big score  then scrambling furiously as they realize they re in over their heads  it s fast  nifty  sharp and sweet  longtime screenwriters dick clement and ian la frenais have woven a masterful narrative full of odd twists and dark humor from which australian director roger donaldson and a prime cast mine plum characters and a tight plot to satisfying effect  there s nothing here as lively as in bruges or as arty as the recent london to brighton  but if we are in a mini renaissance of u k  thrillers  even the so so the bank job is a good reminder of what made them work to begin with  all in all  the film written by dick clement and ian lafrenais feels both absolutely of the 1970s and absolutely fresh  well paced  smartly told and unpretentious  this solid british heist thriller also has moments of invention and imagination 
868,horton-hears-a-who2008,frequently charming  beautifully drawn and far more faithful in spirit to the source material than those dreadful ron howard brian grazer productions  
869,disgrace,surprisingly successful adaptation  it s an enormously complicated story with great potential for reductive schmaltz  but this is avoided thanks to anna maria monticelli s sharp  sensitive screenplay and superb performances  it s hard to say what this solid but unadventurous film adds to coetzee s powerful source material  a worthwhile film which is concerned to do the right thing by a modern classic  it s a faithful adaptation  but one that s been indifferently shot by director steve jacobs  whose blunt technique tends to flatten the book s morose charge  still  the acting is often excellent  this disquieting drama serves as a platform for malkovich  whose eloquent performance draws you in with great compassion  as the last shot lingers  you long to find out what happens next  this is tragic inevitability at one mile per hour  extending into a slow  sunbaked danse macabre the drama s heartbreak and the guilt  anguish and wrath  the movie eventually begins to wilt under the sober  plodding direction of steve jacobs  but the thoughtful screenplay gives malkovich a complex  increasingly reflective character arc that he plays with great feeling  unfortunately  though malkovich remains a compelling and cerebral screen presence  he comes off as too innately detached and prickly to elicit much empathy  not that his character is asking for it  mind you   disgrace is an ugly movie  at times torturous to watch  it probably needs to be  i awaited the closing scenes of disgrace with a special urgency  because the story had gripped me deeply but left me with no idea how it would end  none    and i really cared  newcomer jessica haines is transparent and heartbreaking as the prof s unorthodox daughter  a victim of violence as the old ways crumble  steve jacobs  elegantly disturbing film follows the exploits   or  more accurately  the exploitations   of 52 year old professor david lurie  a dissolute aesthete whose erudition does little to mask grotesque character flaws  after a compelling opening act and some shocking late film developments  the film feels disengaged from the action at hand and the issues raised  i cannot tell a lie  i derive great satisfaction watching john malkovich act  
870,1216067-fifty_dead_men_walking,fifty dead men walking provides another example of what happens when mediocre moviemaking meets an interesting life  god forbid anything even slightly suspenseful or significant should happen without revved up  80s irish rock blasting over the soundtrack  
871,chicago_10,a documentary that somehow manages to capture the anarchic spirit of those topsy turvy times without devolving into anarchy itself  makes skillful use of documentary footage to relate what happened in the streets of chicago  culminating in what was routinely described at the time as  a police riot   a vibrant  unconventional documentary about the conspiracy trial of the so called inciters of the riots that occurred during the 1968 democratic national convention  if nothing else  it s a welcomed alternative to the more straightforward and serious film that spielberg is likely to deliver  given the filmmaker s privileged perspective of hindsight  to notconsider the real world repercussions of their theater  to not connect the dots between 1968 and 2008 is a squandered opportunity  it s a fresh and important new take on one of the most tumultuous periods in american history  as a peace loving liberal  cross examining morgen s rousing  worthy  but slanted film is as fun as kicking yourself in the shins  or watching clinton tear into obama  in the end  the truest thing that can be said for chicago 10 is that  though morgen did just about everything he could to make his movie unwatchable  the story was interesting enough to fight him to a draw  in eschewing the use of a narrator or talking heads  morgen leaves out too much crucial information  a provocative reflection of its rule breaking subjects  brett morgen s political documentary re examines the past while drawing unmissable parallels to the present  the director wants to bring recent history to life for people who weren t around to witness it  and in that he succeeds pretty admirably  worth seeing for the expert archival selections  but a decidedly mixed bag for anyone familiar  or unfamiliar  with the times  the movie dazzles us into self examination  an electrifying picture  
872,nothing_but_the_truth_2008,writer director lurie makes dramas that whole headedly engage ethical quandaries yet dodge easy judgments  
873,miss_pettigrew_lives_for_a_day,american lee pace  from tv s pushing daisies  manages not one but several creditable english accents  sometimes unfortunately all in the same sentence  but whose emotional depth shows up this ball of fluff as insubstantial  forgettable  despite its limitations  i found it impossible to dislike this frail little tale  mcdormand is frankly bland and unresponsive in a role she clearly couldn t care less about  adams s wide eyed ingenue routine is on autopilot  and the whole thing looks like a sub prime american tv movie  it s a squirming watch  at times quite tortuous because the film can never decide if it s a musical or a play with far too much music  director  bharat nalluri  keeps the comedy humming while unpacking pettigrew s sad back story  more than the sum of its facile narrative parts  as for adams  her breathily robust portrait is one part monroe  two parts holliday and one additional piece entirely of her own whimsically unique inspiration  at least miss pettigrew lives for a day has the good grace to go wrong quickly  you don t have to sit there squirming with doubt  
874,kit_kittredge_an_american_girl,it s hard to dislike a tween picture that opens with eleanor roosevelt  but if explaining mortgage meltdowns to their tots doesn t sent parents screaming  the performances will  a gently thoughtful  audience appropriate entertainment that assembles swell actors to play colorful characters who don t shy away from depicting serious hard times  this classy  heart on its sleeve movie is packed with laudable life lessons and depression era trivia  a thoroughly satisfying and engaging children s picture that never forgets those kids probably didn t get to the theater by themselves  three cheers for kit and for producer julia roberts for making this movie everything the devoted fans of the american girls series hope for  i think this film is very well directed  and you have some very funny performances  
875,role_models,rudd and scott aren t stretching any new muscles  but rudd s glum disaffection and scott s bozo bonhomie do gel with a satisfying stickiness  they handle the gaping innuendo with such delicacy we know that they know they re better than this  you can probably figure out how this is all going to end  but it still has more laughs than you might think  something bizarre starts to happen around the halfway mark  perhaps because no one knew how to develop the original premise  there are three things that every modern screen comedy needs  references to old kiss songs  guys dressed as knights whacking each other with foam swords  and a potty mouthed 10 year old  
876,i_served_the_king_of_england,the world it depicts is too dangerous and too lovely to classify  the pseudo sensuality is annoying and the supposed absurdism and satire are flimsy  tasty enough but inoffensive even when it should offend  provoke  startle   it s  surrounded by and infused with the potential for meaning but feels like a lark  a bit of nothing whistling past the graveyard of 20th century european history without a thing to do but indulge itself  most movies of this kind would lead towards redemption of sorts  menzel prefers quiet introspection to loud conversion  and that s both a strength and weakness of this movie  i served the king of england should be a brilliant picture  one last testament to the intertwined sensibilities of two brave artists  should be  but isn t  the minor protocols and major assaults of the characters are fused  paradoxically  by a truly lyrical talent  an extravagant  visually stunning feast of sensory delights  jiri menzel s winsome comedy  set in world war ii era prague  pirouettes along a beguiling but treacherous line between horror and whimsy  though the pervasive air of light hearted irony sometimes feels incongruous  the movie is never slow or dull  thanks to a playful series of slo mo fantasy sequences  the movie s main appeal is its special comic flavor    a zesty fusion of picaresque adventure  absurdist whimsy and chaplinesque grace  while the movie ebbs and flows to currents that are distinctly one of kind  the waves they ultimately make didn t move me to any sort of emotional release one way or the other  this episodic  picaresque film is one delightful surprise after another  a complete joy to watch  the film s whirl of history can be a bit vague at times  but that s a forgivable fault when your senses are so delightfully overwhelmed  with equal parts ribaldry and revelry  menzel tells the story of the manchild who rises from street vendor to waiter to hotelier  
877,standard_operating_procedure,probes deeper than any other iraq war documentary  
878,baghead,an extended navel gaze  a refreshingly brisk and modest salvo from the american independent film front  proving there s still interesting life in the scruffy  shot on video genre  the coda  even if it doesn t wholly work  should have some sobering lessons for would be filmmakers who see this  kids  try this at home  although the final act telegraphs the endgame a little too obviously  baghead is nevertheless a late summer treat  keep your eyes open  and there are lots of other  subtler things going on  a raw  wickedly clever comedy that also includes moments of genuine terror  baghead is an original  confident piece of filmmaking that isn t easily categorized or even summarized  the movie s concern with its characters  shifting alliances and petty vanities also evokes early john sayles and  at times  eric rohmer  
879,water_lilies,this is a brave film  and admirable for that  it s brave because it s sparse and stripped to the bone  because it s about teenage girls but it doesn t hide behind cell phones and make up and fashion and annoying parents who just don t understand  celine sciamma s quiet drama has moments of motionless yearning that contrast the intense emotions of its 15 year old protagonists  a hypnotic and wholly convincing look at teen culture from the inside  with all its courage  cruelty and unspoken codes of silence intact  although a little too open ended to be wholly satisfying  water lilies is still an excellent directorial debut  unfolding with a slow  steady certainty  this touching tale dives headfirst into the deep end of hormonal angst  water lilies sees female adolescence as an uncomfortable  embarrassing phase full of painful self consciousness and frustrated desire  
880,flow_for_love_of_water,problems are addressed in a narrative progression that gets more horrendous and builds into utter despair  except for the final few words of activism and optimism  salina s film might have been stronger had it not tried to cover so many water related issues  but there s no denying its power  when filmmaker irena salina does marshal the facts  flow is an eye opening  troubling 90 minutes that makes us think twice about an element we take for granted  offers up a call to arms against bottled water conglomerates that  in its structural sloppiness  feels like a high school student s tossed off research paper  irena salina s astonishingly wide ranging film is less depressing than galvanizing  an informed and heartfelt examination of the tug of war between public health and private interests  grim but ultimately hopeful  flow makes a convincing  impassioned case that concerned citizens need to fight for the right to clean water just as assiduously as yauch and his beastie compatriots once demanded the right to party  one of those charming little documentaries that make you question whether the human race is really worth preserving  
881,10008785-appaloosa,brush away the dust and you ll find a sense of nostalgia and romanticism about lost american values and altered social hierarchies  it was at times incredibly slow and even poorly edited  and i ve never understood the appeal of renee zelwegger  ed harris does it better than anybody  dialogue  much of it lifted straight from parker s novel  proves mostly engaging  there s a refreshing vein of understated humor running throughout the production  it s neither forced nor unnatural and it keeps things from becoming too somber  even when the bullets start flying  after appaloosa establishes its slightly modern characters in a traditional setting  it has nowhere to go but toward the completely expected  harris directs with a steady hand and sharp eye for the best in his fellow actors  mortensen should certainly do another western  soon  preferably he should do one with a real sense of danger to go along with all the neat  tidy  highfalutin  honor and decency  a suitable slow burn punctuated by sudden acts of violence  it fairly oozes off the screen like bloodied molasses  and then  heated  bubbles up and over  all smoke and fire and endless clouds of new mexico dust  appaloosa is a familiar story told well enough that it s worth seeing  but won t truly linger for any but the most diehard western fanatic  
882,yella,this disquieting parable about trust and risk wrong foots us at every turn  
883,curious_case_of_benjamin_button,for a melodrama concerned with emotional pain  this fairy tale favours formal trickery over human connection to a fault  the film unfolds like an epic poem  and like longfellow or yates the imagery catapulting it across decade long stanzas fly by so quickly the whole thing is over almost before you know it  
884,nick_and_norahs_infinite_playlist,tinny teens dragged through mirth free misadventures one new york night  like before sunrise or the lovely karaoke bar sequence at the center of lost in translation  nick and norah s infinite playlist captures the excitement of exploring a city with someone you barely know and really  really like  there s not much reality or intellect to be found  the movie around them may not have enough shape  contrast and texture  but at least these characters are always moving forward  even if the only sure thing they ve got to look forward to is dawn  
885,un_secret,a structural mess that turns contrived just when it should be hitting home  a blue chip cast and handsome stagings do little to prevent this french movie being a muddled  pretentious washout  substantial re editing might have helped  claude miller s ravishingly shot drama gives up its titular mystery early  but there s plenty of cinematic intrigue well after what s covert in this complicated family story becomes overt  
886,afterschool,at heart it s another unpleasant existential crisis for another unpleasant schoolboy in another unpleasant american prep school  
887,body_of_war,whatever you think of the film  body of war stirs up real admiration for its subject   tomas young  deserves better treatment from the government than he s gotten as a returning veteran  and a better movie than this simpleminded indictment of every senator who voted  yea   body of war again demonstrates that we americans still have some bitter truths to face  it is not merely an antiwar document  but a complex profile in courage of a paraplegic and patriot  body of war makes no bones about its activism  then again  like the others  it s the willingness to contextualize events and apply reason to them that makes it and others so valuable  editor bernadine colish weaves together all that c span footage into a disturbing procedural indictment  what makes body of war such a powerful documentary isn t the clever rhetorical device of debate vs  reality  but the way it documents american life in the  00s  architecturally sound  emotionally ravaging  a powerful argument against impetuous decisions  be they to join the military or to attack a country  
888,ashes_of_time_redux_2008,only in its final scenes do the usual wkw themes emerge in full bloom  but purists shouldn t miss it  provides a fascinating glimpse down a path perhaps advisedly not taken  
889,cherry_blossoms_hanami,at more than two hours  cherry blossoms could do with some pruning  
890,che_part_two,this plodding  one paced  dramatically inert movie is almost entirely surface description  the result  a second story less mumble in the jungle  is so exhaustingly over researched it can t see the wood for the trees   and  believe me  one thing you ll not feel short changed over is trees  like guevara s slog through the bolivian undergrowth  che part two is a hallucinatory journey into the heart of darkness  defined by a performance of great presence  saying that a film has too much insight is hardly damning  his film is brilliantly shot  capturing the chilly bareness of the landscapes through which the rebels yomp  but it s formalist and clinical to a degree that will challenge viewers eager to identify with the figures it depicts  soderbergh deserves all credit for attempting a very un hollywood project  an objective  forensic war film in the lineage of pontecorvo s the battle of algiers  and as benicio del toro is convincing as the warrior in decline  luckily for us  soderbergh is one of those rare directors who s able to make uninterrupted misery engaging  twice as long as it needs to be  but it is also only half the movie it should have been  
891,1194209-elegy,the stillness of the performances combined with coixet s direction  which takes it time  and that bloody piano tinkling and tinkling away make it all rather heavy going  makes you feel as if you ve just swum uphill through treacle  penelope cruz is outstanding in an otherwise lame male fantasy  elegy excels when it focuses solely on kingsley and cruz  two actors who inhabit these roles so completely that they re more interesting than the plot twists that surround them  
892,1174279-wanted,bekmambetov made better films in russia with far less money and more ideas  it s made for fans of films that really just want to see some great visuals  some amazing sequences and some terrific performances  if the graphic novel style hyperviolence of sin city or 300 is your thing  go ahead and knock yourself out  or let angelina do it for you     it feels so much nicer that way  directed at a pitch of gritty giddiness by the kazakhstan born timur bekmambetov  this hard r splatter fest about a team of sanctified assassins is also the summer s zazziest action movie  ultimately  watching wanted feels like being privy to somebody else s unwholesome fantasy  one you d rather not know about  wanted is fast moving and bloody  enjoyable even within its unapologetically generic limits  but mcavoy is its real secret weapon  that timur bekmambetov s amped up action flick wanted makes absolutely no sense is entirely irrelevant  your brain  in fact  can take a two hour hiatus  but your adrenal glands will be working overtime  when the characters are on the run  wanted can be a bloodthirsty crowdpleaser  a passable action flick to while away the summer hours  when they re explaining themselves  you almost wish they d stuck to their original calling and made rugs  not war  wanted s hyperkinetic antics are sometimes weighed down by a surfeit of adolescent misanthropy  but the adrenaline overdose strategy works for viewers as well as hit men  the film s high proficiency is at the service of a concept that can most accurately be defined as sadomasochistic  wanted is quite happy to judge a man by the size of his gun  the irony is that the biggest one here belongs to jolie  and her amazon smile indicates she knows exactly how nervous that makes the boys  
893,three_monkeys,three monkeys is a peculiarly nationalistic eulogy  because what lies at the heart of this nationalism isn t pride in national identity  but rather a quintessentially humanistic stance  it s a recognition of the people s ambivalence and failings  ceylan finds moments of stunning visual composition and his cast truly delivers  so art house audiences will more than likely be satisfied by three monkeys  even if it s not a knockout punch  an elegant exercise with four characters trapped by class  guilt and greed  there are enough ponderous moments that you may find yourself resisting the heavy mood  this is powerful filmmaking for discerning viewers  if you re looking for an adultery  and revenge fueled family melodrama so subdued that it keeps a hit and run fatality  cuckoldry  and murder entirely off screen  three monkeys is your movie and nuri bilge ceylan your not so genre inclined auteur  calling three monkeys a genre detour is putting it charitably  it s a downbeat dead end that reduces its talented maker to a mere shadow play stylist   the film s  hauntingly slow rhythms underscore the immanent violence and impotent rage that cripple already attenuated lives  at times while watching it  i found myself fidgeting  my patience for long stare offs exhausted  afterward  i couldn t stop thinking about it  long  masterfully executed shots accompanied by minimal dialogue and a richly expressive soundtrack  subdued performances punctuated by violent bursts of emotion  and a confident trust in the combination of stark realism and unadorned melodrama  despite the strong performances he obtains from his actors here  and the way he keeps piquing our curiosity with ellipses and ambiguities  the film is not powerful enough to get away with that elaborate story line  it is certainly an engrossing work  it looks wonderful and every frame is dense with intelligence  there are stabs of interest and insight in every scene  three monkeys  could be reduced to a simple moral   never do a dodgy politician a favour   though its layering of ironies and wrong turnings render it more subtly disturbing than that pr cis might suggest  
894,1197120-oss_117_cairo_nest_of_spies,impeccable standards  far above anything you d expect from the parody genre  a natty satire on imperialism and tr s visually stylish to boot  it constantly keeps you tickled with crazy one liners and silly visual gags  a lame comedy with a few decent laughs and several yawn spawning set pieces that don t really go anywhere  hubert bonisseur de la bath is invincibly smug  occasionally smarmy and obsessed with food  if that whets your appetite  he s your homme  
895,10010237-tokyo,paris  new york and even toronto have all gotten their due in a recent wave of city centric omnibus films that let world renowned auteurs run wild in their streets  yet none of these yielded anything as strange or as idiosyncratic as tokyo  perhaps it is inevitable as three foreign directors train their lenses on that unique island culture of the east that all three are propelled by fantasy or science fiction  and suggest more alienation from tokyo than affection for the great city  if you ve seen paris  je t aime or new york stories  you know the rate of return on these urban omnibuses is variable  and so it is here  go in expecting minor pleasures and you ll be fine  the overall project succeeds at offering three tantalizing films for the price of one movie ticket  worth seeing for anyone who calls themselves a fan of any of its directors or weird anthology films in general  isn t likely to make many best of 2009 lists  but its originality in an era of cookie cutter moviemaking is greatly appreciated  
896,headless_woman,an astounding portrait of a person entirely out of sync with her own existence  
897,girl_cut_in_two,notice how nimbly chabrol glides through his establishing scenes  and how adroitly he introduces other characters  
898,synecdoche_new_york,kaufman  who once dazzled us with his japester s invention  uses those same tools to do something else here  he leaves us reeling  synecdoche  new york finally feels bitter  hollow and adolescent  like a gargantuan music video conceived for an emo band with a penchant for pirandello  the controlled romantic madness of kaufman s best work becomes a world of symbolic and thematic promiscuity at once lifeless and inchoate  too many ideas interbreed as wit goes to the wall  loop the looping big themes such as mortality  infidelity and impotence  this is an hilarious  intellectual roller coaster ride you ll rush to take again  so dense  so complex and so downright puzzling that even kaufman fans may balk at it  it seems more like an illustration of his script than a full fledged movie  proving how much he needs a spike jonze or a michel gondry to realize his surrealistic conceits  a surreal exploration of art  love and death  it has the fellini esque feel of some lost european cinematic masterpiece that reaches far past the normal boundaries of drama and into the very essence of existence  
899,the_incredible_hulk,it won t change your life but you ll walk away smiling  
900,up,a hugely enjoyable work  whose care  craftsmanship and creative courage are rarely found in mainstream films   animated or otherwise  what s so impressive about up is that the film makers never lose sight of their adult concerns  the humour gets weirder as it goes on and it s among the lightest of pixar s films  but the first 20 minutes offer the saddest  most poignant sequence seen in an animation film since bambi s mother died  everything up does with quiet  time bestriding imagination is a triumph  up matches or surpasses pixar s previous hits like toy story  monsters inc and finding nemo  it shares their joyousness and visual flair  but for all its flights of fancy is more firmly rooted in the real  human world  the latest computer animated adventure from pixar studios has a simple premise that should enchant viewers of all ages  fusing childhood fantasies of escape with adult feelings of melancholy and regret  i m not as filled with the same helium for disney pixar s up as other critics  but i d be cruel if i wasn t lifted by the story of rediscovering a life of adventure  the movie is packed with lovely jokes  some of them funny in inexplicable ways  an exquisite work of cinematic art that also happens to be the funniest  most touching  most exciting and most entertaining movie released so far this year  its charms appear to have been applied with surgical precision  by the end  i felt expertly sutured  but not much else  to watch up with any attention is to be moved and astonished by the economy with which specific visuals are invested with emotion throughout  
901,the_hurt_locker,the action itself is episodic  with every ounce of tension eked from some stunning set pieces where lingering shots accentuate the bleak cinematography and stripped down sound design to draw the maximum heat and hopelessness of this hell on earth  
902,star_trek_11,aside from the cool effects and surprise cameos from notable actor director tyler perry and one of the u s s  enterprise s original passengers leonard nimoy  there really wasn t much there  whether watching kirk and sulu skydive from space  a rural mid west dotted with vast interstellar towers  or kirk do battle with a very ill tempered beastie on a frozen moon  it s hard not to gape in wonder  did somebody just reach through the space time continuum and pull out a white rabbit  well  at least they got it half right  this star trek essentially turns out to be a war film  with the occasional philosophical timeout to discuss love  friendship  and duty until the next bone crunching fistfight or multi weapon rumble with the romulans  the young cast is mostly callow and tv bland and the special effects don t quite seem worth that hefty price tag  but overall this is a presentable addition to the franchise  what i do have a problem with is sacrificing plot for speed  for thinking that grand spectacle and a great sense of pop culture are all that you need to make a new journey with the crew of the enterprise work  in his daft  dizzy reinvention of a moribund franchise  abrams has found a way to be referential without being reverential  to conjure nostalgia without being constrained by it  
903,anvil_the_story_of_anvil,while it s undoubtedly comical and touching  a pall of middle aged gloom hovers over the antics of canada s longest surviving death metal band  the music  heard in economical proportions  is secondary to the unexpectedly deep bond between its creators  their story is an underdog s triumph that s difficult to deny  see anvil  if you love heavy metal  because these guys are legends  see anvil  if you don t love heavy metal because this story is legendary  cute if predictable  gervasi has tapped into a powerful if much overlooked truth  humanity rocks  anvil  the story of anvil can t help but evoke this is spinal tap  the classic 1984 mockumentary directed by the other rob reiner  in terms of both sheer hair metal ludicrousness and indignities suffered by a not so successful rock band on the road  anvil  is one of the sweetest  funniest films i ve seen this year  also the loudest and most foulmouthed  
904,afghan_star,while its style and structure conform to the well worn template established by docs like spellbound  its success lies in creating an accessible  fun way into serious issues  this eye opening film reveals that even systems as dubious as the idol format mean dramatically different things when transferred to radically dissimilar cultures  
905,1197696-fantastic_mr_fox,the same eye for immaculate compositions that had seemed increasingly to hem in his human actors here serves as the basis for some of the most inventive animated set pieces this side of nick park  
906,drag_me_to_hell,there s something fundamentally disappointing about watching raimi use his considerable resources to just make more wonderful scat  
907,district_9,blomkamp is good at mustering speedy action and posting grisly sight gags in the background  carnage always hovering comically at the edge of your vision  but i m not sure that district 9 entirely gets the earthling racism out of its own system  district 9 has too many gory vaporizations to qualify as a serious statement on race relations  but it does outclank transformers  revenge of the fallen by a wide margin  and you thrill to the cleanly cut action sequences  perhaps we re witnessing a new dawn for politically engaged sci fi and horror  with blomkamp as a latter day george romero  either way  this is a stunningly impressive debut  a thundering blitzkrieg of seat rattling entertainment with a sociopolitical message  a cerebral sci fi and apartheid allegory that is as heavily armed with provocative ideas as it is with armour piercing  tank splattering torpedoes  an entertaining  technically superb if faintly unsatisfying futuristic thriller  fiendishly plotted and with awesomely kinetic  and outrageously bloody  action scenes  blomkamp announces himself in a major way  without letting the third act crescendo lose focus in a blur of noise  director neill blomkamp expertly marshals the action  and although the climactic exchanges settle into familiar territory  he provokes genuine moral outrage  district 9 is a south african sci fi b movie that punches well above its weight even as it falls back on inspiration from major league precedents  district 9 socks you with humour  gore and fast paced action and it never feels worthy  while delivering an unexpectedly touching reflection on man s inhumanity to man  movie lightning has struck here  big time  because if this isn t what an instant sci fi classic looks like   it ll do until the next instant sci fi classic gets here  
908,inglourious_basterds,qt has let loose completely  flashes of cine genius curdle with crude  crazy juvenility  although it doesn t stop this being his most purely enjoyable film since kill bill  vol  1  
909,precious,when discussing comedians who became dramatic actors  oscar winners robin williams and jamie foxx come to mind  as do jim carrey and steve carell  but none had a more extreme transformation than mo nique for precious  
910,up_in_the_air_2009,not only is this a rare hollywood production that offers as much substance and panache as the cream of current us tv  i d go further and say its cynical wit almost places it in the billy wilder bracket  a witty  often delightful  adult love story that deserves most of the oscar love it will surely get  that it s also glib will help rather than hinder its chances in march  what begins as a surprisingly successful mixture of michael clayton and intolerable cruelty eventually skirts uncomfortably close to the as yet unfilmed epilogue to planes  trains and automobiles  a brilliantly astute twist on the romcom that sparkles with spiky one liners and outstanding performances  
911,in_the_loop,you probably wouldn t want to spend three hours listening to alan partridge s drive time radio broadcast  but this idiotic dj delivers a solid 90 minutes of cinematic entertainment  the performances are outstanding  and there are many laugh out loud moments as confirmed by the fact that i laughed out loud  this alleged satire  which received four star treatment from other critics  left me with a ho hum and sorry feeling that i had wasted an evening seeing it  prepare yourself for an hour and a half of political farce made only funnier by the fact that these ludicrous actions and explanations all feel so terrifyingly plausible  every movie that clearly tells us how we marched toward the war  through bullying  intimidation  and making opponents seem crazy is worth seeing  
912,an_education,the movie belongs to mulligan  whose jenny looks like audrey hepburn when she puts her hair up and dons a black dress  and like every teenage girl who s had her heart broken when she cries  danish director scherfig and star mulligan give the film considerable weight by surrounding this lightly played  strange romance with both an acute understanding of barber s endearing screen alter ego  this is a wonderful  life affirming picture that deserves all the prizes it will undoubtedly win  i can t call it the best british film of the year because it s still only october  but i d be amazed if a better one comes along  
913,coraline,coraline never stops taking artistic risks  i hope there s a brave enough audience out there willing to take the plunge  some scary fun  
914,1208882-cove,a taut  thrilling documentary that plays out like a heist movie while never overshadowing its message or activist credentials  there s an effective thriller element to this vividly assembled doc  it is put together so smartly you can almost feel the urgency   from the patient set up  which lays on the information and statistics without getting boring or too preachy  to the horrific finale  
915,cell-211,spanish prison movie cell 211 is a winner if you re a fan of the nail biting real time thriller  using deception  undercover work and con artistry to deliver violence and heart pounding scenes  a satisfyingly intense and suitably incendiary prison drama that keeps the viewer tightly handcuffed during its first hour before falling victim to the fraud of improbability  from spanish director daniel monzon  this is a white hot prison drama with a byzantine plot and enough gore to make reservoir dogs look like a petting zoo  it s a cut above the usual penal picture  intelligent with sharply drawn  memorable characters  a storyline suffused with tension and unexpected turns  and a morass of moral quandaries that could lead the most innocent into irretrievable darkness  there is something melodramatic and soapy about cell 211 occasionally  but it really is exciting monzn s film remains a bracing draft for a great thriller  not the finished article  the twisty plot soon gets knotted  but in the process shows a deeply broken system born of violence and corruption  an outstanding thriller  with enough political and character strokes to lift it out of the straight genre category   but rough and tough enough to stand alongside any given hollywood hardman buddy vehicle  celda 211  cell 211  requires you to look past a couple of contrivances in order to enjoy its main scenario  how quickly can the ruinous nature of prison life corrupt an innocent  moral man  nearly every minute throbs with heart pounding suspense  from the opening scene of a prisoner slashing his wrists with a razor blade fashioned from a cigarette filter to its mournful  blood soaked conclusion  it s the kind of gutsy  physical performance that wins academy awards for daniel day lewis  but ammann is just as impressive as a man who must suddenly test his limits and values  
916,song_of_sparrows,it is somehow congenial to feel that we are watching a tale that could have been told elsewhere  if you can look past the almost silent era sermonizing of the song of sparrows  you can see something else at work here  and deeper things on view  while the film incorporates a touch of neo realism  iranian director majid majidi isn t aiming for miserablism  his beautifully austere morality tale is more a sun parched version of a different well known story  the film is pleasingly meandering  till the more typically majidian soulful and teary eyed climax  the story  spiked with gentle humor  moves smoothly through the standard tropes of iranian art house cinema  
917,sweetgrass,even viewers caught unaware of just how natural this documentary is could easily find themselves mesmerized by its unique charms  
918,food_inc,this solidly constructed documentary aims to do for food production what an inconvenient truth did for global warming  concerned with entertainment value as well as clarity and punch  he uses lots of colourful graphics  and moves quickly from one aspect of his subject to another  overused narration treats the audience like the cattle being abused on screen  a continuous score rams the message home  just in case we missed the point    compelling  entertaining and illuminating documentary which makes you think twice  and then a few more times  about eating anything at all in u s  if you are what you eat  we are mostly genetically modified  poorly regulated  unhealthy meat byproducts generating profits for a few gargantuan corporations  a riveting if distressing look at the essentially unregulated american food supply  the result is an alarming film that tackles food and freedom of speech issues on many fronts  this absorbing film looks terrific and does a superb job of making its case that our current food ways are drastically out of whack  if wal mart  the lucifer of multinational corporations in many liberal eyes  sees the fiscal sense in stocking an increasingly wide array of organic foodstuffs  consumer habits truly are changing  
919,revanche, it works because spielmann has established that we re not watching belabored dramatic trajectories collide  but an encounter between two people in miles away mindsets   spielmann s deft storytelling is coupled with immaculate compositions that constrain the characters as confidently as any prison bars  
920,tulpan,dvortsevoy exhibits the storytelling composure and technical proficiency of a veteran  while his keen eye for a pastoral poetic flourish places  tulpan  firmly among the year s most endearing cinematic experiences  feels more like something from national geographic than a feature film  for some  the lamb birthing scene will be a steppe too far  with a deadpan charm all its own  tulpan ends up dealing with some fairly serious questions on the order of how you make peace with a dream  to certain serious world cinema aficionados  tulpan s combination of understated comedy and documentary level depiction of rural kazakh life will be catnip  
921,zombieland,inspiration is pretty fallow after about half an hour  yet there are moments of sheer inventive genius that left me amazed  
922,good_hair,mr rock is one proud  if heartbroken  daddy and also a lovely  free wheeling guide through african american  afro hating hair culture  all christopher guest allusions aside  this is a crucial documentary about race and gender today  despite dozens of interviews and rock s personal agenda  this isn t the hard hitting expose it should have been  rock fronts this informative rummage through the  9 billion us black hair industry in a style much like his stand up comedy  hilarious  insightful and charming enough to let him get away with the flammable stuff  rock sheds new light on this old story through a poignant mix of interviews  investigation and his trademark satire  it s funny  clever and marginally educational  you can tell your friends you went to a documentary without having felt as if you saw one  it s rich food for thought  though you wonder why little attention is given to the idea that perhaps some women relax their hair because it s easier to style that way  or that elaborate attention to hair is hardly exclusive to black women  good hair is certainly no arid anthropological study  rock s queries are loose and quippy  but his instincts are as sharp as an investigative journalist s  rock takes aim at the truth and humor of this potent cultural question with a sharp wit and lively curiousity  even if he doesn t pursue vigorously enough its uglier side  good hair  directed by longtime rock collaborator jeff stilson  is such a rollicking  thoroughly entertaining ride that it s easy to take for granted just how easy rock makes it look  this entertaining exploration of black hair issues will get your dander up  
923,daniel_ellsberg_doc,it s a bit surprising that a documentary with such an unwieldy title offers such a streamlined and resonant account of history  ehrlich and goldsmith carve out their own little place in the canon by focusing on the ethical journey of one man who refused to shrug off his own responsibility for the war and atoned for it with a seismic act of civil disobedience  the lessons of the most dangerous man in america are not merely about war  they are about life and human behavior  efficiently wedding archival footage to contemporary interviews  co directors judith ehrlich and rick goldsmith take a chronological approach to ellsberg s journey of courage  in another time and culture  a story on this scale would deserve an opera  fortunately  the staunchly committed and controversial ellsberg  now 78  is still around to tell his history making tale  and he lends the film gravitas as both its persuasive narrator and primary talking head  dangerous man does a serviceable job of mapping out the particulars of his struggle  but the definitive cinematic version of his too strange for fiction story has yet to be made  his  treason  gave credence to ending the war  helped push a corrupt administration toward its ruin and underlined the importance of the first amendment  rickety doc or not  ellsberg deserves every ounce of hero worship he gets here  it s a professional job  standing above the crowd of politico documentaries that proliferate like kudzu over arthouse screens  so many people risked their livelihoods to put the 7 000 page pentagon papers out there    although its most tangible result was the creation of nixon s plumbers unit  we have not celebrated daniel ellsberg enough  let s begin  
924,somers_town,turgoose continues to convince as a kid whose personality wavers daily if not hourly  while jagiello playfully suggests that marek is becoming the perfect straight man  somers town is a small scale jewel that will surprise you with its buoyant look at blighted lives  somers town is a funny and endearing character comedy whose extra brief  70 minute running time proves perfectly adequate for its slender  episodic story  a small but important film about small but important lives  the latest drama from shane meadows further confirms that more people should know about this gifted director  it is proof that there are all sorts of teenage lives going on in britain  and sometimes  their most magical moments take place on dead end streets  shane meadows has been busily carving out his own corner in british cinema  shane meadows has a rare ability to convey the drama and humor of everyday life in well observed  well acted scenes that rarely drag on interminably or try too hard to dazzle  as a result  he has not only been able to stick two fingers up to the anti pole hate mongers of the popular press  and to create an enchanting portrait of growing up in a british city  he has made his best film to date  
925,goodbye_solo,utterly engrossing dual character study  unfolding with a serene disregard for indie quirkiness  goodbye solo radiates authenticity  working to a spare screenplay  bahrani offers none of the usual clues about either the cabbie s surprising determination to prevent the tragedy or the old man s reasons for suicide  this doesn t always help the quiet drama  an endearing character piece shot through with beauty and humility in which  thanks to his leads  open  sometimes vulnerable performances  tolerance and respect take precedence  an instantly gripping  funny  quietly persuasive drama that held me from the first frames  if cinematic form follows cinematic function then goodbye solo is a perfect mercedes of a movie  it is comprised of a quietly purring but powerful narrative engine  the raptures that greeted ramin bahrani s goodbye solo at festivals last year are wholly deserved  it s touching in its way  though bahrani s writing is not nearly as strong as his visual sense  and the denouement is perhaps too understated for its own good  the lack of melodrama coupled with moments of quiet celebration make goodbye solo a more uplifting tale than one might expect with such a less than joyous premise  
926,summer_hours,assayas  script is more allusive than demonstrative  with a distinct whiff of eric rohmer in its conversational blocks separated by fadeouts  evocative look at a family trying to decide what to do with its treasures  performances in this small and profoundly eloquent film are superb  yet none redirects attention from assayas s earnest meditation on the ravaging effects of a shrinking world on family traditions and entrenched personal relationships  summer hours begins with an energetic treasure hunt  it ends reminding us how our lives are spent learning and unlearning what is to be treasured  i think you should see summer hours  you won t find filmmaking more assured  commanding and evocative than that of summer hours in its opening scenes  a sweet pearl of a french film  summer hours may work as a perfect antidote for those seeking refuge from the summer blockbuster season  the texture and flow of summer hours  the supple quality of the acting  the fluid camerawork isolating this or that observer while life flows on and domestic crises ebb and flow    it all comes together as formidably detailed and easy breathing cra if this enjoyable film is substantially more satisfying than those predecessors  it s also far less daring  a straightforward extended family drama in the mode of last year s  more engrossing  art house highlight a christmas tale  quietly and keenly observed  berling  binoche and renier all play off each other effortlessly  and summer hours makes you feel comfortable spending time with their family  too  one realizes the real dramatic conflict is between the past  which must be honored  and the present  which must be lived  
927,crazy_heart,crazy heart feels familiar  even comforting  offering few surprises but a wealth of lovingly crafted  immaculately judged  wholly authentic emotion  the first time writer director scott cooper sets a gentle  unhurried pace as he unfolds the story  
928,10011003-crude,not exactly genre bending innovation or anything but a decent documentary about an important episode in history of oil company exploitation  
929,1209767-mary_and_max,the mixture of artistic sophistication and emotional crudeness cancel each other out  
930,ponyo,an arresting work from an unmistakable film making personality  if you want to see something suitable for all ages that will dazzle you sideways and remind you of the awesome power of animation done right  you should see this  
931,a_serious_man,does have its delicious moments and michael stuhlbarg does give an excellent  exasperated  frazzled lead performance    but without any warmth or expansiveness it all seems too cruelly easy and shrivelling somehow  see this movie for a good laugh  and know that no matter what s going on in your life  a serious man proves things can certainly get worse  if you re puzzled by the coen brothers  horrific comedies  this is the closest thing you ll get to an explanation  admirably low key  deeply compelling and their warmest movie since fargo  the film s potency is rooted in quiet precision and detailed realisation  roger deakins s typically polished photography gives an oppressively hard edge to midwestern suburbia  another impudent and exquisitely engineered comedy from joel and ethan coen  
932,tokyo_sonata, h ere  perhaps more urgently than ever before  it s about what happens when people confront the world outside  and what new  fragile connections they might begin to forge  kurosawa s first domestic drama is music to general audience s ears  a skilful and continually surprising drama  tokyo sonata depicts the gradual deterioration of an ordinary japanese family after its breadwinner loses his job owing to corporate downsizing  kiyoshi kurosawa switches gears from supernatural horror to poignant social satire  the true excellence of the film stems from how clearly kurosawa makes us see something of ourselves in these characters  each performance in this plaintive work is superb  but kyoko koizumi s gently melancholy portrait of the businessman s wife keeps tokyo sonata true and affecting  we believe we know where tokyo sonata is going  we are wrong  so strong a director is kurosawa that he not only can get away with piling on disasters but makes his picture all the more powerful as a result  known for distinctive horror movies like cure and pulse  inventive japanese filmmaker kiyoshi kurosawa finds just the right melancholy tone to suit a new and all too familiar kind of horror  economic downsizing  
933,moon,simple and alien free example of the sci fi genre  slow  but there are so many details deserving attention  the chance to take them all in one only enhances the experience  start calculating the costs to lunar industries of its singular form of devaluing  and moon s central premise stops making sense  moon is an old fashioned sci fi movie in the best sense  far more psychological drama than space opera  dispensing with overweening cgi and loud flashy action sequences while harking back to subtler  more ideas driven entries in the genre  while some of it is clearly inspired by other material  director jones spins this yarn into something unique and fresh and new and exhilarating  moon actually gets a little dull in the later reels  just when it should be peaking in mystery and tension  this is science fiction at its stimulating best  by halfway the film starts to feel like a mere exercise  one more effort to get maximum value from limited resources  too much machinery  not enough dread  an eccentric sci fi which cleverly deconstructs the mythology of the star treks and star wars which have colonised the future of our imaginations with their glamour  self importance and operatic sound tracks  they do make  em like they used to   a fresh blast of old school sci fi  bursting with ideas and a stellar turn from rockwell  the film is not entirely logical  but it raises pleasing questions and looks beautiful  a heartfelt  if self consciously derivative drama of human loneliness  psychedelic sci fi  glam rock goes off world  no  wordy and overwrought like a radio play in space  an indie sci fi movie  that s what the director duncan jones has put together  to mostly inspired effect  it s not fair to say that the film runs out of steam towards the end  because it remains crisp and unpredictable  but it does have the feel of an addictive outer limits episode finding ways to stretch itself over the feature length mark  
934,damned_united,moves along crisply with  mercifully  very little on pitch football and many beautifully crafted  touching moments  the story should have added up to an interesting and exciting movie  but it didn t for me  it was not due to sheen s acting  but rather to a boring and confusing script  the damned united eliminates the existential anguish and pain that propelled peace s novel  and curtails its lowering style  offering just enough football to satisfy the fans in the stands  the damned united is also a pleasingly high quality british drama with some terrific performances  tou don t need to know your arsenal from your hull to appreciate the one fact of life that clough learns too late  pride comes before a fall  and the pitch provides no safe haven from the excesses of the self  one of  its  primary pleasures   is that  in choosing a topic as narrow and parochial as the fate of an english soccer club  morgan has relieved himself of any duty to persuade us that the events he describes are of world historical import  a finely constructed and fiercely entertaining soccer movie that deals more in pride and obsession than penalty kicks   michael sheen  adds to his gallery of public figures  tony blair  david frost  with a sharp performance here as the legendary uk soccer coach brian clough  while there s plenty of action  much of it satisfyingly wet and muddy  the reason to watch this film is its splendid cast  thanks to michael sheen s innate charms  brian clough is redeemable even at his meanest and most self destructive  sheen s performance is controlled fury  barely touching ground as he presents clough as being the very picture of a delusional fool  while it s true that a couple of the characters are vivid creations  it s hard to glean what else morgan sees in this story  which he adapted from a novel by david peace  besides a showcase for sheen  mostly  that s enough  the enigma of brian clough has long fascinated british fans  the dammed united offers no easy explanation  but plunges into the mysteries of the personality  
935,adventureland,content to occupy that middle ground where insights are authentic but far from revelatory and comedy is more amiable than riotous  
936,10011016-messenger,an intelligent and well acted film which deserves its outing here  the oscar nominated script pursues a grimly honourable task into its grim and not always honourable byways  harrelson gives us layers of hurt under a callous yet needy crust  it may be the best performance of his career and certainly deserves oscar consideration  
937,1203291-under_the_sea_3d,under the sea 3d is a beautiful reminder that movies can take us to places we ve never been before  there are still worlds to conquer out there that don t require the gussying up of cgi effects to hold our attention  if you re not taking the family on an exotic beach vacation anytime soon  consider this a reasonable alternative  this is a raw  brutal arena of cold eyed predators chomping the weakest and inexpressibly ugly beings that have evolved so as to be disturbingly well camouflaged  utterly invisible until they make a deadly lunge at some poor vulnerable little fishy  here to inspire awe and depression with a vast universe of marine life that  barring possible ecological disaster  will be here eons after we re gone  after 40 minutes behind 3 d glasses watching rare aquatic creatures  why bother with airline tickets and scuba gear  
938,la_nana,deadpan  handheld technique allows director sebasti n silva to mine mundane situations for subtle hazard but also to take his story in unexpected directions  initial reticence preserving the potential for surprise  writer director sebastian silva wisely focuses on character instead of caricature and has crafted a film that is surprisingly moving by the time it reaches its bittersweet final act  the tension doesn t just derive from wondering where the story s going to go but to which genre this movie even belongs  are we in a horror film or a humanist drama  will raquel burst into tears or break out the knives  
939,every_little_step,we should be kneeling on concrete to remind ourselves what dues these artists pay  
940,yoo_hoo_mrs_goldberg,we re left with an impression of a vivacious pioneer  but warm shouldn t have to mean fuzzy  kempner has a real gift for making these almost forgotten lives fascinating and vital  this generally excellent portrait does much to fill the void  restoring an unfortunately forgotten figure to her rightful place among broadcasting s trailblazers  this wonderful doc about radio and tv icon gertrude berg is a cornucopia of nostalgia for viewers of a certain age  
941,red_cliff,cleaner and probably more rewatchable than red cliff 2  a formidable prelude to an epic battle with resplendent effects and action spectacles  woo has re embraced his chinese roots with brutal commitment  flaws and all  you can t watch a frame of it without feeling that it has been generations since hollywood tackled anything on this scale  it s a historical war movie with impressive sweep  strong characterizations and the kind of idiosyncratic flourishes that made woo such an irresistible storyteller  what remains is still plenty rousing  especially to moviegoers eager to see woo regain his footing after an increasingly dismal series of outings in hollywood  i loved watching red cliff from a purely technical level but never cared about it on a human one  from landscape shots that have the serene beauty of a han dynasty watercolor  to its dramatic naval engagements and thundering cavalry charges  this is magnificent filmmaking  and a magnificent film  returning to his roots after a stint in hollywood  woo has made the most expensive film in mainland chinese history  a pleasantly traditional picture that marks a new direction for one of the world s premier action maestros  
942,of_time_and_the_city,and  by being so personal in a way that s so honest and so incisive  davies indirectly offers national commentary that s relevant far  far beyond his old merseyside doorstep 
943,in_search_of_beethoven,tells the story of its subject in a clear  accessible  and gimmick free manner while still preserving  or perhaps even cultivating  a core sense of wonder at the creative monuments he bequeathed to us all  after the monotonous guide through history that was in search of mozart  phil grabsky s follow up plays like a much needed shot of adrenaline to the brain  beethoven s painful insecurities and petty squabbles are deftly balanced with generous musical examples  beautifully lensed and intelligently crafted  this sprawling  if somewhat overlong  film finds a level of discussion that should please aficionados and newcomers alike   a  highly entertaining and informative biography  presenting beethoven as a working artist rather than a caricatured grumpy genius  at such length and in such detail  there are certainly dramas to describe and insights to be had  but a film this static and self important doesn t really do them justice  one wallow does not make a summer  but the combined forces of ludwig s music and a chorus of celebrity erudition should help to take your mind off the april cacophony elsewhere  
944,harry_potter_and_the_half_blood_prince,i think it s the best of the series  fairly easily  and a testament to why occasionally throwing a massive budget at an endeavor of this scope can be considered a reasonable decision  if harry potter and the half blood prince is a roller coaster  it s the tiny train meant for only the very youngest kids  the one that seems to go round and round forever without really ever picking up any pace  director david yates presides over some gorgeous cgi set pieces  but all the real magic comes from the scrum of ace british character actors  with its deft handling of teen yearning and affection  half blood prince maneuvers mysteries of heart and hankering that resound in worlds magic and muggle  david yates is a solid hand as director  he does nothing but let the taps run  leaving us with little more than a bath full of comfortable if lukewarm water  it s a more mature magic      now subject to the same raging hormones as any other 16 year olds  our spell casting heroes are learning to brew love potions this year  with results mostly played for laughs  darker  more hormonal  more teenage angsty and sadly more boring  dear me  what a dull fight this has become  at points in harry potter and the half blood prince i feared slipping into a persistent vegetative state  to say that hp6 is light on incident is like saying that the new transformers film occasionally gets a wee bit noisy  understatement of the frickin  quidditch season  for non readers  the films are now borderline incomprehensible  because so much prior knowledge is assumed  but i understand from loyal book readers that  especially in this new film  a great deal of important incident has been deleted  who would have thought  after five movies and so much hype  that the sixth harry potter movie would be better than most of its predecessors  
945,il_divo,a stunning piece of work that feels both familiar and completely unique at the same time  after i saw il divo  i suppose i should have felt indignation  i suppose i should also have felt that way after  the godfather   but such films present such mesmerizing figures that i simply regard them  astonished  a must see for political junkies of any nationality  il divo is best appreciated as the bizarre character study of an essentially unlovable man who somehow became one of his country s most successful leaders  simultaneously exhilarating and confounding  dazzling and confusing  this is filmmaking of such verve and style that you likely won t care that you can t follow it completely  you need know nothing about italian politics to completely enjoy the fantastical  fellini fied  tragi comic  biographical fun for all il divo  so much half digested information is expelled  so many key incidents skate by  that the effect is like being force fed a history lesson you never wanted to sit through in the first place  as operatic cinema  it ranks alongside the best of martin scorsese and francis ford coppola  sorrentino s directorial flourishes are at least partly to blame for the lack of clarity  his ornate setpieces are frequently dazzling  but as they pile up over two hours  they wind up distracting as often as they illuminate  il divo taps into something that s indeed borderless  americans recognize political corruption and backroom conspiracies even if we don t intimately know the players  sorrentino s version of andreotti s story is thus only really fascinating as a bloated vanity project  one that is unlikely to win him many new american defenders  a baroque high comedy of endemic corruption  il divo doesn t treat the early  90s scandal that brought down italian prime minister giulio andreotti as a tragedy  thriller  or tale of long delayed comeuppance  but with resigned wit and florid carica 
946,everlasting_moments,what makes the photographer s story so compelling is that her life s work actually does come alive onscreen  mischa gavrjusjov keys the camera work to the characters  moods  inky blacks portending a thunderous alcoholic outburst  golden washes signaling the heroine s late blooming  superficially interesting in many ways but this doesn t really engage on a deeper level  troell s film meshes scenes of high drama and silent contemplation while the milky  sepia toned super16 photography lends the images an exquisite  tactile quality  it s a mark of troell s mastery that we could happily have borne another half hour of his mesmerising yarn  troell s film manages to fascinate yet never convinces us of its necessity  a movie like everlasting moments comes along maybe once in a decade   director  troell lovingly re creates a time when socialism and charlie chaplin movies represented the ways forward  and he anchors his social panorama in the meek  stubborn stare of an unnoticed woman possessed with looking at everything  the three principal actors are powerfully effective  particularly heiskanen  everlasting moments offers such breadth and complexity it can be forgiven exceeding its grasp  in fact  it should be applauded for doing so  it s gloriously absent of the hyper speed anxiety that passes for storytelling on our multiplex screens  
947,avatar,learning your visuals from jack kirby is one thing  but too often it sounds like cameron learned to write dialogue from the guy too  cameron knows the viewer will recognize avatar s story from elsewhere  whether as the love affair between john smith and pocahontas or almost all of ferngully and so tries to dazzle the viewer with  shock and awe   i had the feeling coming out of this movie that i haven t felt since maybe i was eleven years old in 1977 and i saw star wars for the first time  
948,500_days_of_summer,the principals perform their roles nicely  but there really isn t much for them to do  undoubtedly  the age gap has influenced my negative response  an unpredictable  immensely satisfying experience  much like love itself  it s very smooth and well done  marc webb clearly has a solid visual eye and natural sense of pacing  it is hardly the freshest romantic comedy of the past 20 years  taking the best bits from other movies and rearranging them in a non linear sequence does not make for an original film  despite clever moments and hornbyesque touches of melancholy  it s let down by sitcom cliches  and by being weirdly incurious about the inner life of its female lead  an ideal version of this film would be painful and playful  and a good deal less cluttered  but the one we get certainly has delightful moments  after any exposure to this year s unfailingly smelly mainstream romcoms  it s a breeze  comparisons with woody allen are misplaced   the lines don t punch the way woody s used to   but the cinematography does a good job of making unfashionable corners of los angeles look like allen s manhattan  this is a romantic comedy that makes the concept of romantic comedies appealing again    that reminds you how resonant and transporting they can be when they re done right  it isn t hugh and andie or meg and whomever  but  500  days offers hope that hollywood can pass that romance baton to somebody other than the crude crew of the kappa alpha apatow frat house  
949,etz_limon,a touch too neat but fittingly tart  riklis is ultimately unable to center his attention on any one of its multiple fissures and reflexively allows lemon tree to rest on its aura of subliminal female solidarity  
950,1207748-katyn,it is serious film making of the most noble intent and it strenuously attacks the state ideologies that continue to legitimise war crimes  katyn is a solemn  troubling film that makes necessary demands on its audience  wajda employs a full range of sweeping shots and orchestral cues to ramp up the emotion  although he s often guilty of sacrificing the intimacy of character for the grander narrative of history  katyn is solidly  skilfully told  but away from these living graveside scenes  wajda s own artistic bones seem too well upholstered at 83  though it would be hard to call it life affirming  it is too riven with grief and horror for that  too aware of what poland has suffered for it to be anything but a deeply sombre memorial  there s the odd breathtakingly composed shot  chilling scenario and exquisitely poignant turn from the overpopulated cast but the sombrely indulgent pacing betrays the fact that acclaimed director andrzej wajda is now aged 83  if polish  german and russian sound roughly the same to you  and i can t tell them apart from klingon  then you re in for two long and confusing hours  friendo  the great filmmaker s urge to show generations of his countrymen what they were told not to think about is what moves him  and while  katyn  rises above didacticism  you can feel the director keeping his emotions in check throughout  
951,1218217-single_man,fashion designer tom ford proves he s no one trick pony with this astonishing directorial debut  
952,10009823-sin_nombre,captivatingly naturalistic performances and cinematography almost makes up for the lack of a larger political framework  as vibrantly coloured and in your face visceral as you d expect  a woozy  punch out shot makes you feel like it s your own head hitting the dirt  fukunaga paints better outside the lines  working with cinematographer adriano goldman to offer vivid shots of the poverty and despair cutting through latin america  intense spanish language feature debut intrigues but doesn t quite gel  
953,1196003-princess_and_the_frog,the princess and the frog will certainly be remembered years later as not only a pioneer disney movie  but also one that allowed audiences to never let go of their dreams and that with love anything is possible  no matter your age or color  the backgrounds are beautifully drawn  there are sunny days in the french quarter  spooky nights among live oaks hung with spanish moss  and a rousing denouement at the mardi gras  if the film boasts any advantages over digital  it s in the pastel richness of its colours and the elasticity of its characters  who enjoy a degree of comic flexibility and range of expressions we still don t get from computers  the nineteen twenties jazz age setting and the primal adventure storytelling are boilerplate disney  scrubbed clean of any real local color  randy newman s songs are a little too blandly randy newman ish and the story is uneven  but there are some great characters  some even better jokes  a general sense of good humour and that entrancing  eye ravishing old school animation  the closest yet that disney s traditional 2 d animation has come to threatening the supremacy of the computer generated pixar style tales  intermittently appealing and great to look at  this doesn t add up to classic disney  but it s heaps better than the gruesome home on the range  which looked to be the last gasp of these old style toons  it proves there s life in dem bones yet  new orleans is as exhaustively filled in as pixar s imagined worlds  disney have turned the funeral march for old school animation into a jolly hand crafted pageant that shows vibrant signs of life even in the age of avatar  disney are back doing hand drawn animation  and despite a slightly stuttering start to shake off the cobwebs  they re still doing it very well  this movie doesn t just concern itself with magic  it is magic  pure joy and rapturous glee oozing off of every frame  most of the princess and the frog looks more like one of disney s straight to dvd sequels than like their animated classics  and the few big  fun musical set pieces are brought down by second rate songwriting  
954,1213731-worlds_greatest_dad,we can t wait to see what goldthwait does next  goldthwait s script turns into a surprisingly restrained  focused sendup of the blind adulation often bestowed on flawed personalities once they croak too soon  offering robin williams his richest role in memory while serving up a nice cold bowl of shock soup for the audience  world s greatest dad is a surprisingly smart and severely twisted dark comedy from comic bobcat goldthwait  with his delicate mix of sick humor and compassion  goldthwait is that rare comic writer who can legitimately be compared to lenny bruce  there s more going on here than the age old struggle between maturity and its surly teen antithesis  who could have guessed that a cat named bobcat could write a screenplay or direct a film as refreshingly sensitive as this one  
955,the_girl_with_the_dragon_tattoo_2009,an engrossing and classically suspenseful story 
956,1193230-state_of_play,represents mainstream hollywood filmmaking at its best  
957,bad_lieutenant_port_of_call_new_orleans,i d rather rot in a new orleans jail than watch it again  and yet its epiphanies are outrageously sharp  it is beautifully shot by cinematographer peter zeitlinger and the ending is a joy  in fusing european experimentalism and hollywood boldness  herzog has created a genuine oddity  a furious and unforgettable hybrid which may well prove to be 2010 s most purely enjoyable moviegoing experience  as always with herzog  the more eccentric scenes have an eerie  hilarious mastery  and only someone with the metaphysical  lan of herzog could pull off a film noir that takes place mostly in fierce sunlight  
958,seraphine,s raphine doesn t mess with the formula but the script allows plenty of awkward details to remain and we re allowed to decide for ourselves if fame was a godsend for her  
959,white_ribbon,suffice it to say that i don t understand the rave reviews that this picture received  and i was not a happy camper when i left the theater  far from enjoyable escapism  the white ribbon is nonetheless utterly compelling and quite beautiful in its unsettling presentation of this prosaic evil  writer director michael haneke doesn t pull any punches  but then he doesn t throw any wild ones  either  his filmmaking shows precisely the sort of obsession with control that the movie itself is denouncing  interesting  you ve got to admit  haneke has dramatized his intellectual conceits in an uninvolving  snail paced movie that illustrates its themes in an obvious  almost banal manner  it is a haunting parable with no real beginning and no easy conclusion  and like life s memories it is the meaning behind events that linger long past recriminations and accusations faded into the dark  the visuals lend an air of eerie calm to the disturbing series of attacks that begin to infect the town s serene and self righteous surface  the quintessential art film  slow  demanding  and rewarding for those willing to put forth the intellectual effort necessary to puzzle out its ambiguities  there s no denying this is a coldly commanding tale in which haneke s signature obsessions simmer quietly as subtext before bursting into the open in the final reels  the film  even while drawing us into its creepy web  also disappoints

962,1203732-me_and_orson_welles,christian mckay delivers a stand out performance in two of the best escapist hours you ll experience this year  i ve seen plenty of great impersonations of orson welles and yet i ve never seen any of them come remotely close to this  a film that nearly everyone will enjoy on their own terms but it s also surprisingly bland considering the larger than life personality that gives it half a title  linklater has crafted an always genial and at times even joyful period charmer about that moment on the cusp  before a boy becomes a man and another man becomes a mythological figure  it s an open question as to who  outside theater geeks  will find this inside baseball approach quite as fascinating as linklater apparently does  i forgot that i was looking at an actor  i really believed i was looking at welles  working with the fact based eponymous novel by robert kaplow  first time screenwriters holly gent palmo and vince palmo are content to follow the contours of a standard behind the scenes story about the staging of a play  linklater keeps everything bouncing along  in sepia light and roar of the greasepaint dust  giving us a little lesson in theater history along with an appealing coming of age tale  
963,i_love_you_man,writer director john hamburg drastically misjudges audience sympathy here  because syd isn t cool at all  
964,paranormal_activity,it ll take quite some time to recover before you can sleep soundly without wondering if you re really alone in the room  not since david lynch s lost highway has a movie manipulated so skilfully the disturbing power of black screen space and the potential horror hidden within  
965,mid_august_lunch,it was easy to drink down and pleasure to eat up  and while it didn t blow my mind or rock my world it left me fully satiated to the point i hungered not a single ounce more  you d have trouble finding another movie with such unforced appreciation of its elderly characters or such intelligent understanding of old age

967,gran_torino,seeing the new inclusive clint shows an old dog can learn new tricks  but like walt himself  i can t help but prefer dirty harry to caring clint any day  it s a monumentally great film and keeps you spellbound till the lights come back up again  
968,1215792-amreeka,you ll end up baffled that a film built on such shaky foundations can end up being so impossibly sweet  does it occur to xenophobic americans that almost all immigrants  like their own ancestors  came here because they admire the united states  someone please explain that to lou dobbs  
969,disneynature_earth_2009,solid docu about global warming informs rather than preaches  i give directors alastair fothergill and mark linfield huge props for being able to so concisely whittle down their massive 11 episode magnum opus into such a delightfully entertaining and visually stimulating streamlined version  
970,1213684-big_fan,in his first starring role  oswalt  a stand up comedian whose trademark persona is part comic book geek and part frat house hedonist  inhabits a character who is both painfully familiar and poignantly alone  what s left is a vivid portrait of an exceedingly ordinary man for whom there s no great epiphany or cliched redemption  that may be siegel s trickiest play of all  superb noo yawk attitude  dialogue and performances keep the movie lively and tart  but it also turns out to have a surprising plot with a few twists you won t see coming  
971,la-danse----le-ballet-de-lopera-de-paris,this superb  utterly engrossing piece manages to dissect both an institution and an artform with extraordinary skill and beauty  it s not just boring  though  it s heart breaking  even hardcore fans of ballet might find themselves checking their e mails or nipping out for another bucket of popcorn  it is interesting up to a point  unfortunately it s a point that is reached long before the lengthy running time is even halfway over  don t be put off by the film s 153 minute running time   la danse is utterly engrossing and a must see for ballet and documentary enthusiasts alike  beautifully shot and compelling in parts but a love of classical dance helps  la danse is an example of cinema at its most musical  an awe inspiring celebration of body  mind and movement  a completely addictive  seemingly relaxed and formless ramble through weeks of rehearsal and performance footage  what s missing is a sense of who the dancers are as people and it makes la danse feel like it has missed some crucial steps  an observational documentary that captures within the frame the totality and truth of the moment  it is an insider s look at the ballet  but one that only an insider will get the most out of  a unique kind of magic  a documentary about the work in art that is itself a work of art  la danse  the paris opera ballet  frederick wiseman s astoundingly beautiful documentary  has sumptuous delights to satisfy every balletomane  captures the fleeting beauty of ballet in dozens of miniature portraits  each quietly soaring  this movie just goes up there and stays there  and it s magical  a rapturous  if occasionally disorienting  dance film precisely choreographed with seeming artlessness  
972,the_house_of_the_devil_2009,more concerned with stretching nail biting suspense to the breaking point than finding new ways of making heads explode  
973,bright_star,yes  it is a thing of beauty and  yes  things of beauty are joys for ever but we can also probably say this about them  they don t always add up to the most affecting movies  wonderful attention is paid to detail  including clothing  furniture and highly stylized behavior  what is missing is emotion  jane campion s film is as lyrical as you might expect but it s also enlivened with a bracing air of irreverence  campion takes her time to tell her tender story  but the film rewards with a conclusion i found incredibly moving  this is certainly one of the best films of the year  bright star is an admirable film made by a superb craftsman  but for me  campion fails to deliver the big emotional punch she hopes to land  a combination of unstuffy dialogue  wise casting  unselfconscious performances and sensuous but never pretty photography makes campion s version of the nineteenth century feel current but not anachronistic  without major tension  conflict or crisis  brawne and keats simply mope about  moon at each other  talk about literature and wait for the great poet to die from tuberculosis  dramatically static from first to final frame  it charts the non progress of the central relationship as a series of nineteenth century feints and counter feints  bright star is at once sublimely swoonsome yet marvellously down to earth  campion has created another resonant paean to love s pain and joy  and gives new life to john keats  too often now associated with dusty school books  despite being visually stunning  it s as dry as hell  in presenting keats as much in brawne s eyes as she in his  we watch fanny s growing interest in john  we wait with her for his letters  we share in her anguish when all seems lost    campion suggests that he was her  bright star  as well

975,michael_jackson_this_is_it,there are some who will claim this documentary is ghoulish  i think haunting is a better word  as you fathom what the music world would have been like had he lived  given just how much material kenny ortega and his editors plowed through to whittle together a two hour scrapbook and they still could only just barely come up with the presentable material here isn t exactly a vindication  
976,broken_embraces,though the film offers nothing new for the eyes  its wordiness ultimately acts as a complement rather than a drawback to almod var s masterful storytelling  while it may not be almod var s greatest work  it still stands well above most other films in terms of intrigue  intelligence and innovation  this melancholy romance is the first almodovar feature i ve ever really liked  an expertly fashioned melodrama that steers mercifully clear of his usual puckishness and star mongering  stylish and sly  an engaging exercise that gives us less than meets the eye  one failing in the film is how boring it is to watch cruz pretend to be a bad actress  the comic movie within a movie  which borrows from women on the verge  isn t funny  the filmmaker kept me continually off balance  my laughs having to find their way through a shower of tears all while the unyielding tension of the central mystery kept my insides twisting into tighter and tighter knots  as long as almodovar keeps investing such thought and energy in his work  he can play with whatever themes he desires  it s both ridiculous and ridiculously romantic  which is an apt description of a work shaped like a heart and structured like a pretzel  perhaps almodovar and film noir simply don t mix  when film makers start making films about film makers  you begin to worry that they ve run out of inspiration  broken embraces is a voluptuary of a film  drunk on primary colors  caressing penelope cruz  using the devices of a hitchcock to distract us with surfaces while the sinister uncoils beneath  
977,1200661-informant,soderbergh has commissioned a relentlessly jazzy  wacky musical score from hollywood veteran marvin hamlisch just so that we realise it s all supposed to be funny  scott z burns s script hinges entirely on incidents that take place off screen  the film will only work if audiences fail to notice this  but they won t  so it won t  after 1 1 2 hours of ker azee chuckles  you get one big clunker of a climax tossed in your lap  
978,pontypool,it s when our grasping for digestible concepts  clear causality  or anything resembling resolution is as thwarted as the characters  struggle to articulate or take action  that we re in the best position to absorb pontypool s full impact  alarmingly intelligent and deeply disorienting  pontypool plays as a radically different film upon subsequent viewings  its metaphor filled dialogue seeming to shift and alter in meaning with every scene  this low budget picture is a little too claustrophobic  and it grows tedious  the ominous  overbearing musical score tries but fails to jack up the tension  an original take on genre movies of its kind  an utterly baffling and stunningly boring zombie horror thriller  an immersive film built on inference and interrupted signals rather than cheap shock jock tactics  but the question remains  why the hell didn t they call it dead air  bruce mcdonald directs a tiptop cast  tony burgess  scripting from his own novel  clearly saw the grand guignol potential in the computer virus  in the way great plagues can be planted in tiny units of understanding  mchattie and houle are terrific as the besieged duo  with any luck  it will develop the cult it deserves because while its urgency makes it an easy target  pontypool s new ideas are commendably gripping  effective and spooky and definitely smarter than your average studio fare  pontypool is an off the wall little offering that rewards viewers looking for something different  
979,september_issue, cutler  worms his way into subcultures without judgment or probing  preferring to let group dynamics speak for themselves  
980,10010667-hangover,the hangover is funny but not deeply so  there s a difference between funny incidents piled up in a line and people who make us laugh because of who they are  this is an above par effort  excellently played and just naughty enough to be thought daring as well as amusingly spiteful  an intriguing  time hopping set up is wasted on obnoxious characters  celebrity cameos and crass attempts at humour  the lads duly lurch from one bewildering crisis to another  a furiously paced  inventive and flat out hilarious take on a tried and tested formula  an exemplary bromantic comedy that doesn t sacrifice heart in pursuit of laughs  maintaining plenty of the former and a superabundance of the latter  some very funny  very non pc dialogue is thrown about like a game of catch  the actors  virtually unknown  are terrific  a wee inducingly funny bromance  unlike last years rather uninspiring what happens in vegas  the hysterical the hangover actually ends up doing sin city proud   the hangover  pretty much demands you leave your political correctness cap at home and urges you to eschew your thinking cap as well  when the years have passed and the buzz has worn off  i honestly feel that people will look back at the hangover and wonder what they laughed at in 2009  it s the zima of movie comedies  
981,soul_power,a non stop head bobbing knee bouncer  gluttons for these artists and for music festivals in general might wonder  as i have  whether there s any way the filmmakers might share more of the remaining 123 1 2 hours  passionate fans of the music will relish these archived images while regular moviegoers will be entertained  but not moved by what they see  
982,10011284-skin,sophie okonedo beautifully portrays laing as a confused and scared young woman who s forced to choose a color line  but not without her share of heartache and pain  while it s important we never forget the horrendous evils of humanities past  skin is sadly one social studies class too many  potent  still relevant and inspiring while maddening  skin shows some of our best and much of our worst  every emotion is underscored with sugary music  every narrative plot progression telegraphed with the mechanical structural stiffness of a made for tv movie  great performances and a smart decision to avoid melodrama make skin worth seeing but it s the small things that hold it back from being truly great  this great film by anthony fabian tells this story through the eyes of a happy girl who grows into an outsider  skin is a moving and smartly made account of a truly peculiar episode from the period of apartheid that existed as national policy in south africa until just 15 years ago  this unadorned but affecting drama about sandra laing  who attracted media attention in the 1950s when her white parents fought the south african system  suffers from a one note script  but still does right by its tricky subject  the direction is never more than conventional  with a tear inducing finale better suited to a tv soap opera  in a day when it s difficult to say something new about the racial divide  sandy s story has a poignant power as it underscores just how deeply the fissures run even when it s all in the family  we don t need overwrought performances to understand the calamity of her life or to weep when her parents turn their backs on her  if anything  the story demands restraint because  invariably at the movies  it s the gentle touch that hits harder  
983,bandslam,the characterisations are just a little unorthodox and the whole thing  despite a soggy middle during which nothing much happens  goes with an above average swing  bandslam consistently exceeds current teen flick standards thanks to its snarky humour  its strong musical sequences and its ability to convey the excitement the characters feel both about performing and forming new friendships  the bonus in this modest charmer  not a single major female character  including will s single mother played by lisa kudrow  is subjected to the usual hollywood rom com demonization  
984,julie_and_julia, amy adams   half of the film plays like a below par rom com  so here s the question  is the good half good enough  probably  yes  but then i would watch meryl rearranging a closet  it s just the way i am  julie   julia was pure entertainment  the title of this film should be amended to julie  julia    nora  nora ephron s script and direction  along with the performances of meryl streep and amy adams  add up to one joyous picture  julie   julia is a delectable cinematic concoction about two food loving women  what makes this film memorable and pleasurable  above all  is the ebullient performance of meryl streep as julia child  unlikely culinary trailblazer and tv star  as food movies go    and they ve become a genre of their own    this one may be a little too rich but it s full of delights  deliciously funny and warming fare  for which the amazing meryl deserves her ridiculously overdue third oscar  a film that s charming  funny   especially when streep is on screen  broadcasting her superb impression of the tall  charismatic  high pitched child   but leaves you with a dissatisfaction with modern life that no culinary masterpiece can relieve  julie   julia is a highly polished piece of upmarket entertainment  brimming with beautiful interiors  if you throw in the lavish helpings of food porn it s almost like a colour supplement come to life  a dose of stodgy comfort food in the form of a complacent  mediocre film  with an exasperatingly flaccid and anti climactic ending  it s refreshing to see male performers being towered over by female leads  it s even more refreshing to watch a film that exults in the pleasures of uxoriousness  julie   julia seems satisfied to fall short of its potential   whether as an insightful romantic comedy or an exploration of food lust   relying on streep to carry the film with her witty turn as child  like being force fed a dish of candied pecans  smothered in honey  washed down with a bottle of eiswein  by the end of it you re screaming for a tumbler of vinegar cut with lemon juice and a nice sprinkling of asafoetida  
985,black_dynamite,it falls into the category of what typically has become known as  blaxploitation  films  but gave such films of the similar genre  for instance coffy  a bad name  a brilliant laugh out loud slapstick crowd pleaser made with love and talent  fond and very funny homage to the exploitation era  the portentous dialogue  two track recorded soundtrack  by adrian younge  and eager performances are all highly diverting  a pin sharp send up of 1970s blaxploitation  black dynamite will stir some pleasant memories  but even with that being the case i did enjoy myself while watching it  the good outweighing the bad just enough i m willing to cut this ghetto kung fu crime fighter some slack  an enjoyable celebratory ode to a fiercely entertaining counterculture inspired genre  as a five minute clip on youtube  this spoof might be a small masterpiece  as a feature film  it s both too much and not nearly enough  a cheerfully affectionate if fit fully amusing spoof of  70s blaxpoitation movies  scott sanders  black dynamite painstakingly nails the cheesy look  music and martial arts moves of the originals  if there s a night at the movies more fun than this deadpan blaxploitation flick  it s probably boosted by something bought in a dark alley  
986,invictus,what strikes you most about this film is just how much pleasure a sure footed  confident director can deliver by keeping everything simple  invictus is eastwood in full stanley kramer richard attenborough mode  playing down to the americans who love cheesy triumphant sports movies but who generally know little about south africa and care even less  a monolithic sporting saga that seems content to pose on the podium  lulled by the belief that its subject matter provides inspiration enough  invictus is undone by its own overindulgence  turning a unifying moment of celebration and clarity into an underwhelming piece of cinematic clich  it s still a great film though   expertly mixing a political biopic and an underdog sports movie together  which under a less sure hand could have turned out like the mighty ducks coached by george w  you re likely to leave invictus with a few nagging questions perhaps the greatest testament to eastwood s directorial skill is that such an unattractive  brutish game could serve as an uplifting symbol of communal harmony and renewed national spirit  
987,1213732-no_impact_man,how much can we possibly glean from a guy whose idealism can be measured with a calendar  an enviro doc that doesn t soft pedal the fact that the calculated  consciousness raising media event it chronicles is a conceptual stunt  no impact man manages to present its new york do gooder couple as both likably idealistic and inevitably conf 
988,10011949-collapse,if he s even half right  the world our children and grandchildren will inherit doesn t bear thinking about  smith treats ruppert both as exhibit and patient  and he comes across as an angry yet compassionate man  secure in his convictions but lost in his emotions  intelligently probed by director chris smith and always compelling to watch  the chain smoking ruppert s vision of the future should be on everyone s viewing list  rich on rhetoric  if sometimes a little loopy in the ideas beneath  his theories start to live up to the title of the film but he does raise some interesting points of discussion that aren t a part of the international discussion nearly as much as they should be  ruppert unexpectedly breaks down  weeping openly for the lost future of humanity  and at that moment i was startled at how bad i felt for him    and how nervous i was  suddenly  that this contemporary cassandra might just be right  it s only when he starts to weep for the future of a population that won t heed his warnings that ruppert shows his humanity  it s made him abandon his cause and quit writing  collapse  is a grueling peek at a doomsday prophet s rigorous mind but in a sly way also a compassionate look at the strain ruppert endures from knowing he has only ever been right  it would have been helpful had smith put his words into some sort of context  allowing others to assess his theories  instead there s simply ruppert  talking  raging and warning  as if his very life depended on it  collapse is boring  but what do you expect from a one sided movie about a kook  who  at the time the film was shot  faced eviction from his home because he hadn t paid the rent  
989,10011304-thirst,red blood and black humour spurt hard as thirst reveals itself to be one of the most deliciously skewed incisions into the vampire romance subgenre  park aficionados are assured their fix of lurid imagery and baroque plotting  though straight up horror buffs may get restless during the sluggish and murky middle section  twilight fans need not apply  
990,humpday,one could only feel sorry for alycia delmore as the pliant wife of the silly husband  who goes along with his irritatingly neurotic friend s idea  if i wanted to hear would be counter culture yuppies yell at each other i d hang out with my own loser friends  
991,10010675-departures,the movie gestures towards deep emotions  but an abiding soft grained superficiality effectively insulates us from the piercing realities of grief  it breaks no new ground  offers no audacious insights or rude revelations  toe follows tac as surely as tac follows tic  
992,1217389-we_live_in_public,timoner s laudable impulse to chronicle recent history is wasted on insipid overstuffed montages and redundant testimonials  skirting real engagement with the culture in favor of cover story hooks  josh harris focuses the lens on himself  you probably have never heard of him  and when the film is over  you may wish you still hadn t  the big question is whether we re now living in a more pragmatic time   timoner s  film   cobbled together over 15 years   has grown so beguiled by its wonky  disquieting hero that it has lost its distance and mislaid all scepticism  what timoner has done for sure is assemble another documentary of monumental scope  she has a priceless knack for being in the right place at the right time  allied to a filmmaker s instinct for narrative  and a journalistic tenacity  another bizarre  bewitching tale from those that make up life in  on and around the worldwide web  we live in public is the kind of nonfiction film that seems to have been conceived to prove that truth is stranger than almost any fiction    this is a remarkable film about a strange and prophetic man  what does it tell us  did living a virtual life destroy him  harris  who appears throughout in interview footage  is an interesting mix    someone with a serious inability to connect with other people and yet at the same time someone with a consistent ability to see the future  like timoner s dig   this astounding new docu burrows into the thin and darkly funny spaces between artistry and vanity  isolation and community  collaboration and exploitation  sanity and madness  there must be a reason why  after all these year  timoner chose to make a movie about harris  if you figure it out  please let me know  a snapshot of several new york eras that coincide with the internet s growing pains  we live in public looks at one man s experiments with issues of privacy  
993,a_town_called_panic,the frenetic scenarios should play fairly well as energizing for kids and ridiculous for adults  a heady and utterly unapologetic roller coaster ride into a hyper vivid  hyperactive world created from cheap children s toys  directors stphane aubier and vincent patar  who also provide voices  display a pleasantly warped sensibility without going for adult humor  all the silliness unfolds in a complex social structure  where good manners are expected  bad behaviour is punished and birthdays are not to be forgotten  
994,it_might_get_loud,the mood s too good spirited  and in that there are great pleasures   not least the sound of mind thinking of three rockers putting paid to the tired clich of burbling rock gods trapped in their own shadows  the film might have benefited from a trim and a more linear approach  but mostly it fulfils its role as an illuminating homage to both the protagonists involved and  above all  the guitar as popular music s most timeless icon  a bizarre follow up to the fifth biggest cinema documentary of all time  and one that s as testing on the patience as a 10 minute guitar solo with extra tremolo  by delving into their backgrounds and character quirks  guggenheim aims the film beyond the interests of purists  academics  fans and musicians to provide an adventure film exploring the heart of creativity  guitar heroes  real or imaginary  will think they ve died and gone to heaven  the trouble is  once you get past the historical information and chummy interviews  you have to put up with the inevitable risk of any ad hoc jam session  it might get boring  davis guggenheim s contrived documentary is a largely unrewarding essay on the mystique of the ubiquitous electric guitar    rock fans and guitar heroes in the making will get a charge out of visiting where the happy accidents that put guitars into each man s hand happened  and the playing isn t bad  either  loud  but good  for guitar geeks  the sight of page  edge and white together in one room will be enough  others  however  can t help but wish it might have gotten a little louder  it does make you want to pull out some old records and listen with a new appreciation for certain sounds you once might have taken for granted  the film s very title is a tease  however  it never gets all that loud  and you might doze off after 30 minutes of watching this unwieldy power trio  
995,where_the_wild_things_are,it is bewildering but not in an emotionally complex or troublesome way  it s bewildering in a narratively confused  narratively lost  we never figured out what we wanted all this extra stuff to add up to sort of way  the minus i give this children s story pains me   if i had seen this film when i was eight  i would have been terrified  distorts sendak s core emotional truths via rough  n  tumble jackass jr  spectacle  a film for anyone who s ever climbed trees  grazed knees or basked in the comfort of a parent s sympathy as they ve pulled you off the ground crying  it ll make your inner child run wild  jonze s wild things is an altogether darker  colder picture  a film about the way children can lose their fear of the world only by losing their innocence  loud  narcotised  emotionally stunted  it s so eager to avoid the horrors of mainstream commodity culture that it concocts a defensive version of pre adulthood  i have no idea what jonze and eggers are trying to say here  either to children or to adults  but it s difficult to imagine how they could have made a more tedious and exasperating attempt at it  what would have been perfection at one hour is still a bravely different christmas movie  one destined to be a cult classic for generations to come  imagination is the real star of sendak s classic and jonze and his co writer  dave eggers  have expanded on its brief text to spin a story in which the tough and the tender smoothly coalesce  young actor max records gives a terrific performance that captures both the uncertainty and the rampaging energy of his character  by the time it was over i was deeply unsatisfied  and while i did see glimmers of my own childhood here and there i didn t see enough for the movie to win me over  
996,the_road_2009,i cannot say how faithful this is but  having read other mccarthy books  would say the novel probably repaid your attention with its astonishing prose  this  though  puts you through the wringer  but doesn t repay you in any way  even with the brief cameos by robert duvall and guy pearce  the road doesn t meet expectations  a remarkable  haunting picture worth multiple viewings  anyone looking for either an adventure or an engrossing rumination on life after the end will find it tough to see beyond the film s starkly rendered gloom  a trojan horse blockbuster that promises the wham bam of apocalypse while actually delivering the quiet pain of human intimacy  the road might just be one of the most heartfelt end of the world movies yet made  this one note exercise in neo medieval moodiness eventually dissolves into that perennial and most corny of hollywood tropes  the search for redemption  a disappointment  we come out humming the film s acting and production design  while wishing we could stop humming nick cave s music  which pulls out all the stops marked  miserere mei  popcorn version    an unforgettable love story  an absorbing road movie  a searing examination of people pushed to the very limits and an ultimately uplifting celebration of the human spirit  like mad max on mogadon  the film is enraptured with its own depressiveness  coming on like the worst new year hangover you ve ever had  it s almost but not quite as good as the 2006 classic post disaster film children of men   and that s good enough for me  
997,police_adjective,certainly there s little here to detain michael bay fans  but anyone who appreciates bone dry deadpan humour and intelligently subversive film making will find plenty to raise their interest   if not their adrenaline level  it s one of those films which  on its placid but pointed surface  seems to be about nothing very much but manages by its end to tell us a great deal  complex  intellectually rigorous and yet incredibly enjoyable on multiple levels  a riveting slice of romanian new wave drama  haunted by shadows of the ceausescu era and never less than thought provoking  necessarily infuriating but finally very rewarding  it s unlike anything hollywood would dare to make  porumboiu s style is steady  observational  his camera tracking cristi along the streets in much the way cristi tracks his subject  the movie could have easily been called concept  belabored  i suspect that those versed in the arcana of romanian politics will get the most out of this movie  but its moral issues  revolving as they do around matters of rightness and repression  are certainly universal  
998,young_victoria,this may be the perfect shared entertainment for daughters just growing out of their princess phase and mothers with their own challenges balancing love and work  the way this story is told is just basically by people reading letters in voiceover while you look at beautiful furniture  you don t have to be a royalist to be moved by beautifully staged coronation and wedding moments  and composer ilan eshkeri scores such scenes with music so thrilling you ll feel you ve got a front row seat to the real thing  a lovingly detailed  lavishly recreated british period production with all the right cast giving all the right performances  
999,1212111-triangle,the film only makes some kind of sense on its own fantastic level  the whole film is smart cinema  i wouldn t be surprised if smith didn t land up with a contract in hollywood  a satisfying mind twister  with an unexpectedly poignant pay off  you ll see where it s going quite early on  but it still keeps some shocks back for the final act  melissa george s fearless  credible performance grounds the madness in a moving emotional reality  even as her sanity is lost at sea  a rather smart  interestingly constructed scary movie from british director christopher smith  this seaborne psycho thriller has an unusual creepiness about it  
1000,toy_story_3,the ostensibly inanimate objects are far more animated than most movie stars  it takes a kind of genius to combine a children s movie for grown ups and a grown up s movie for children in one glittering digimated package  yet the folks at pixar have done it time and again  when teenaged andy plops down on the grass to share his old toys with a shy little girl  the film spikes with sadness and layered pleasure    a concise  deeply wise expression of the ephemeral that feels real and yet utterly transporting  there are many sweet laughs and joking allusions to horror and prison break movies  but the pixar gang gets at the most primary fear    being cast off and no longer of use  i seriously doubt there will be a more hilarious and heartfelt blockbuster all summer  you can intellectualise and even defend the reasons why the film is disappointing  but that doesn t stop it being disappointing  it s still more inventive  clever and laugh out loud funny than any other movie out there now  comes across at once as a tender  thoughtful valedictory and a symbolic renewal  i tried stuffing paper into my nose and into my mouth and in my ears to stop the flow  it was hopeless  toy story 3 is not only a masterpiece but is the most heart rending film i have ever seen  it s an effortlessly superior family movie  if there were a nobel prize for digital animation it would have been won almost every year by pixar  
1001,the-social-network,business hasn t been this exciting since gordon gekko s first outing  
1002,how_to_train_your_dragon,based on the book by cressida cowell  the movie from writer director dean dubois is funny  well drawn and imaginatively structured so that adults need have no fear about taking the kids to it  three cheers to dreamworks for zipping it  at long last  in laying aside the post modern quips  they ve rediscovered an airborne sense of joy  what we have here is an exhilarating epic that mixes comedic and touching moments with some of the best action sequences ever created with cgi animation  toothless has the one precious ingredient that s missing from so many of hollywood s contemporary animated characters  an air of mystery  smartly dispensing with the usual hubbub of pop references that dot many of these films  the movie offers touching  quiet moments and imaginative  high flying beauty  it s fantastically entertaining  it s a harry potter meets avatar adventure that should delight most children and adults  swooping visuals and knockabout comedy blend in a family entertainment that should be the easter weekend treat  technically proficient and featuring a witty  intelligent  surprisingly insightful script  how to train your dragon comes close to the level of pixar s recent output while easily exceeding the juvenilia dreamworks has released in the last nine years  how to train your dragon is a fun filled frolic through the skies as seen through the eyes of a kid both young and old will be able to relate to  its ultimate destinations ones many viewers will thrill to again and again and again  a sweet david vs goliath tale that has the heart that most animated films don t bother to attempt to find  
1003,true_grit_2010,delivers a perfectly fine  character driven revenge yarn before unaccountably falling into a heap in its final act  
1004,the_kings_speech,travel without prejudice and you will enjoy a moving  impeccably acted and surprisingly funny slice of comfort food  there are worse ways of starting an unpromising looking year  
1005,inside_job_2010,a sharp study of corporate greed for those who felt michael moore pulled too many punches  this scathing expose should be enough to alarm people all over the political spectrum  large portions of it had me twisting and turning in my seat to such a degree i m sure it would have been distracting had someone been sitting behind me  a lot of what ferguson documents so damning and ill inducing they re difficult to describe  
1006,waste-land,the glimpses of favela life will make you thank your lucky stars you weren t born there  
1007,last_train_home-2009,it is a sometimes shocking  oftentimes heartbreaking look at what it takes to raise children in a culture where grueling factory work can take parents away from their young for months at a time  this small masterpiece of documentary filmmaking offers a human scale look at the impact of china s industrial growth  lixin fan  handling his own cinematography  shoots with such a painterly eye that he almost undermines the social critique he s making  what else do you want  the question echoes down every frame of this haunting film  and fan doesn t pretend to have an answer  it s depressing enough to watch this family s struggles with life  but their pain really hits home when you think that the pants you might be wearing could have contributed to it  an expert  unobtrusive observer  fan disappears inside his own film and allows us to get completely inside his subjects  lives  fan s camera moves sinuously through these people s lives and gives a human face to a national panorama  this is essential viewing for understanding our world  lixin plays up the atmospheric underclass misery in service of a beautifully shot  heartbreaking vrit narrative about generation gaps and culture clashes  doing double duty as the film s cinematographer  fan demonstrates a pitch perfect photojournalistic eye  
1008,1213205-prophet,usually  i don t much like films in which males throw violence at any problem that comes their way    but this is such an intensely mature piece of work featuring such intensely mature performances that i was too involved to let it bother me  audiard never overplays the new experiences facing malik  be they violent or touching  yet his tender regard for our complicated hero shines through  tremendously watchable cinema  
1009,127_hours,any film that relies on one actor to carry the movie demands a lot of its leading man but james franco applies a youthful exuberance that makes him so watchable it s all viewers could do not to blink  franco    delivers a solid performance as the strapping climber who shows his vulnerability when he reflects back on his life  the mistakes he s made and the moments he may miss  it s an incredible performance by franco  walking the line between what once was enthusiasm but now is manic desperation  that director danny boyle makes us feel the shock of relief as ralston finally pulls away from his stony prison signals just how immersive a piece of first person story telling this is  at the end  we stagger like ralston from the dark into the light  we might have both our arms left  but our nerves are just as terrorised  danny boyle can t help but return  over and over again  to material that s heavy on physical pain  mental paranoia and personal treachery  in taking a movie of the week plotline and giving it a technical supercharge  boyle has restated his case among the front rank of filmmakers  franco acts his heart and soul out  as ryan reynolds did in buried  a similar one man agony opera in a confined space  a film that no sane movie exec would ever commission  fortunately for us  though  there are no sane movie execs  a surprisingly fun  effervescent against the odds drama that offers an upbeat moral without the usual punishing survival story clichs  not for the faint hearted  mind  boyle has always been an exceptionally stylish director  and  despite its limited setting  127 hours is a marvel of visual eye candy  directed and co written by danny boyle in a style that travels from ecstatic to nerve wracking and back  this is a film about perseverance  strength and the importance of always letting people know where you re going  fair warning  oh squeamish ones  127 hours does not shy away from  nor does it stint on  ralston s ultimate method of obtaining egress from his predicament  which is exactly as it should be  
1010,marwencol,may be aesthetically rough around the edges but it nonetheless offers an empathetic view on a stunningly unique figure  an astounding movie one of those tales of all american oddness that just keeps flowering into weirder  richer territory  
1011,the_town,affleck s overall directorial instincts are sound  breathtaking car chases and ear rattling shoot outs are thrillingly executed  
1012,restrepo,its most emotionally raw moments are indicative of their military subjects  exceptional comfort level with their observers         the arid yet woody outcroppings high above the valley are an intriguing new terrain restrepo avoids political discussion  it just revels in the heroism of these impossibly young  brave soldiers who follow orders that at times seem pointless because following them is what their country has asked them to do  captures the complex human face of modern warfare  film doesn t get more relevant  powerful  terrifying and soulful  this real life hurt locker is an intimate  often brilliant insight into combat and comradeship  the camera lingers on the soldiers  smiles and tears and shows the human face of military tactics which reduce people to chess pieces  at this point in all our middle eastern conflicts  we need more from a documentary than just a grunts eye view of the frustrating nature of the war  by keeping the focus solely upon the outpost and the soldiers who lived and fought there  the co directors effectively seal the film off from any external influence  though hetherington and junger s film doesn t ultimately have anything new to say about the nature of war  it will nonetheless have a strong impact on those of us fortunate enough to have experienced combat only in its motion picture form  try as it might to keep its distance from opinion and focus on the facts  restrepo can t help leaving you with a sense of despair about the situation in afghanistan  hetherington and junger s fair minded chronicling of military experience remains a valuable piece of filmmaking  perhaps essential in reminding us of what warfare extracts from those who fight it  a riveting  you are there  deployment to a godforsaken place where united states troops are pinned down by enemy fire almost every day

1019,gasland,gasland will no doubt spark the political debate it intends  cheney  the great outdoorsman  nearly killed a friend while hunting  that was nothing  however  compared with what he s been doing to thousands of his fellow countrymen  with a remorselessness all the more powerful for its quiet unfussiness  fox builds up a riveting portrait of near apocalyptic environmental damage and a corporate mindset willing to ruin water sources irrevocably for the sake of a few years  profit  gasland may be the first ever american film in which nixon is the hero  it is the 101st in which dick cheney is the villain  while the hushed tones of fox s would be na f commentary slightly grate after a while  his film s images  contrasting natural beauty with industrial horror show  are bracingly effective indeed  this very good documentary by noted american troublemaker josh fox details the contamination of drinking water caused by the drilling for natural gas and explores the callous corporate mentality behind it  an exhaustive and eye opening look at natural gas drilling and its potential dangers  there s an acerbically straightforward  old fashioned muckrake gurgling with righteous pugnacity beneath the mannered surface of josh fox s gasland  with its jolting images of flammable tap water and chemically burned pets  new york theater director turned documentarian josh fox s sundance feted shocker makes an irrefutable case against u s  corporate  fracking   it s not pretty  but it works for some  gasland won a special jury prize at the 2010 sundance film festival  
1020,ajami,what comes through is that the troubles besetting muslims and jews and their emotional responses are similar in nature  the people involved have so much in common  its sense of ambiance  most apparent during scenes of simple conversation between characters  more than compensates for the cinematic overdetermination  a rare film that will force you to confront your own prejudices  this is vividly challenging  utterly inclusive and heartfelt cinema  it s not only gripping to watch  but it ll open your eyes to the intractable human conundrums behind the blood stained headlines  by showing how people fail to live together   in a film you could call israel s city of god  with its sectarian feuding story lent power and immediacy by improvisation and non professional casting   ajami shows how they might or should live together  the fact that these two israelis from opposite camps worked together to make this movie is as important as the movie itself  it does place the audience squarely amid the myriad horrors of a land and a conflict predicated  it appears  on little more than an age old blood feud and joseph heller s concept of catch 22  a compelling drama about prejudice and folly  it s an admirably even handed portrait of life in an occupied ghetto that is bounded by checkpoints  everyone we meet is a more or less honorably motivated victim of circumstance  it s a film that rewards close attention  involving disparate characters whose lives intersect over the course of several chapters  ajami brings its audience into a world where the cultural conflict is fierce  emotions run high  yet the hopeful vision of peaceful coexistence shines through the cracks  it has a complex  elliptical structure that uses unconventional filming techniques to tell a bleak and fatalistic story conveyed with an unnerving sense of verisimilitude  while its themes of revenge  mutual resentment and grim fatalism offer little hope for a ready solutions  the movie itself testifies to the power of creative collaboration in finding common ground  ajami keeps asking  when do people cross the line  and when does pulling the trigger become a viable option  shani and copti  who costars as a hipster druggie  elicit moving performances from their nonprofessional actors  who ground the somewhat breathless action in a streetwise realism  
1021,film_unfinished,filmmaker yael hersonski reshapes the impossibly vile and tragic source material into a devastating record of nazi criminality  discovered after the war  the film contains horrific images of starvation  poverty and humiliation  interspersed with surreal scenes of well dressed jews enjoying a restaurant dinner or an urban stroll  what we are left with is perhaps one of the most disturbing 60 minutes of raw footage ever put together  hersonski not only dispels the big lie at the center of the nazi footage but she ingeniously separates and identifies the many smaller lies and where they entwined with facts

1023,the_fighter_2011,both wahlberg and bale are excellent in their different registers  as are melissa leo and amy adams as the differently calibrated women  the fighter looks at first as if it is going to be a far more interesting movie than the straightforward and even rather undemanding drama we finally get  russell throws so much at the screen that there is little time to make your mind up   a  rickety  unfocused contraption of a film that sputters and chugs along without offering any hint of why its director thought it was worth making  the film bounces us from one pugilistic or domestic affray to the next  only coming to a near standstill whenever wahlberg gets acting space  it goes to show  two very different but equally powerful performances combine to deliver an exhilarating fight flick that  like its scrappy central character  is impossible not to root for  though director david o russell does embrace the feel good cliches embedded into movie folklore by rocky  he does so with a rousing conviction that pushes all the right buttons  ward s story may unfold in the manner of many sports biopics but the fighter s more about the complex familial ties that bind than it is about the sweet science itself  i suspect that over time the fighter will accrue a cult following among boxing aficionados as a rare film that got the sport they love right  while the boxing is phenomenal  breathlessly staged to the point there were times i could swear i felt mickey s devastating left hook slam into my jaw  it is the twisted and complex family drama that makes this film such an astonishing piece of work  makes too many concessions to the hollywood judges  pulls too many punches  the fighter is so muscularly and tenderly good because it trains its eye on the matches that take place between kin  as albert einstein said when he scribbled e mc2 on the back of a princeton bar napkin   sometimes formulas work   
1024,no_one_knows_about_persian_cats,shot on location  filled with real people portraying themselves  ghobadi takes risks other filmmakers would run screaming from  his film oozing with a validity it never would have achieved otherwise  
1025,tangled,this snappy role reversal may or may not appeal to young men  but it inspires some classic knockabout screwball comedy and an exciting  vertiginous escape sequence  i can t help liking a movie with chameleon reaction shots  
1026,boxing_gym,don t go to boxing gym expecting pugilistic melodrama about long shot underdogs  there s not an ounce of fat or clich in frederick wiseman s new documentary  frederick wiseman must drive certain nonfiction filmmakers crazy  he makes it look too easy  there s no disputing the cumulative authority of wiseman s ongoing human comedy or ignoring the influence that his epic observational style has had on fiction filmmakers

1029,fish_tank,it s not wholly convincing and its view of tower block dwellers may well be patronising  but it is utterly absorbing and has such impact that you seriously have to gather yourself afterwards   andrea  arnold has a knack for subtle details but also for portraying female characters whose natural warmth and energy have been muted by trauma or social isolation  a bold new entry in the long standing british tradition of disquieting social realism  writer director andrea arnold has created something so real and raw  you may come away with a twinge of guilty voyeurism  a sense of peering too closely and impolitely into other people s lives  andrea arnold is too skilled not to surprise you with the unexpectedly graceful moment  and she has a feel for the downtrodden milieu she loves exploring  in the film s dark final third  it s as if we ve entered a waking nightmare  with stop and start rhythms as mia takes one wrong step after another  fish tank  which won the 2009 jury prize in cannes  has moments when mia s tribulations really hit home  in a year less crowded with new young talent  katie jarvis might now be getting fittings for her oscar nomination dress  watching fish tank is  as the title implies  like gazing through the glass of an aquarium at the lives of those trapped within  whose only chance of escape would seem to be through death and the indignity of being flushed down a toilet  unfolds as a conventional coming of age story  yet andrea arnold hasn t altered her persuasively jaundiced view of men  who seem as pitifully helpless against their horndog urges as the women foolish enough to care for them  
1030,the_tillman_story,bar lev s documentary s greatest service isn t in recounting the army s back pedaling so much as underscoring how communal needs and family grief don t perfectly align  and that political usefulness may attempt to trump all other rites  could you imagine how difficult it must have been to pore over records containing the brutal facts of your son s death  
1031,black_swan_2010,director darren aronofsky s darkly enthralling entertainment makes the perfect antidote to too many sugary holiday nutcrackers  audiences won t know who to trust and what is real in this terrifyingly great film that will grab hold of you until the final act  for all his command of adrenalized  propulsive narrative and his dazzling technical facility  aronofsky s study in female hysteria ultimately favors frenzy over compassion or insight and remains strictly skin deep  portman hasn t been this good since her early performances in the professional and heat  and is deservedly attracting intense oscar buzz  kunis brings to lily a savvy sexiness  and cassel is entertainingly smarmy  full of sex  drugs  catfights  violence  hallucinations and even some choice girl on girl action  what more could you possibly want from a ballet movie  an extraordinary  intoxicating movie  its hard  twisted edges may turn off some  but there s no faulting either aronofsky s technical mastery or portman s flawless performance  a bona fide  trumpet it from the chimney pots masterpiece that also happens to be a terrific psychological thriller and features meg from family guy copping off with queen amidala  practice makes perfectly insane in black swan  a tale of one ballerina s psychosexual freakout  aronofsky lets us thrill in the in the act of creation without ever letting us forget the terrible sacrifices many artists make to entertain us  portman  saddled with the near impossible role of an impenetrable heroine we must care for without ever coming close to understanding  delivers career high work here    easily one of the most emotionally impactful films of the year and is something that will certainly haunt you long after the credits roll in the best possible way  
1032,10011295-samson_and_delilah,how do you know you re looking at a pretty good piece of filmmaking  when the director and actors can make you care about the central characters even though they exchange almost no dialogue  
1033,joan-rivers-a-piece-of-work,an entirely sympathetic portrait of the artist at an advancing age  but it all happened  the truths of the film so indisputably poignant i m aghast at just how much they moved and intoxicated me  
1034,carlos_2010,carlos deserves mention alongside the greatest suspense thrillers ever made  a terrifying portrait of an egomaniac who demands absolute obedience  and craves it even more when his power and relevance are drained away  it s a subtle  ultimately staggering portrayal of a bloody minded ideologue who convinced only himself  goes on for longer than a kidney transplant op  there are ups and downs to international terrorism as a career and carlos lays them out very fairly  carlos is a television drama turned movie that interestingly injects a boxset quality into its idea of epic  an imaginative but exhausting study of a man who embodied the shifting sands of history  ramirez s outstanding performance and assayes  superb skill in storytelling make this a mini series not to be missed  assayas returns with a hulking  seething  intermittently sublime  five and a half hour film in which he manages to draw together elements from both of these distinct styles  a wizardly piece of brutal  romantic filmmaking  it makes old fashioned beret based terrorism look a thrill  why turn a movie into a marathon  because time may be fleeting  but it s mysteriously elastic as well  once you ve committed to an experience as intense as this one  hours become much less than the sum total of their minutes  carlos is exciting entertainment  even if its subject s two decade reign of terror is reprehensible  
1035,dogtooth,the true dark horse nominee among this year s foreign language oscar contenders  dogtooth leaves bite marks that stick around long after you are released from its grip  few movies convey such a deeply unnerving atmosphere in nearly every scene while simultaneously capitalizing on an absurd black comic sensibility

1038,lourdes_2010,spiritually flawed and often cynical though hausner s pilgrims undoubtedly are  they re all too recognisably human  adventurous filmgoers will be rewarded by its unusually open ended storyline  
1039,waiting_for_superman,it s possible that one of the reasons why the film wasn t nominated for a best documentary oscar was because it was too horrifying  in the end  this is scattergun film making  well intentioned but sloppy  sometimes deliberately evasive  if this documentary were an exam essay  i d fail it  you know you re in an endangered superpower when a vice president who spells  potatos  without an  e  is followed two decades later by a president for whom the plural of child is  childrens   your heart goes out to all these kids  but guggenheim s take on education stacks the deck against them even further by implying that only charters offer a ray of hope  would that it were that simple  an admirable exercise in straight talk  especially in its tough assessment of the mediocrity enforcing teachers  unions  we need another movie  one that shows us why some charter schools work and others dont  guggenheim shows us that there is light at the end of this tunnel  we just have to be willing to do the hard work necessary to make sure those bulbs start burning brightly and that the flickering signaling their end comes to a stop  you leave the film convinced that radical change is necessary but uncomfortable with the closing voice over that assures you how simple it will be to implement it  there is no question that this is compelling viewing  especially considering the largely abstract and policy driven nature of the crisis  the photography and editing are accomplished  and the filmmaker frequently resorts to animation and other tricks to make his subject more palatable  it s meant to infuriate you and break your heart enough that you feel compelled to do something  there s a great deal of agit with very little prop  
1040,rabbit_hole,doing grief is tricky  at its most effective  it can reach out and wrap itself around your heart  but  nicole  kidman is never given a chance to take it in  deep into herself  and bring it out  it s not an easy ride but  as far as difficult rides go  this is worth taking and holding on for dear life  rabbit hole is a searing drama that  despite its bleak theme  bravely posits how even the deepest emotional abyss need not become a prison of depression and hopelessness  the script  adapted by playwright david lindsay abaire from his own pulitzer prize winner  demonstrates an extreme  occasionally comic  distaste for the sentimentality often provoked by other people s grief  the sheer excruciating  stultifying good taste of this movie is almost unbearable   so tasteful it could have started out as a coffee table book  though actually it is based on a pulitzer winning play by david lindsay abaire  kidman  looking almost anorexic with grief and sharply critical of everyone trying to comfort her  including her husband  is as good as she has been for some time  if you must watch the portrait of a marriage strained to breaking point  try the recent blue valentine  where you at least feel sorry for the unhappy couple that once cherished and loved each other  will stay with you for days  a moving and truly beautiful film  the terrain of grief is well mapped out in american art movies  but rabbit hole finds some subtle new pathways through it  everyone monologues  philosophises  weeps or does stream of consciousness cadenzas  no one has a human quirk or foible  the problem with  rabbit hole  is that it plays at one unrelentingly gloomy frequency  occasional moments of humour or tension are simply unable to puncture the overriding sense of oppressive sadness  plays out with all the subtlety of one of those bum awful  issues driven  episodes of eastenders  you half expect an  if you were affected by the events in this movie  you can call our special helpline  message to drone out over the end credits  for all its sympathy and intelligence  rabbit hole is ultimately too safe an experience for such a free form tragedy  rabbit hole  directed with grace and surprising humor by john cameron mitchell  is a delicate tale that shares a great deal of the hurt of robert redford s ordinary people  as heavy  stressful  relentlessly sad dramas go  this one goes quite well  john cameron mitchell directed  making an impressive detour in style and subject matter after his flamboyant shortbus and hedwig and the angry inch  
1041,secret_in_their_eyes,the film rattles along like a well crafted hollywood noir  circa 1945  although it has some memorably disquieting scenes  this story of long delayed justice is sustained by its melancholy more than its thrills  this central relationship both broke and enraptured my heart  benjamin and irene s slow waltz one round the other but both still just out of reach of touching keeping my pulse racing at an ever accelerating pace  a bit too symbolic for its own good 
1042,lebanon-2010,brutally real feeling  
1043,unstoppable-2010,packed with stunts that would make even tom cruise grimace  unstoppable is an adrenaline fueled action flick that leaves you at the edge of your seat until the very end  despite tony scott managing to maintain his high octane style  the relative simplicity of the plot gives unstoppable a more intimate feel than his usual bombastic actioner  director tony  scott is much better at building tension here than he was in 2009 s so average it hurt remake of the taking of pelham 123  tony scott has been applying hyper coloured flash to movies for three decades  but unstoppable  his two men against a runaway train logistical rollercoaster ride  is the first in some while where style and concept get on a treat  as this strangely dull story headed for the buffers  the forces dragging my eyelids south were unstoppable  very big train hits stuff  bish bash bosh  job done  great fun  think of speed or the car chase from bullitt  think of that first paying audience screaming at that first locomotive coming at them from the screen  11 decades ago in paris  france  it s a guilty pleasure  plain and simple  and if someone asked if i d head out to see it again i d answer in the affirmative without much in the way of hesitation  this isn t groundbreaking fare  mind you  but unstoppable muscles through its story of peril with crafted intensity and a few well placed grins  though inspired by a real incident  the movie is an opportunistic political allegory about an economy that s out of control and industries that are weakened by layoffs  under staffing and corporate callousness  
1044,rare_exports,santa shows his dark side in this wildly idiosyncratic horror flick from finnish writer director jalmari helander  rare exports turns out to be as heart warming as miracle on 32nd street  albeit in its own twisted little way

1048,cropsey,this disturbing true crime documentary takes its name from a local bogeyman that video makers joshua zeman and barbara brancaccio were warned about when they were growing up on staten island  
1049,buried,a nifty gimmick rarely translates into satisfying cinema  but buried qualifies as an exception  conveys the intensity and introspective horror of its subject s extreme life or death circumstances far more authentically and grippingly than the similar  flashier and shallower 127 hours  somewhere  edgar allan poe is uncorking a bottle of amontillado and laughing himself silly  sometimes cortes gets carried away with his  angry little film criticizing the world   but hell  when you re stuck making a movie in a box  it s easy to see why you d want to stand up  raise your arms and yell as loud as possible  rodrigo cortes directs and chris sparling wrote the screenplay  they and reynolds should be applauded  but you wonder who on earth is going to submit themselves to a film that is set exclusively in a coffin  there s something faintly quixotic about a filmmaker who  faced with technical limitations in a script  chooses to embrace them rather than fight them  such is the case with buried  an uncompromising suspense thriller from spanish director rodrigo cort s  an experiment in limitation that  at least until the movie s deflating final payoff  manages to tap into our deepest anxieties  by the end  i was quietly wheezing and whinnying with distress  reynolds s default has always been a sarcasm that s locked him out of seeming entirely human  in buried  he s neutralized  a brutally intense indie that commits to its bleak premise and doesn t back down  tarantino will cackle as he watches  
1050,untitled_eliot_spitzer_project,as corporate exposes go  it s best to stick with inside job  gibney doesn t have anything more than tantalizing clues and a huge amount of circumstantial evidence  but he doesn t need much more than that to indict wall street itself  you want tears  you want convulsive sobs  weepy remorse  pleadings for forgiveness  well  look elsewhere  because eliot spitzer isn t going to give them to you  he stretches the saga of spitzer a bit too thin with a nearly two hour running time that his story really can t support but this is still a mostly fascinating film  a sad  disturbing and in some ways tragic tale that in its lurid combination of sex and politics  banal hypocrisy and bare knuckles power  seems very much an american story of our times  the portrait of spitzer that emerges throughout client 9 is of a straight talking  no nonsense individual whose non political way of getting things done crafted a lot of enemies  client 9 works like a good detective novel  colorful and seemingly disparate characters are introduced  and then the strands that tie them together are revealed in a rich  sordid  thrilling tableau  it uncovers truths while framing events as a gripping whodunit  gibney puts mystery back into a story we thought we knew  i wonder how gibney operated the camera while on his back  
1051,winnebago_man,perhaps the most disturbing issue raised in ben steinbauer s fascinating and often hilarious winnebago man has to do with the internet s awesome ability to reduce complex and apparently dangerous behaviour to the level of banal spectacle  absorbing and thought provoking  although we find out a lot about this virtual hermit and develop an admiration for his cantankerous principles  the movie leaves some questions unanswered  the movie becomes oddly deep and even poignant  both the man and the film had reached outcomes that no one could have foreseen  this strange  darkly funny documentary investigates the story of jack rebney  a winnebago salesman who achieved notoriety based on outtakes of a corporate video he shot in the 1980s  winnebago man is an intriguing look at the effects on one man s life  whether they re worth the cost is something steinbauer leaves up to us  raises intriguing questions about our culture of online humiliation and the real life destruction it can leave in its wake  there is a genuine  human sympathy for his frustration and lashing out that goes along with the laughter   director ben steinbauer s  blend of exploitation and sincerity proves remarkably efficient  and helps illustrate how new media have democratized the arts  
1052,my-dog-tulip,affably voiced by christopher plummer  ackerley is at once enormously affectionate and beadily observan  while the clever graphic style marks the switch between straightforward narration and surreal doggy reverie  rarely has a needy bond between human and pet felt more unsentimentally and perfectly observed

1055,easy-a,while easy a might not be remembered ten years from now like such films as pretty in pink  pretty woman  and boomerang  but it s still a refreshing addition to today s genre  a sparkling moral tale about a small lie that ramifies out of control  the script shrewdly boosts its iq by working in parallels to nathaniel hawthorne s the scarlet letter and piling on 80s teen movie references  stone gives a terrific performance  her knowing drawl implying intellect and indifference with underlying warmth  the film goes for character based comedy rather than spiky one liners  so it s the cast s warmth that cements it as a five star movie  a cut above the usual teenage romance thanks to the potent presence of emma stone  a young actor who looks a bit like a youthful myrna loy and who has a refined sense of comic timing  as for emma stone  she didn t have to win me over  she conquered me from the first a  easy a belongs in the company of election  heathers  and mean girls    all motion pictures that have outlived their theatrical lives because they have unique voices and use them to say something  stone s charisma sells her preternaturally mature character and makes the script s snarky  pop culture referencing dialogue snap  gluck and royal do a nice job here  they ve constructed a teenage comedy that has sass and smarts  adults sure to enjoy it just as much as their adolescent counterparts  a comedy with a mega talented lead star and wonderful supporting actors all left adrift by a script that vacillates between satire and social commentary but never forgets to remind you that its characters are oh so clever  any movie that quotes mark twain  excerpts john hughes and employs a singeing british cussword normally unheard in pg 13 high school comedies   that s all right  too  more than all right  easy a might not ace it  but it scores a solid b  an extremely witty  inventive  sweet and perceptive coming out party for emma stone  enhanced by a wicked sense of humor  will gluck s movie does what hughes did best  showcasing characters with personality who make you wish you had them on speed dial  stone shows great self assurance and considerable comic chops in a tour de force that that could have seemed smarmy and or silly in lesser hands  
1056,scott_pilgrims_vs_the_world,energy and invention and audacity count for little unless you can sense something at its core   unless a film gives you something to feel   but there is zilch here  it s hollow  full of fresh  sharp touches and nonchalantly brash performances  scott pilgrim vs  the world consistently hits the sweet spot  fitfully entertaining and sometimes brilliantly silly   just not really engaging  and occasionally objectionable  i can only say that where some see shallowness  i saw a witty interplay of surfaces and style  this one s geek heaven  a mash up of comic books  computer games  grunge rock and slacker drama  all a little quicker and droller than anything of the kind before  scott pilgrim tries so hard to be loved that it ends up very trying indeed  a 112 minute entertainment contraption    celluloid that shapeshifts its frames into video games  comic books and sitcoms  wright packs each frame with so many nods  winks and nudges that he could be mistaken for a schizoid  a success and innovative achievement on every front  a film not to be missed not only because it sets a new standard for filmmaking  but because it s a blast as well  you need to take a step back to see the emotional heart of the story  an allegory of a generation struggling to exchange the solipsistic xbox triumphs for awkward real world love and empathy  you won t see anything like this again for a long time  it s an imperfect film that can get downright frustrating but it displays enough flashes of genius to warrant your time and demand your forgiveness of flaws  knowing self mockery is the name of the game

1058,10012063-ghost_writer,it is good to see polanski exercising his gift for the sinister  it s a spooky world he evokes here but its architecture doesn t hang together  which is a great pity  but for fans of the auteur able to separate his personal life from his cinematic one  and for others open to old school suspense where no one gets away clean and failure truly is an option  this political whirligig delivers the goods  the film will probably be better remembered as a faithful screen adaptation of the robert harris political thriller  whether or not polanski fully grasps the moral of his own excellent film remains to be seen  the script shows butterfingers habits when it comes to narrative detail  and the final revelation holds little interest  but polanski s approach is always magical  even when diluted  it casts a potent spell  the best thing i ve seen so far this year  a subtle visual stunner awash in creeping paranoia and anxiety  the result is a political thriller refreshingly long on grown up dialogue yet lamentably shy on  well  thrills  this chatty thing does go on  the swirl of visual poetry  political intrigue and personal zeal that polanski creates gets under your skin and brings an icy hand up your back  this is moviemaking

1060,terribly_happy,lurid and stylish  this 2008 danish feature plays like a cross between the postman always rings twice and high noon  with a dash of gothic thriller  entertaining and full of surprising twists  this highly cinematic tale of a copenhagen policeman working punishment duty in the provinces plays with genre in a manner that can be compared with the coen brothers or david lynch  terribly happy must surely be the greatest danish western ever made  ganz cooks up a compelling paranoid mood but there s not enough to sustain the tone  and eventually the movie burns itself out  the characters are intended to be slightly stupid  but the writing isn t necessarily smarter  genz creates a distinctive look and feel in the film  the town is drab  the people wrung out  and the moments of passion are smoothed back down into the tired routine  word is that danish director henrik ruben genz is planning to remake his latest film  terribly happy  in english  there s not much room for improvement  it may not sound funny  but there s a bleakly comic air about the story  and a bit of surrealism  suggesting the most caustic side of the coen brothers  terribly happy  directed by henrick ruben genz  is all moodiness  midnight black comedy and noir mystery  such dark doings won t be for everyone  but fans of similarly dry nordic fare   like the works of aki kaurismaki   will be happy to have found it  genz seems to delight in keeping viewers off guard  nothing is as it seems at first  and nothing ever plays out the way you expect  beneath the poker face of this wickedly entertaining film lurks an insinuating smirk on the verge of widening into a grin  this is a smart  melancholy crime picture  which takes its cues from the title of the perverse old standard christensen plays on her stereo at night   you always hurt the one you love   cedergren is a little too bland  but that works with hansen s air of haplessness and sets him apart from the colorful locals  this is one avant garde western  and film noir and psychodrama  that no one  pig bodine or otherwise  need recommend  it is wonderfully unhinged  and a painstakingly constructed meditation on a place where good and evil meet  mate  and make sour times sublime and  dare i say it  beautiful  
1061,hubble_3d,audiences expecting a blissout of swirling galaxies will wonder why so much time is spent on astronauts sweating over screws and bolts  
1062,alle_anderen,maren ade has created a minutely detailed portrait of people so exclusive they wind up excluding each other  
1063,white_material,a poignant  haunting study of well intentioned but doomed folly  embodied by a heroine whose bravery renders her blind to the world that is crumbling around her  a visually ravishing  structurally beguiling portrait of post colonial race conflict as a hallucinatory apocalyptic dream  a striking film filled with images that sometimes reveal their full meaning only when their beauty curdles in the chain of signification  almost everything here seems off  
1064,the_square,a taut  well executed if somewhat predictable riff on the murderous caper that goes wrong theme that has anchored sexy  blood stained crime pictures from the postman always rings twice to before the devil knows you re dead  there are no blacks and whites here just lots and lots of glorious gray  each flawed soul quickly coming to damning realizations that the choices they ve made might not have been the best ones after all  
1065,farewell,farewell has something you don t see very often  an endorsement blurb from ronald reagan himself    though there s a lot of ricocheting dialogue about grigoriev s penchant for keeping secrets and telling lies within the household  carion effectively maps the emotional minefield that stands between radical patriotism and family harmony  
1066,looking_for_eric,returns loach to the heights of riff raff and raining stones  winning stories of working class life whose politics were integrated rather than smeared on top  a wispy little comedy that uses fantasy to gloss over even the darkest and most intractable problems  
1067,1214097-despicable_me,another pixar wannabe rolls off the production line  reminding us why we should accept no substitutes  there are enough dashes of originality and narrative surprises to keep adults entertained  at least  it s no first rank cgi cartoon  but shows how pixar s quality over crass is inspiring the mid list  gru is a wonderful creation  the animation is consistently stylish  and those little gru helpers provide plenty of amusement as well  this dark family comedy with its steal the moon premise is hilariously over the top  yet understandable from a child s perspective  despicable me is darned cute  i know cute isn t to the lofty level of  message storytelling  but it can be entertaining to watch when done correctly  this animated thing pretty near out pixars pixar  the result is a sweet and witty bit of animated fun with both eye popping 3 d effects and a warm heart  there s a fine line between gleeful anarchy and wasted energy  and despicable me has a wonderful knack for staking out its spot and staying on the right side  so much is going on in this movie that  while there s nothing worth despising  there s not much to remember either  welcome to the on screen psychoanalysis of joan rivers  of which she seems equal parts willing participant and antagonist  
1068,red_riding_trilogy,what starts out as a tale of serial killing quickly becomes even more sinister and complex  if you think you are willing to start this journey across years of vile behavior  innocence lost  and true tragedy then go all the way  you won t regret it  fans of peace s books should be satisfied by their treatment here  although it bears asking just how many more serial killers  tortured cops and pretentious  fetishistic acts of violence the film audience can withstand  with a five hour running time  the hope is for an epic return on an epic investment  and that hope goes unanswered  you can see the films separately but you might as well see them one after the other  while the quality of the filmmaking varies  the sense of a vast provincial spider web of evil extending off the screen keeps you rapt in your seat  it s got a great sense of atmosphere in this really grim northern england country  it s not hard to forgive this series its lack of innovation  because it manages  for long stretches at least  to be something few serial killer dramas ever are  really  really good  the blood that runs through the red riding trilogy begins as a river that races and then rages until it floods this dank  dark  pitiless world in misery  direction of all three films is no more than workmanlike  which isn t surprising since they were originally made for british television  
1069,four_lions, morris s  new comedy has a provocative  ticklish premise    five north england muslims become suicide bombers  but can t decide who or what to take with them  it s difficult to imagine a movie this boldly provocative about the underworld of violent jihad  much less one that actually inspires laughter  the first feature  written and directed by satirist chris morris  may seem profane to some  but if you re doomed by watching it  at least you ll go down laughing  might this not have worked better  and conjured more startled outrage  as a mock documentary on tv  i think it s appalling in all the right ways  while its lingering aftertaste of ashes in the mouth is unmistakable  i d argue that the subject warrants it  these guys are not charming  they re horrifying in their ignorance  and they cause real damage  but there s a weird relief to be found in the opportunity to laugh ourselves sick at their expense  if only for an instant  the jihadis  absurdity is rooted in real life  but morris doesn t trivialize the danger they represent  while it isn t entirely successful beginning to end  the film has just enough on its mind and offers up more than enough laughs to make up for its shortcomings  impending doom is rarely this much fun to watch  
1070,art_of_the_steal,argott beautifully explicates how this crew pulled off the most daring daylight art theft in history  though his passionate identification with the pro barnes faction limits the movie s political nuance  while outraged aesthetes tell us that the barnes foundation is a perfect jewel box of a museum  the filmmakers they hired to argue their case don t spend enough time exploring or explaining what makes this cloister so special  
1071,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_1,every two minutes the action whooshes sideways to someone somewhere else  
1072,kisses2008,a coming of age drama so irish you ll want to take out your pogues  lyric sheets beforehand to brush up on gaelic mumbling  rewarding tale of two kids loose on dublin s mean streets with outstanding performances  there s nothing so frustrating as a small movie  made by a clearly gifted filmmaker  that flies close to magic only to be sternly jerked back to earth  kisses regards the world through fearful  foolhardy preadolescent eyes  only 75 minutes long and made in ireland for what had to be a micro budget  this sweet  savvy and heartfelt film will impact you more and stay around longer than many more elephantine productions  a superior lyrical ragamuffin irish drama about neighbor kids in a dingy outpost of dublin who run away from their crummy home situations at christmas and spend a picaresque night on city streets  a serendipitous journey worth taking  no one would claim that director lance daly delivers an emerald isle version of the spirit of the beehive  though this scrappy film does have a knack for capturing the elation and confusion of late childhood in their ragged glory  like arthouse roddy doyle it s ambitious and phoney in equal measure  
1073,north_face,slogs through an hour of frequently rote exposition until it hits its riveting groove when the rappelling and piton hammering take over  
1074,i_am_love,grandiose family drama packed with rich scenery  stirring performances and comprehensive camerawork   if only the rest wasn t so boring  despite a superb cast and a fabulous look  the picture collapses under the weight of its lofty pretensions  especially in the black hole of the last act  where it topples into near absurdity  the overripe ending  heated by the percolating music of john adams  is heavy seasoning on a delicate dish  an intimate  quiet and even slow movie  its subtle shadings veil turbulent emotions  i am love falls into the select category of films that are easier to admire than like  cinematographer yorick le saux s elegant images of buildings    stony exteriors  lux interiors    and weather worn statuary suggest centuries old tradition but also invite a meditative or appreciative silence  swinton s nuanced  aching performance is downright revelatory  you have an actress that plays just every moment for keeps without milking it  luca guadagnino did just a wonderful job of conveying this woman s emotional gathering storm  
1075,city_island,this feature might work better as a television series  but garcia himself gives the picture some much needed ballast  an at times marvellous muddle of high farce and low brow chuckles  andy garcia demonstrates real comic chops in this charming comedy of family dysfunction  writer director raymond de felitta has cut together a frustrating comedy  with the misunderstandings piling up like kindling for a bonfire that his movie never lights  writer director raymond de felitta is essentially offering a kinky comic new yawk version of a greek tragedy here  and even if the whole thing is pretty implausible  it s also fairly entertaining  all the performances are warmly engaging  even though the characters are broad and scenarios occasionally extreme  for those tired of clashing titans or weepy teen romances  city island is a breath of fresh air  the cast proves game for anything  from emily mortimer as vince s floridly english acting class partner to a beleaguered  bewhiskered strait  here displaying a comic prowess and fond knack for exasperation  the performances are absurdly broad  and each story line is more outlandish than the last  but de felitta s approach is so easygoing  and the waterside setting so irresistibly charming  you re bound to walk out in a great mood  the outer borough oddities of city island are hard to resist  another expertly written joyride through the confines of narrowminded provincialism to cleansing self awareness from indie director de felitta  
1076,cyrus,although hill certainly has been good in previous roles  this goes beyond what we ve seen  
1077,catfish,in a classic case of filmmakers prioritizing their own pitch over the actual goods  ariel schulman and henry joost put schulman s toothy grinned brother nev front and center as he investigates his fishy long distance facebook crush  
1078,1217700-kick_ass,forget thor  captain america  or anyone else the superhero movie craze has coming our way  i want more kick ass  this movie made me feel old and out of touch in a way i can t quite describe  and while i can t imagine that was vaughn s ultimate goal if it was to say he succeeded would be super powered understatement  i found it mighty painful sitting through all the bone crushing and blood letting  when filmmakers nudge a child into viewing savagery as slapstick  are we not allowing them to do what we condemn in the pornographer    that is  to coarsen and inflame  with a half dozen superhero movies every year that feel as if they were created by a hollywood blockbuster machine  it s so refreshing to see one with its own distinct  subversive personality  while it s by no means a perfect movie  it often feels like the purest distillation of adolescent male power fantasies ever portrayed on screen  here  the power is an extra dose of the hallmarks of adolescence an affect of ennui about everything but smashing through limits and a sense of irony about everything but sex  suggested subtitle  iron man  you just got served  prepare for amazement  this thing makes nicolas cage cool again  
1079,other_guys,this is the fourth feature that will ferrell and writer director adam mckay have collaborated on  and once again they deliver laugh out loud if ultimately disposable comedy with mixed messages about arrested male development  skewers the action genre while also finding room for sheer madness  as good and fleeting as a street corner popsicle 
1080,fair-game-2010,although the outline of this story is well known  fair game gives it dramatic shape and teases out the moral problems raised  it s a thriller that shows the twists and turns of fate with some skill but also rages effectively against the way the most powerful usually win  watts and penn are first rate as a married couple divided by their desperation to do right  while stylistically it s top notch  reality disguised as improbable thriller fiction  it s never clear whether sean penn is aware just how annoying his character is   or if he genuinely thinks his finger wagging smug  sack act is sympathetic  in a more urbane mode than we re used to  penn is his usual intense self but plays second fiddle to the magnetic centrepiece performance by watts  for every spycraft scene  every illustration of the deadly blowback from the leak that liman dramatizes  the movie has half a dozen scenes of a delicately balanced home life turned on its head by a government bent on destroying one of its critics  you d have to go back to all the president s men for a better example of fresh american political scandal being turned into slam bang  star powered drama  liman skillfully intercuts television news footage of the president and administration officials with a skilled cast of actors  the best surprise of the film is david andrews as scooter libby who shows us his mistrust of the career staff and his insecurity about the way they saw him  
1081,nowhere_boy,it relishes its myth making enterprise without getting too cute about it  
1082,mademoiselle_chambon,an impossible romance that is expressed delicately and without recourse to more than mild erotica  slow your pace and pause for breath and there s a world of pleasure to be had from this unhurried small town tragedy  too much of stphane briz s film is elegant water treading  but there are candid little scenes  and one of those will they won t they  brief encounter denouements that never go out of fashion  it hauls its bucket up slowly  we re not sure till the end  or even then  if there is much water in it  a charmingly direct film of simple contrasts about the difficulty of change  mademoiselle chambon is moving in spots  but it doesn t stir you the way the best films about heartache do  you feel for these two star crossed lovers  then forget about them the moment the movie is over  briz does score a nifty variation on the clichd rushing to meet destiny climax  but this encounter  brief indeed at a mere 90 minutes  doesn t fully convince  an exquisite chamber piece made with the kind of sensitivity and nuance that s become almost a lost art  small scale but big hearted french romance packs a wallop  this small  nearly perfect film is a reminder that personal upheavals are as consequential in people tm s lives as shattering world events  sandrine kiberlain is a fragile beauty and wonderful french actress who is not as well known here as she should be  perhaps mademoiselle chambon will help rectify that oversight  at its most gently successful  the movie is a character study with intensely baroque observations  
1083,made_in_dagenham,hawkins does all right by her role as written  but i kept imagining what she might have done if she wasn t required to be so unremittingly valorous  
1084,mesrine_killer_instinct,an exhilarating old school crime pic  
1085,disappearance_of_alice_creed,will keep your attention  but you may walk away thinking you ve seen something like it before  
1086,vision_2010,perhaps unsurprisingly  vision is didactic and a bit stilted although to be fair  so are most mainstream biopics rehashing historical events more familiar than this one  which presents its subject as a rousing protofeminist  there was obviously much to this woman  yet somehow visions feels curiously empty feeling  von trotta and sukowa create a very nuanced study of hildegard  one that imbues the figure with human foibles in a number sufficient to keep at bay any hagiographic impulses  although this true story offers numerous opportunities for skepticism and irony  director margarethe von trotta accords hildegard the respect of a proto feminist forebear and frames her in golden light like a vermeer painting  although von trotta seems to regard von bingen as some sort of medieval feminist precursor  there are enough fault lines in the portrayal to subvert hagiography  there are lengthy sections solely concerned with covering historical ground in which the platonic intimacy between the magistra and the pupil is completely forgotten  sukowa makes hildegard a likable and charismatic woman who risks a great deal to do good in an environment that leaves women little room for self expression  her intelligence and enthusiasm make her a proto feminist force to be reckoned with  von trotta  an icon of the new german cinema  doesn t have the technical chops for the fireworks you desire  so she settles for wan earnestness  vision is more immediate and immersive when dealing in the jealous attachments among sisters  when circumstance and politics tear richardis from hildegard  sukowa s performance rears to towering heights of abjection  
1087,casino_jack_and_the_united_state_of_money,auds will feel info glut over the course of the two hour plus film  which is hardly the desirable response for a piece of reporting on the vital issue of the corrupting effect of money in american politics  the narrative trots all over the globe  including stops for labor exploitation in the marianas islands  dealings with russian mobsters ripping off indian tribes in the desert southwest  and jetting to scotland to golf with impressionable politicians  that the film is overlong ultimately testifies to its importance  though after a while  the outrageous details start to run together like surreal satire  except  of course  that it s all true  gibney laudably launches a withering attack here on the pay to play relationship between lobbyists and lawmakers  but this viewer felt withered  too  by the end of his battering ram of a movie  casino jack is designed as an indictment of a whole culture of influence peddling  a beltway way of life where a pat on the back often comes with a kickback  it s an informative  interesting documentary that just barely comes together enough and tells an important enough story to merit a look  but it s not the film that it could have been  superlobbyist  republican wheeler dealer  and convicted felon jack abramoff may seem like old news right now    he s been trumped by bernie madoff et al     but what he represents  alas  is all too evergreen  the snarky tone  use of musical puns and jokey graphics  was keith olbermann an executive producer   undermine the impact of the story  it s a story well told  but abramoff s voice is missing  gibney interviewed him in prison but could not film him  you wonder what this sweet talker might say for himself  looking back over that long  ugly money trail  the crimes of conservative superlobbyist jack abramoff are already receding into the hopeless murk of congressional history  so this epic documentary by alex gibney is even more welcome for its reach  it s very entertaining as well as appalling  casino jack is audience friendly without turning into a michael moore ish clown show  
1088,the_good_the_bad_the_weird,imagine the sparseness of classic oaters matched with the energy of martial arts movies and you ve got what kim jee won has wrought  you don t feel the mad passion of sergio leone behind it  but a steadily spreading grin that never stops growing if you re going to attempt an ambitious action epic  you d better have the directorial chops to pull it off  kim clearly doesn t  a giddy mashup of sergio leone s spaghetti westerns and lucas and spielberg s indiana jones romps  this guns a blazing wide screen korean hit offers a nuttily staged  beautifully filmed  but kind of brainless homage to old school hollywood  it s hard to knock any movie that opens with an eye popping train robbery  followed by a balls out siege  and then a super cool heist  a slavish  supercharged riff on sergio leone s epic three the hard way spaghetti western  kim ji woon s all star spectacle wastes little time in lighting a fire under its unholy trinity s derrieres  some fancy setpieces here and there  and gunplay just about everywhere  but none of the principals can begin to rival the sacred trio of eli wallach  lee van cleef and the other one  
1089,mesrine_public_enemy_1,director jean francois richet and screenwriter abdel raouf dafri s movie generates much heat  but little light  this rambunctious and violent gangster drama more than sustains its lengthy running time  and makes one wonder why the gallic gun toter isn t better known internationally  
1090,cairo_time,clarkson lights up ruba nadda s stately drama cairo time like the moon on a summer night  making every moment luminous with quiet  resigned longing  a subtle  quiet  slow film that succeeds in not only burrowing under your skin and into your mind during its running time but has a remarkable ability to stay there for days and weeks afterward  if cairo time does not amount to much  it does evoke a wistful state of feeling and a complicated city with enough skill and sensitivity that you wish it had dared more  cairo time earns some indulgence for a pace that westerners may find languid  i was almost awed by the way it felt  looked and moved  the whole thing anchored by a pair of exquisite performances be clarkson and siddig that both rank as two of the finest i ve seen this year  
1091,tiny_furniture-2009,a deft self portrait of someone who hasn t reached the point where they can take themselves seriously  
1092,night_catches_us,for those people who are looking for a revealing glimpse into that social political cultural movement  this poorly conceived ode to the panthers is not illuminating  despite some on the nose dialogue and a needless revelatory flourish toward the end  hamilton gets at the strangeness of lived american history  in which violent ruptures leave behind poorly understood scars  february 1  2011 writer director tanya hamilton and two of today s most gifted actors have produced a sensitive drama with a powerful conclusion  anthony mackie and kerry washington nearly rescue the piece but it just doesn t come together into anything memorable enough to recommend  hamilton will no doubt make more polished movies  but this one has unusual atmosphere and emotional depth  and tackles subject matter no mainstream american film would touch without hazmat equipment  
1093,disneynature_oceans,its visual splendor more than makes up for its intellectual poverty  this monumental documentary gets intimate enough to hear a crab sneeze  horseshoe crabs scuttle like possessed nazi helmets and a school of fish morphs from dreidel to disco ball  as if choreographed by busby berkeley  it comes to american theaters saddled with narration by pierce brosnan  who purrs through the gratingly vague script like the world s plummiest old half drunken uncle  
1094,iron_man_2,if there were any new ideas  i failed to spot them  as did my bone marrow  which slept through most of it anyhow  as for the actual grand finale  downey jr  and cheadle seem like they re already network gaming the ps3 release instead of facing any actual threat  and rourke goes out like a chump  there s an outdated feel to it all  from its cold war view of america to the ac dc soundtrack  iron man 2 suffers from typical sequelitis  it bites off more than it can chew and feels drowsy as a result  rourke puts a human face  albeit a bashed one  on comic book villainy  those who wait through all of the credits will get a glimpse of what is in store for the next superhero saga  i hope between now and then they remember that less is more  if you re just going to see men in robot suits blow each other up while classic rock blares on the soundtrack  iron man 2 will do just fine    even the director   seems to view the heavy clanking of mechanized men as a bit of a chore  the kind of well prepared yet unremarkable meat course that must inevitably follow the delightful amuse bouche of robert downey jr  s portrayal of stark  superhero stark remains intriguing  it s a solid blockbuster with a few faults that you just don t mind overlooking  casting the likes of downey and rourke and then imprisoning them in jointed refrigerators is resource squandering of the highest order  the movie settles into a series of ho hum conflicts and complications  and the requisite slam bang ending is perfunctory at best  
1095,mother_and_child,what keeps the whole thing from toppling into an abyss of unwatchable tv drama histrionics is a pair of dynamite performances from annette bening and naomi watts  
1096,greenberg,noah baumbach again investigates psychologically screwed up people  although this time with much less comedic impact  
1097,countdown_to_zero,comes loaded with a relatively big budget and a line up of talking heads more powerful than a meeting of the bilderberg group  a bluntly effective media campaign as opposed to a well articulated documentary  at least it makes you scared again  there s nothing more frightening than what we ve learned to live with  walker adroitly mixes extensive newsreel footage  lively graphics and talking head interviews with dozens of people  from scientists to think tank folks to world leaders    
1098,1208173-splice,what makes splice morally compelling isn t the bioethics quandaries it raises so much as the way it delves into parenthood  the horror genre needs more films like this one  works made by filmmakers willing to take chances and deliver something to viewers that they would never expect  
1099,solitary_man,the film begins and ends with scenes of acute existential reflection  a state actors rarely convey convincingly least of all in a contemporary american film  koppelmans script is awash in phony scenarios  nobody does oily like michael douglas  the empty guy at the beginning of this movie is pretty much the same empty guy by its end  wicked  blunt writing  a great supporting cast and douglas doing variations of other sleazy womanizers he s played make this a tart  terse treat  you d think michael douglas has played the charming cad on screen once too often  but damned if he doesn t pull it off once more in grand style  solitary man may be about a man who has found himself on his own  but it features one of the best ensemble performances of the year  don t miss it  though this drama by writer director brian koppelman hardly measures up to wonder boys  it comes a lot closer than king of california  why do we keep watching this sad  sad man  because he s ecstatic as long as he avoids facing reality  and douglas makes that ecstasy a marvelous thing to behold  in its scruffy  take me or leave me way  it deserves attention  a sharp  small scale comedy of male misbehavior that turns out to be one of this dreary spring s pleasant cinematic surprises  
1100,harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_2011,for 10 years and eight films we ve gotten to watch these young actors grow as people  as performers and as characters  it has been a true coming of age saga  in the fullest and most moving sense of the term  the film is strong enough to have the unusual effect of improving its predecessors in the memory simply by association  fiennes and rickman get the actorly moments they ve been building toward for so long  and the film is most fun when it sticks to mechanics  roller coaster rides  battle scenes  close calls  one of the great things about this second deathly hallows is that it plays exceedingly well as either a stand alone epic or a continuation of the previous chapter  nothing can compare to the experience of reading j k  rowling s books  which have been expertly condensed and interpreted by screenwriter steve kloves  but given the need for compromise i think they ve done justice to the author s intentions  if not    in the 10 years since harry s first big  screen close up  the spell has never been broken  and we muggles have been made better for the magic  here at last  in the final chapter  the harry potter franchise rouses itself toward something approaching greatness   after eight installments  this last harry potter film finally left me wanting just a bit more  it s hard to imagine fans leaving the final potter film with deep disappointment in this satisfying conclusion  fasten your seat belts  harry potter and the deathly hallows  part 2 is an emotional roller coaster ride  it is not often that we can chart a series over 10 years featuring the same child stars as they grow into adults  this phenomenon gives deathly hallows 2 a particular poignancy  
1101,the_artist,you can t fault it as smart entertainment  which eschews parody to make a sincere tribute that also serves as cogent current commentary  
1102,a_separation_2011,you cannot watch the film without feeling kinship with the characters and admitting their decency as well as their mistakes  these people seem so real they might live next door  and they probably do  very few movies capture as convincingly as a separation does the ways in which seemingly honorable decisions can lead to interpersonal conflict    even disaster  partly a courtroom drama  partly a political satire and partly a twisty thriller that gradually draws you in and becomes more engrossing with each new revelation  the characters are deliberately ordinary  but their stories take on the weight of myth  put simply  this picture is one of the great cinematic achievements i ve ever seen  and in my opinion is the best film i saw in 2011  sometimes  in an attempt to do the best we can for the people we love  we end up wreaking irreparable damage  asghar farhadi s emotionally epic movie is not just a masterpiece dramatically  it is a movie dramatically of its moment  some films wear their artistry so lightly they appear simply to be happening  the inner workings of the story guided by an unseen hand  the film involves its audience in an unusually direct way  because although we can see the logic of everyone s position  our emotions often disagree  this is primarily a human story about a marriage unraveling  the husband torn between love for his daughter and devotion to his father  the daughter torn between one parent and the other  
1103,moneyball,recognizes that sometimes  happily ever afters are more complicated than uplifting hollywood films can manage  
1104,the_muppets,if you re not a joyless maniac with a soul of anthracite then you will work hard to imagine how this project could have been better handled  so genial  so joyous  and suffused with such a lip smacking sweetness  that the occasional pacing issues and subplot hiccups simply don t seem to matter  it s never cloying or too knowing  cynicism and wariness are real world concerns that have no place among the foam and felt  all of our old favorites are here  from fozzie bear and miss piggy to the original grumpy old men  statler and waldorf  along with a number of celebrities in amusing cameos    it is with immense pleasure that i can report that disney s muppet reboot movie is an absolute delight

1106,drive_2011,i ll never forget the first time i saw drive  i ve since never been able to replicate the experience  what it had going for it was an uncanny and moving relationship between gosling and mulligan  nicolas winding refn s drive is an ambient mood piece that his you like a shot of nitroglycerine enhanced adrenaline yet goes down as smoothly as an expensive slug of single malt  ultra violent  ultra tedious  bargain basement rip off of the classic 1978 walter hill film the driver  while you could lean back and nod along to refn s posturing  the film plays more like an exercise in turn of the eighties nostalgia  a movie length strong silent swagger inspired by the art on a vhs box  a more or less conventional los angeles set hot rod getaway driver movie with neo noir decoration    albeit satisfying enough on its own terms  drive is a masterpiece of surface over depth  catnip for anyone who thinks cinema is for the eye rather than the brain or heart  by no means perfect  although it s hard to process the flaws while your insides are singing and you can t catch your breath  a unique blend of classical tropes and modern filmmaking  it s the kind of movie magic that we don t see every friday night at the theaters anymore  the extreme and escalating violence will prove off putting to some frankly  i m surprised not to have been among them but for the rest  drive is a needle punch of adrenaline to the aorta  in reworking genres without quoting shamelessly  refn proves himself his own man and a guy quite capable of taking us places we didn t even know we wanted to go

1110,mission_impossible_ghost_protocol,although it lacks some of its original slickness and more surprising twists  ghost protocol really breathes new life into the franchise  mission  impossible   ghost protocol is  in a word  awesome  better than that  it is the first film in tom cruise s tv to feature series that i have enjoyed start to finish  beginning to end and for every single moment of its two hour plus running time   mission  impossible ghost protocol  is sheer hurtling mechanism and it s great silly fun  perhaps we shouldn t expect too much in the way of character in this kind of thing   but action always seems more fun when it s done by real people  solid entertainment  a lot of credit goes to cruise here  who s succeeded over these four films in making ethan hunt into a strangely intriguing alter ego  cruise  does his own stunts   these include the smirk  the hair toss  the head jut  the finger jab and all the other cruise athleticisms we know and  if hard pressed by hollywood  love  it s kind of flat  inert   occasionally spectacular but not all that exciting  
1111,nostalgia_for_the_light,a seriously remarkable documentary essay from the chilean filmmaker patricio guzmn  you wait all year for a thought provoking movie essay on life  art  science or history  then in nostalgia for the light all four arrive together  a truly eye opening experience  a truly insightful art film that still manages to be easy going and unpretentious  a nearly unbearable examination of good and bad in the human heart  guzmn offers a poetic narrative that celebrates the searches and insists on the moral obligation to remember chile s not too distant past  the filmmaker s masterpiece  an exquisitely filmed  poetically written meditation on how past and present fuse in humanity s most unresolved questions   i am convinced that memory has gravitational force   says guzmn in conclusion   nostalgia  states his case so beautifully that even skeptical physicists will be thoroughly convinced  katell djian s stunning cinematography adds to the film s power  the film s passionate insistence on remembrance lends it a moral as well as a metaphysical weight  mr  guzmn s belief in eternal memory is an astounding leap of faith  has the overwhelming power of an outrage to decency  nostalgia for the light isn t didactic in the strictest sense  it simply shows the truth  illuminated by  patricio guzman  s poetic voiceover narration and the found sound of wind and footsteps that echo across the desert plains  
1112,everyday_sunshine_the_story_of_fishbone_2011,narrated by laurence fishburne  its in depth interviews with band members  friends and fellow musicians from the punk ska scene of the late 1980 s make it so you don t have to be a fan of fishbone to be enthralled by their story  it s a hearty  thoughtful  smartly assembled  vaguely complete documentary about a rock band that  even by the standards of out there musical acts  seemed out there both in the mid 1980s and even now  what makes this better than the usual behind the music style doc is the frankness of its subjects and the fun way the filmmakers intersperse fat albert style animation to tell their story  it seems telling just how many other musicians were willing to participate in the documentary to attest to the outfit s influence  it all comes together for a rollicking chronicle of verve and nerve  directors chris metzler and lev anderson seem to have considered several different approaches for their film and settled on all of them  effortlessly entertaining  there s just enough uncut truth and soul in fishbone s story to keep die hard boneheads skankin  to the beat  even if it s just for nostalgia s sake  packed with fantastic performance footage  it solidly makes the case that  throughout the  80s and early  90s  fishbone was one of rock s best live acts ever    furiously energetic  innovative  leaping multiple genres in a single song  many bands have a might have been story  but few have a story that reflects such rich and paradoxical ideas  those of us lucky enough to have seen the punk  funk and ska band in a sweaty nightclub might have borrowed a different title   party at ground zero   
1113,bill_cunningham_new_york_2010,whatever this times produced  tv ready tribute lacks in tension is amply compensated by the pleasure of watching an enthusiast ply the craft he loves  filmmaker richard press offers a humorous  touching and insightful portrait about a subject who clearly would have preferred to stay behind the camera  equally at home chronicling the latest fashions on the street and the biggest celebrations among manhattan s aristocratic swell set  he might as well be the city that forms his vast canvas

1117,hugo,it is a miraculous achievement that  during this home stretch  engages on levels and in ways few other films can admit to  and as such makes a decided case to be considered as one of the year s finest achievements  hugo is cinema shining a light reverently up its own fundament  scorsese transforms this innocent tale into an ardent love letter to the cinema and a moving plea for film preservation  hugo s best moments are those that aren t actually hugo  it is glorious to be thrown and blown about in this make believe metropolis  the digitally enhanced shapes and colours suggest jeunet and caro reworked by a polychromatic piranesi  it s possible to see the attraction  but when people break into applause over the credits  some are going to be left cold  it might be curtains for celluloid  but scorsese  a boyish 69  clearly isn t leaving the stage any time soon  he directs every film with the passion of his first  and it shows  thematic potency and cinematic virtuosity    the production was designed by dante ferretti and photographed by robert richardson    can t conceal a deadly inertness at the film s core  it s a fairy tale for mature viewers  but the airy exterior hides emotional depth  one of the most magical viewing experiences of the decade so far  
1118,midnight_in_paris,this combination of whimsy and romance is  for me  much more successful than allen s previous european city film  vicky cristina barcelona  it s passable woody waffle designed strictly for fans  midnight in paris contains sequences happier than can be described  if allen s next stop on his euro tour is anywhere near this enjoyable  consider our bags packed  in the end it s about seeing through the illusion of nostalgia and yet not being disillusioned   about cherishing the past  while living in the present  allen holds onto his vision of a golden age better than anyone else  even while readily acknowledging that it s just a grand illusion  considering allen hasn t made an unqualified success since 1999 s sweet and lowdown  it s easy to shrug off midnight in paris  occasional fumble when weighed against so much cleverness and canniness and  bien s r  irresistible charm  our hero has found his groove among the lost generation and  for us  there s some amusement to be had in sharing gil s thrills    it s like stepping into a classic comics version of a moveable feast  woody allen attracts promising players and does nothing with them  there is breezy comedy to be made of a youtube age writer meeting the icons and idols of a bygone  classical era  but allen goes deeper  expanding on his time travel device to make unexpected and unexpectedly generous observations  i find this upfront fantasy to be his funniest  most agreeable comedy in years  woody allen s beleaguered heroes have never been reluctant to indulge in a little fantasy to get what they want

1120,bridesmaids_2011,sure  it neatly avoids a lot of the fluff found in many chick flicks and replaces it with crass shenanigans  but it adds touching moments when they re needed most  providing for a smart  less clich d comedy  unashamedly smart    bridesmaids has been hailed as a groundbreaking blow for american female cinema  that says a lot about the extent of hollywood s current conservatism  but for now  bridesmaids does nicely as a tonic corrective  onetime saturday night live castmates wiig and rudolph make annie and lillian s friendship believable  which is why annie s shenanigans are sad    and hilarious  the movie won t change your life or grab a fistful of oscar nominations come next winter  but it will make you laugh  hard and often  and it proves that sometimes girls just want to have fun  is it funny  yes  at times  and its female centric theme will appeal to many women  i just hope they have the patience to trudge through the slow spots and story detours  bridesmaids  which might as easily bear the title women behaving badly sharply written and winningly performed  it delivers more laughs than any movie released this year  but also  the longer it goes on  develops into a surprisingly poignant evocation of self scuppering loneliness  the full horror of being a bridesmaid is shown  but wiig persuades you there is something genuinely loving and sisterly to be found at the end of this incredible ordeal  really  bottom line  it s the best thing apatow s put his name to in years  an effortless blend of bad taste and good humour with a wholly believable  often very touching emotional core  all centred around one of the finest star making comic performances in recent memory  finally  a female ensemble comedy that balances realistic characters with smart laughs and side splitting farce  completely and utterly honk like a goose hilarious  
1121,win_win_2011,win win isn t a morality play  it s just a really good story  but it does deal with an issue that couldn t be more relevant  where do we draw the line when it comes to survival if it means clouding our sense of right and wrong  trying to please a crowd needn t be a shameful business  tom mccarthy makes light comedies that notice the goodness and hospitality in unlikely people  yet stop short of sentimentalising them  for all its witty observations on the trials of modern manhood  it never strays out of its blinkered suburban comfort zone  riffs engagingly on the quiet desperation of ordinary  decent folk who find themselves in a fix  who take the wrong road for the right reasons  although there are times when win win feels a bit self consciously whimsical  it rings much truer than most  what s just delightful about this wittily observed and touchingly truthful affair is the fact it offers consistently sherbety entertainment in the moment but ultimately holds to its purpose of saying something useful and genuine about real lives  funny  agreeable and thoroughly enjoyable  if a little bit too neat and fortuitous in sorting out its entangled strands  trundles along for the most part in sitcom fashion  even down to the plinky plonky background music  mccarthy has established himself as a craftsman of conventionally quirky pictures that are entirely about ingratiating themselves with the audience  within those limited parameters  win win works  giamatti excels as the weak kneed mike  nicely working his gift for inner conflict and outer bumbling  as his wife  amy ryan is a ballast of unflinching moral certitude  in the end the film stacks up just this side of twee  as the sort of quirky fare that s passably entertaining without ever offering anything real or remarkable  
1122,5050_2011,the honesty driving this picture is undeniable and is evident in every frame  adam a compelling protagonist and for my part i couldn t take my eyes off of him  this frequently funny and moving film proves humour can be wrung from tricky subjects  providing it s done with sufficient thoughtfulness and wit  so well meaning you want to hug it  whether you re after a comedy drama about cancer or a rogen laugh fest with added heart  this does a remarkable job of balancing the odds  add 50 50 to your want to see list  and then make an appointment for your annual physical with your doctor  still  it s gordon levitt s choices that continue to impress  sure  he owned one of the most jaw dropping sequences in last summer s blockbuster inception  but the actor remains drawn to profoundly human scale hurts and quiet triumphs  chances are about 90 10 that you ll enjoy 50 50  the tightrope act of a script by will reiser is elevated in remarkable ways by one of the best ensembles of the year  led ably by the great joseph gordon levitt  doing career best  oscar nomination worthy work  
1123,born_to_be_wild_2011,one way or another you ll find yourself saying   awwwwww   a terrific big screen 3d film about the rescue of baby elephants and orangutans by dedicated humans introduces young people to a strong conservation ethic  few will be unmoved by the two women s courage and persistence  though morgan freeman s intoning voiceover is less persuasive  a nice family outing  this  but those after an in depth discussion had better look elsewhere  a decent weekend diversion  this imax documentary is cute enough to engage your kids  while teaching them the most basic lessons in ecological responsibility  their stories are touching and inspiring  but let s face it  the visuals are what make this movie  born to be wild takes you to places you ve never been and makes you wish you had  the hip soundtrack adds momentum  and the reassuring narration of morgan freeman lets us know these lucky orphans will have a fighting chance for survival after taking their first steps    or swings    back into the wild  given the sheer scale of the format  imax provides an ideal context in which to experience 3d  allowing the eyes to wander about each periphery filling frame and focus on whatever catches our interest  the way we do in the real world  it s sort of poetic justice that the wretched  sucker punch  is getting kicked off four manhattan imax screens after just two weeks by this charming nature documentary  although it runs just a fleet 40 minutes  the film proves a rich and memorable journey  wholesome and educational  teaches right from wrong  and brings up some important environmental issues  some animal parts  it turns out  are perfectly suited to 3 d  none more so than an elephant s trunk  
1124,13_assassins_2011,13 assassins looks at honour from many angles  without becoming simplistic  ichii hasn t lost his edge after all  this slam bang remake of a 1963 feature by eichi kudo builds slowly  accumulating characters and themes  then explodes into a prolonged and masterful battle sequence inside a deserted town  one can pinpoint the exact moment when 13 assassins transforms from vivid samurai drama to insane work of genius  though 13 assassins  setup could stand some tightening  it s all necessary prelude to a spectacular  action packed final hour where all hell breaks loose and the streets and rooftops flow with blood  the dialectic about duty may not translate to a modern western audience  but the savage sword fighting is to die for  a richly cathartic experience with a wide range of emotional colors  miike s magisterial craftsmanship is beyond doubt as he sets up another complex study of violence and its implications  miike directs the  village of death  battle with an astonishing relentlessness  just when you think you ve seen the last bout of flesh skewering  he tips another bloody bucket of slaughter into the mix  what s special about 13 assassins is a 45 minute battle scene in which 13 heroic warriors take on the vastly superior army of a wickedly sadistic shogun lord  13 assassins musters nearly twice as many swordsmen as kurosawa s seven samurai and is about two thirds as good  although it delivers the requisite genre thrills  
1125,pariah_2011,you don t have to be black or lesbian or even know someone who s gay to appreciate  pariah   you just have to have gone through or be going through the process of growing up  rees tells alike s story in vignettes that are sometimes slapstick  sometimes heartbreaking  always tender  especially rewarding about oduye s performance is how she s able to portray that frustration while retaining hope and optimism  first time feature filmmaker dee rees has crafted a movie that is consistently riveting because it is steeped in truth  she and her cast never once strike a false note  adepero oduye is excellent as a brooklyn teen coming to terms with her sexual identity in this gritty film

1133,silent_souls,full of striking visual images and fragmentary half truths   a dour meditation on love and death that arrests and alienates in equal measure  aleksei fedorchenko s crisp  beautiful film ponders the oddness and necessity of the folk rites in which we all seek solace  fedorchenko may not exactly be on oath with all of these meryan traditions of his  but they create an utterly distinctive world  and the close harmony provided by a choir in one scene really is arresting  the wheels within wheels of sly tale spinning turn quietly  turn deep  an incredibly moving and masterfully controlled experience  stunningly photographed for the wide screen silent souls is another indication that the russian cinema  despite its problems  is still capable of producing major work  it s lovely and slow and melancholic and short   75 minutes  yet you feel you ve been gone for an epoch or two  rife with earthy details and poetic associations  the movie often advances like a daydream  this profound and immensely touching film in only 75 perfect minutes achieves the profundity of an epic  there s a trancelike quality to its best moments  but too much of it is artfully boring  director alexei fedorchenko doesn t use sheer duration to immerse viewers in the spiritual journey  not counting the credits  this beautifully photographed and quietly evocative movie is barely 70 minutes long  
1134,the_arbor_2010,what emerges is a curious mix of avant garde technique and social realist case study  equally indebted to barnard s art world video background and dunbar s own close to the bone writing  numerous celluloid experiments have fudged reality and fiction lately  but few are as formally inventive or socially revelatory as the arbor  brings the dunbar story to life through a technique known as  verbatim theater   in which actors lip synch testimony from the real people they re portraying  a bold experiment that doesn t quite work  barnard revisits the foredoomed career and tragic afterlife of this slum born self educated writer to electrifying effect  shooting mainly on location in bradford  with actors lip synched to actual recordings of the people they portray  a mother daughter tragedy presented in a cinematic hall of mirrors  the arbor aestheticizes its grim nonfiction narrative with mixed results  barnard has created a modernist  compassionate biopic  a tribute to her memory and her embattled community  this is a deeply resonant piece of filmmaking that leaves you sure of one thing    there s always more than one truth  
1135,coriolanus_2010,it s genre writing that entertains while tapping into enduring truths  when caius martius heads into battle against the invading volscians  we get 20 odd minutes of brutal street fighting with rpgs and crackling automatic weapons  the film was shot in serbia  dial a few decades back and it could have been set there  visually and dramatically it works well it s shakespeare by way of black hawk down but as an allegory of modern day geopolitics it doesn t really go anywhere  i admired the movie even though i found it neither fish nor fowl

1137,senna,a psychologically intriguing if at times too hagiographic portrait of a man who often held pole position in his profession and felt nearer to god because of it  undeniably gripping stuff  even if you can t tell formula one from grecian formula  senna is pretty exciting stuff  most interesting for the way its construction builds on the inherent austerity of auto racing  real life eclipses fiction in delivering a tale that combines heroism  villainy  suspense and a surprising amount of emotional resonance  the new documentary senna has all the full throttle momentum and sweeping emotion any big budget feature could hope for  the movie s assemblage of audio interviews poured mostly over astounding race footage is fit for a shrine  plays like a narrative feature  juicy and alive  with enough kinetic excitement to hook the formula one ignorant  me  i knew next to nothing about the subject   let alone racing fans worldwide  there are some thrilling you are there sequences shot inside the racing car from his pov as he zooms around the tracks  it s like watching a video game made real  
1138,of_gods_and_men,there are numerous sequences of tremendous emotional power here  none more so than one in which the monks gather together to sing an ancient gregorian chant as an algerian army helicopter gunship hovers threateningly overhead  
1139,x_men_first_class,the acting  special effects  and writing were excellent  except possibly the two times xavier tries to hit on women in bars by saying they have  groovy mutation s    first class can safely be watched by first timers  but old faithfuls of the franchise will get a little more  tracing the origins of their favourite characters  if you didn t see the previous movies  you may not be able to appreciate some of the subtle references  but that won t make you enjoy the movie any less  check it out  in truth  the film is a very conventional summer potboiler repackaged in reasonably pretty  moderately crisp wrapping paper  in short  not quite groovy enough  in some glorious zone between mad men and thunderbirds comes this x men prequel  as kinetic as it is character driven  and full of ridiculous retro pleasures  why be so harsh and long winded about a superhero movie  because it s an ambitious superhero movie  as x men films go  this one gets the job done and is certainly better than last stand or wolverine  but there are still just too darn many x men  looks and feels like a very cheesy cold war era b movie    easily chimes in as the best  most engaging and visually impressive x film so far  serviceable but seems more dutiful than dynamic  and is muddled by all sorts of random false notes  this blazing  pre boot  breathes new life into the sagging franchise the film is ultimately undone by that old paradox of hollywood movie production  if you are given enormous budget  you have to spend every penny  
1140,the_descendants_2011,wants to be mature but can t help shortchanging its drama through constant reliance on its protagonist s unimpeachable nobility  in playing an everyman stranded between anger and duty  clooney earns an emotional payoff that a lesser actor would simply demand

1142,incendies,normally i m against decent original stories being dumbed down and squashed into bog standard thriller shapes  but incendies is in dire need of some dumbing down  
1143,tabloid_2010,operates as both an examination of the dominating media mentality at the time and an embodiment of it  no less keen on delving into the juicy details now as tabloid rags were then  morris suggests that you can sometimes find profundity in triviality   and though joyce condemns herself out of her own mouth  it is always possible to feel sorry for a woman whose obsession has so totally ruled her life  the movie is guilty of condescending toward its subjects  though most of them appear to be having a fabulous time telling tales  
1144,into_the_abyss_2011,the extensive use of lurid crime scene videos and subtitles set in a naff typewriter font sit uneasily with the director s opposition to capital punishment  when tolstoy said all unhappy families are unhappy in their own ways  perhaps he was thinking of texas  but even he reckoned without the rich  extraordinary complexities of unhappiness chronicled in herzog s film  into the abyss does what too few documentaries these days do   it gives ample play to all sides of the argument  herzog allows us to think things through on our own  herzog s investigation may not work as an anti death penalty editorial  but its findings are undeniably profound  
1145,the_girl_with_the_dragon_tattoo,overall the movie does take allegiances with both the book and original movie  but it comes into its own to unravel a truly alluring story  was it really worth the effort  for all fincher s famously fanatical control  he can t dispel the stench of half baked cheese that hangs over the source material  i could not take my eyes off the film and never once wanted to exit the theatre  all of which are attributes i don t want to diminish or dispute in any way whatsoever  this is a finely honed genre thriller  but it also continues fincher s preoccupation with the persistence of age old urges in the modern world  the movie feels like a cartoon  brilliantly achieved but utterly shallow  fincher s dragon tattoo rockets through the freezing northern european landscape like the most powerful car on the market  we know what will happen and it s still riveting  mara s efficient  straightforward physicality and her watchful but implacable expression are just right for the character who is about to kick the hornet s nest  immaculate style  questionable substance  an altogether leaner  meaner  more high powered  stylish  and deftly directed affair  though similarly hampered by a too long narrative fuse  even fincher s elegantly gruesome style can t turn this swedish noir into the meditation on evil and corruption that it fancies itself to be  an entertaining 2 5  hours for those who don t mind plot details sliding right by  but for the rest  insufficient resources to piece together the investigation is fairly frustrating  
1146,rango,rango is a superbly written  masterfully shot feat of making us believe that yes  ugly critters can also possess the kind of heroic qualities that this world needs more of  just when you thought you d seen everything  here comes chinatown  the animated version  the film unspools as an admittedly bizarre blending of an animated adventure film for kids and a meta comedy about a character who must morph from being a fictitious hero to being a real one  there s more visual wit in gore verbinski s rango than the last two pixar films combined  adults and slightly older children should have a great time  what elevates it above a cheeky romp is the skilled cgi work  not only the wealth of tactile detail lavished on the parched townsfolk but also the painterly  sand swept vistas they call home  
1147,king_of_devils_island_2011,imagine a cool hand luke that swaps out star vehicle pleasures for gray scandinavian suffering  and you d have something like marius holst s prison drama set in 1915 norway

1151,contagion_2011,a bit of a mixed bag at times  its overall well developed character sketches and good performances will certainly keep the attention of moviegoers and no doubt increase dvd sales  as well as  perhaps  sales of purell   no  soderbergh and burns are more interested in tackling this scenario from an almost unbearably direct and unambiguously straightforward journalistic perspective  as disaster celeb loaded disaster movies go  it could have been a lot worse  the all star disaster movie genre is taken out of the 1970s and given a stylish and largely persuasive 21st century makeover by director and cinematographer steven soderbergh  ever the cerebral essayist  soderbergh isn t in this for edge of your seat thrills   his approach is more cold sweat than burning fever  another soderbergh studio job well done  a starkly effective ensemble drama which could well do for the sniffles what jaws did for great whites  if you re looking for some kind of poetry some exalted dramatic arc that lifts this narrative out of the ordinary you won t find it here  contagion is   gripping from start to finish  if sound it out never really digs its claws into its material  it at least approaches it with a careful level of thought and commitment  along with the stars  contagion has plenty of scares  though in contrast to matt damon and kate winslet  they re things you encounter every day

1153,the_tree_of_life_2011,malick s earnest pretentiousness surely invites derisive laughter  but it also withstands it  and like the ancient evergreen of its title  it towers benevolently over less ambitious movies    ideally  you would bathe in a film like this without striving to decipher it  as it s a film about what we can t get our heads around  we are probably not meant to get our heads round it  but  even so  it is so audacious it will take your breath away      it s too bad what could have been a beautifully crushing family drama was usurped by a massive amount of unnecessary special effects clouding the real story  it s difficult to shake the sense of it as the spectacle of a man gone deep sea diving in his own navel  an extraordinary vision of first contact  not between two cultures but between a soul and the universe  one for the history books  the tree of life pushes american cinema into regions uncharted since stanley kubrick s heyday  all that really emerges is that terrence malick   has  stanley kubrick style  fermented into a filmmaker with a glacial output who begs to be deciphered rather than enjoyed  you don t watch the tree of life so much as loll in front of it  it s part puzzle  part coming of age tale  part wildlife documentary  and all mind blowing  sections of malick s expansive  fitfully brilliant  occasionally sloppy film are so powerful that you can only gaze up at the screen in wordless awe  in this flawed yet masterful  unforgettable movie  malick argues that even the tiniest mote can have value  he sees miracles everywhere  you just have to make an effort to see them  too  glibly put  this challenging time skipping rumination is the big screen equivalent of watching that  tree  grow  the result actually plays like a divine pronouncement  cosmic in scope and oracular in tone  a cinematic sermon on the mount that shows its creator in exquisite form  exquisite but frustrating  
1154,the_black_power_mix_tape_1967_1975,by resisting the impulse to let present day moralists tamp the story into safe hindsight shape    it allows us to glimpse rawer and more remarkable elements of mutual transformation in real time  olsson includes material that might typically have been considered outtakes and lets clips play at length  reinforcing an impression of intimacy with the participants in the scene  it s thrilling to hear from unrepentant revolutionaries such as angela davis and amusing to hear from their bell bottomed white lawyers  the black power mixtape 1967 1975 is not your standard documentary dealing with racism in america  it is not a comprehensive history but the footage is an extraordinarily potent reminder that the stand taken by black people eventually bore fruit  interesting stuff  though it sometimes looks like a block of unedited raw material  blazing interviews with angela davis and stokely carmichael supply stinging and unforgettable rhetoric  it simply can t fail with footage this wild  while it assumes a fair bit of knowledge of the social changes exploding in sixties america  there s a wealth of fascinating material and punchy insights into an earth shaking movement  you watch the material here and wonder whether most of the movies made about black people are meant to pacify general audiences  to distract them from demanding more of the movies  this chronicle of pride and social upheaval is filled with vintage images and important voices  the black power mixtape includes plenty of interest  but it would be stronger if the filmmakers had dug a little deeper into the footage from 1967 to 1972 and skipped the final years altogether  you are left in a bracing state of confusion  wondering how much has changed and how the change took place  because olsson is working exclusively with film shot by other people  with their own 40 year old agenda  he loses some of what decades of reflection  reconsideration  and historical context could ve brought  
1155,certified_copy,were it not for the transcendent presence of binoche  and her transfixing cleavage   i suspect certified copy might feel even more like homework  the conclusion is abrupt and unsatisfying  but the philosophical dialogue kiarostami manages to keep aloft for well over an hour touches on intriguing questions of openness  self honesty  and personal freedom  the movie threatens to become a sketch about a coquette and a boor squabbling at each other to little effect  there s a divinely comical lightness to binoche here  even in states of conniption and complaint  she s floating  albeit manically  the iranian writer director abbas kiarostami has always been enthralled by the shifting planes of fantasy and reality  his latest film  certified copy  is his fullest expression of that entrancement  a film as audacious and radical as any likely to see theaters this year  it is a calm sort of dream  a serious work about love and truth and fraudulence and authenticity done with a mysteriously light touch  kiarostami never completely spells things out  assuming audiences can think for themselves and appreciate all the film s subtleties and reverberations  let s hope he s right  kiarostami has a wonderful star in juliette binoche and an interesting find in william shimell  a british opera singer making his dramatic film debut  it is literate and engrossing  with excellent performances by binoche  who won the best actress prize last year at cannes  and shimell  in his screen debut  despite its modernist sensibility  there is little reason to be intimidated  unless you find the character of james abhorrent  
1156,point_blank,if the storyline doesn t amount to much more than b movie leftovers  there isn t an ounce of fat on them  an exhilarating adrenaline rush with breakneck momentum so shrewdly calculated that you could imagine its french director  fred cavay  standing by with a heart rate monitor  
1157,cormans_world_exploits_of_a_hollywood_rebel,none of it gets us anywhere truly close to the beating heart of an essentially retiring figure  the movie delivers a compelling argument for appreciating the filmmaker as a major artist who s both largely responsible for many mainstream hollywood cinema trends while somehow remaining superior to them  an excellent introduction to a director equally adept at following his own vision and nurturing those of others  
1158,buck,meehl roots this redemption tale in carefully observed demonstrations at his clinics  even as the gorgeously shot landscape reminds us why stories like this are hollywood s very lifeblood an unforgettable film about an extraordinary man  
1159,submarine-2010,a cool  well directed  if somewhat sterile and self consciously quirky affair about teen awkwardness  virginity  infidelity and dead end marriages  all of this makes it sound as if ayoade is trying much too hard but the gentleness of his touch succeeds in keeping pretentiousness safely out of the picture  there have been any number of movies about the problems faced by teenagers when they fall in and out of love  but the team behind submarine seem to have got it all just right  that rare teen comedy where the kids aren t gorgeous  the hero isn t heroic and the object of desire has a lot of reasons why she isn t necessarily desirable  an exercise in briny welsh weltzschmerz that tracks the inner and outer worlds of a confused teenage boy  submarine pulls off the difficult trick of being bittersweet without being saccharine and does so with a quietly riotous aplomb  for an unreliable narrator  oliver s story is reliably entertaining  whatever flaws the film may have  it s certainly unlike anything else in theaters right now  these things could have easily resulted in a mass outbreak of broad comedy  but the actors play their roles completely straight  in submarine  you truly ache through the awkward moments    even as you re laughing out loud  there are no really profound insights in  submarine  except this  that you ll never really know another person unless you re willing to take the plunge  ayoade is better at establishing a road map of what  submarine  is supposed to be rather than pulling all its elements together cohesively  i suggest you take a chance on  submarine  and find out if its particular comic angst rings any bells  be you male or be you female  welsh or american  16 or 61  
1160,margin_call,greed isn t merely good here  it s god  and he s about to smite his acolytes with blazing old testament relish  chandor proffers a cross section of a lehman brothers esque company as the realisation dawns that sub prime speculation has brought the market to an ominous tipping point  topical drama about the financial crisis lacks the visceral punch to grab an audience  it s a realistic take on what happens when high flying money speculators suddenly hit ground  it s also a great calling card for j c  chandor  the writer director making his feature debut  
1161,the_trip_2011,terrific stuff  fuelled by some inspired and very funny improvisations   their duelling michael caine impersonations are a scream   the film gradually settles into a meditation on mid life malaise  much more than an appetizer  if not quite a main course  it definitely goes down a treat  think the odd couple with sartorial style and more bickering  add hints of truisms about middle age  sex  family  mortality and the limits of friendship and the trip reveals itself to be more than it initially appears  the trip works surprisingly well on the big screen as one continuous tale  that s down to its two leading men  who clearly relish sharing screen time with one another  the joy of this small  unimportant contest is weirdly addictive  you come out of the film as if from a concert  playing the music of false voices in your head   the  humor in this film is so strong and so overpowering there were more than a few instances where my gut began to hurt because i was laughing so hard  have you ever been trapped in the back seat of a car while the old married couple up front bickers and banters for hours  it s either sheer torture or  if the couple happens to be steve coogan and rob brydon  wildly entertaining  coogan and brydon  as they proved earlier in winterbottom s brilliant  tristram shandy  a cock and bull story   are a pair of pretty funny guys to spend time with  their riff on  we leave at daybreak   is almost worth the ticket price  the odyssey goes on a bit too long  and i suppose a taste for extra dry british comedy is a requirement  but this trip is well worth one  the movie offers enough good one liners  both comic and ruminative  to hold one s interest  but don t expect much else  
1162,elite_squad_the_enemy_within,when this enemy within settles into key action sequences  such as a stunning nighttime ambush or a daytime battle against fabio  it becomes wildly entertaining  padilha s film offers no easy answers  but the title is a tip off as to where at least his sympathies lie  throttles forward with remarkable aplomb and easily leaves the original in the dust  elite squad is just urgent and complex enough to make it clear violence is more than a matter for academic debate  jammed with cliches but completely engrossing  it resembles a flow chart splattered with blood and spittle  more static and smeary in tone than the finger pointing corrective director cowriter jose padilha intended  padilha s style is so urgent and immediate that you almost feel like you re in the midst of an especially advanced video game  our hero s prominence sets up a stellar conclusion that retroactively questions both the first movie and its substantial audience  it s wagner moura s spotless embodiment of the principled brazilian man for whom aggression and being coincide that renders the film such an immersive experience  
1163,uncle_boonmee,what would pass for longueurs in another director s movie become commands for rumination here  
1164,beats_rhymes_and_life_the_travels_of_a_tribe_called_quest,this authorized documentary is more of a celebration of the legendary queens quartet than a serious exploration of their art  but considering how brilliant they were at their peak  it s hard to disagree with the general sentiment  despite accusations of nearly succumbing to spotlighting beefs over beats  the film comes off as an honest representation of a great group that s not to be forgotten  thanks to a particularly even handed job by director michael rapaport  the story emerges as compelling  even for non fans in the audience  there s nothing new about the bickering between lead rappers q tip and phife  or their redundant breakup and reunion cycle  it helps that these lyricists are our key narrators  so at least they add wit and humour to their brief history  there are scenes toward the end of the movie that hint at a fuzzier tomorrow for tribe  but you leave appreciating the music as it was  not hoping for anything else  the emotional honesty rapaport captures on screen comes off as real  a cut above standard issue behind the music drama in terms of believability  even those who never joined the cult of a tribe called quest will find this clear eyed chronicle of their career irresistible  rapaport  in his feature directorial debut  does an admirable job recounting the group s formation and dissecting its dissolution   beats  rhymes   life  is a must for hip hop heads  others will either be won over or left wondering what all the fuss is about  but unlike so many movies about the rise and fall of successful bands  this one manages to capture the thrill of discovery that a tribe called quest enjoyed  at least in their early years  
1165,cedar_rapids_2010,its breezy charm papers over narrative cracks and minor annoyances  
1166,the_ides_of_march,morris and meyers may have treated stearns as disposable  but the filmmakers shouldn t have  and we as viewers shouldn t have to either  while the eventual awful revelations might shock liberals who believe the absurdly sunny west wing to be a documentary  anybody with a shard of cynicism in their heart will react with an unsurprised shrug  it has disdain for the process  showing the inherent hypocrisy living inside the political system and the corruptive influence it can have on the lives and mores of seeming innocents caught up within its withering whirlpools of self aggrandizement  a marvellously stable thriller that squeezes you so expertly you react in all the ways it wants  you could set your watch by the ides of march  george clooney s sleek potboiler about soured idealism  spin and dirty secrets  a dark drama that gleams with pure quality  the world of politics provides all the drama and satiric fodder any filmmaker could ask for  and even though the public has shown indifference to such movies in recent years  hollywood keeps making them    the ides of march has star power on its side  with clooney and gosling in the leads  but even if people are attracted to theaters by their presence they re not likely to leave feeling satisfied    as for clooney  when he steps from behind the camera  his candidate exudes an easy  judicious authority  this is intelligent filmmaking  and a provocative moral fable  it may not be perfect  but it stands as one of the better  most realistic movies about the way we elect our leaders  from the film s ideological vantage point  moderate democrats are machiavellian devils  and republicans are an inconceivable evil looming on a distant horizon  like the white walkers in game of thrones  just about every other scene in the film is a simple pleasure unto itself between the equally confident writing  direction and performances  clooney does a good job opening up the ideas willimon first explored onstage  but the result is still a pessimistic truth so universally acknowledged that it doesn t bear repeating  however stylishly  it s great fun for us to see an entertaining movie we can watch without guilt  
1167,rise_of_the_planet_of_the_apes,distinguishes itself from other ill conceived reboots in general  and from tim burton s disastrous 2001 remake in particular  by looking with fresh  simian eyes at its core conflict between human and primates  caesar then gets bigger and crankier  he must choose  as a final career option  between maximum security retirement or world changing multi ape mayhem atop the golden gate bridge  take a guess  show me some ape stuff that s new and surprising  a well crafted b movie with astonishingly effective motion capture cgi technology  director rupert wyatt wisely keeps the scenes busy and the momentum building so that you would barely notice all the logistical nonsense on screen  
1168,1209933-puss_in_boots,puss in boots kind of surprised me  far more witty then i expected it to be  nicely animated and featuring a charming story of forgiveness and redemption that belies its shrek inspired fractured fairy tale roots  this movie more than won me over  what kids will get from it is plenty of fairly outrageous but not often witty fun with fairytale elements blended into a kind of latterday spaghetti western  for the rest of us  there is plenty of nice visual detail  this western parodying cat with too many names is closer to rango than to anything from the kingdom of far far away  like most kittens  it s not always perfectly behaved  but at least this new puss adventure doesn t have you reaching for the cinematic spray bottle  puss in boots prances along on three basic truths  one  cats are funny  two  vain spanish cats in high heeled musketeer boots are even funnier  lastly  booted  vain spanish cats voiced by a breathy antonio banderas are flat out hilarious  an almost purr fect little film that even a dog owner can enjoy  
1169,super_8,it s a by the numbers blockbuster  but one with a key element that s missing from most of the big budget bloatfests crowding each other for space on the marquee every summer  heart  while it may not achieve the level of pop culture canonization as the spielberg films it invokes  super 8 should inspire many to use their camera phones for something more creative than a profile pic  a spielberg pastiche of uncanny precision and sublime pointlessness  super 8 is the most intensely spielbergian film you ll ever see that steven spielberg didn t actually direct himself  and it s early spielberg  what keeps us enthralled is its nostalgic sensibility  partly for the time but mostly for its old school film making values  wears off like a warm childhood memory  the geekery has charm  but is a little self conscious and just occasionally  this movie resembles an open ended  rambling drama serial that gets a little  well  lost  a diverting but rather pointless affair  undermined by its obsessive and clinical commitment to recreating past glories  spielberg and abrams are the unwitting targets of their own irony  abrams is great at keeping his balls in the air  but when it comes time to catch them  he s all thumbs  regrettably  writer director jj abrams  star trek  mission impossible iii  co creator of tv series lost  is better here at building suspense than paying it off  a piece that satisfies what we ve been craving ever since the viral campaign began  yet one that goes in directions we d never expect and that blend is what makes it such a special film  
1170,tinker_tailor_soldier_spy,just watching gary oldman and his trenchcoated brethren march down the damp  ill lit streets of cold war london is enough to make you shiver  
1171,armadillo_2010,lets the soldiers tell their stories by the way they live day to day during their tour of duty  when the bombs go off and the bullets start flying  metz and his cameraman provide a real life vision of what a hurt locker is really all about  the movie s strength and audacity comes from the danish soldiers  who confront civilians with wariness or bluntness  exalt in their victories and hesitantly exhibit fear in each others  company  a mesmerizing  beautiful and terrifying documentary that can stand among the greatest war movies ever made  facile documentaries like this one  no matter how sincere their intentions may be  don t help the case  it s a sickening but stunning portrait of combat that looks past notions of bravery or brutality  guilt or innocence  to bear witness to a thoroughly besieged humanity  while much of armadillo echoes last year s restrepo  the unprecedented access of director janus metz and cameraman lars skree reveals the alternating waves of frontline tedium and terror with fresh immediacy  it took great courage for janus metz and lars skree to make armadillo   first to shoot it under such conditions and then to present the material in this non judgmental manner  janus metz s project is certain to prove far more revelatory to his fellow countrymen than it will when it makes its stateside debut  a remarkable documentary that was filmed in life threateningly dangerous circumstances and brings military conflict to nerve shredding  horribly intimate life  whether or not these elements can be taken together in good taste is for the viewer to decide  but the experience of watching armadillo is a gut wrenching and memorable one  metz calculates perfectly the distance to keep from his material  not too close  not too far  the exact point in space where compassion can merge with critique  what metz gives us is an unusually intimate portrait of the cycle of arrival  survival and departure experienced by soldiers on a six month tour of duty  
1172,beginners,a quietly moving  delicately mounted romantic drama that touches the heart with resorting to melodrama or an over reliance on conflict  it s one of those movies i can t be sure you ll be tempted by  but i m certain that if you are  you ll like it very much  an oddly charming concoction  wwhile there s plenty of melancholia  there is also sweet wonder and celebration in writer director mike mills  semiautobiographical tale of a straight son coming to terms with his own love s possibilities after his father comes out of the closet  
1173,meeks_cutoff,a film ponderously slow in pace yet kinetically charged with insight  starkly realistic yet allegorical too  psychologically astute yet politically resonant  
1174,terri_2011,whereas jacobs pre has been most concerned for the past four decades with using cinema as an instrument for exploring the mechanics and boundaries of visual perception  jacobs fils is less a mad scientist than a misfit bard  lest you think that you ve already seen every possible variation on the outsider nerd story  terri keeps plenty of surprises up its pit stained sleeves  its charms feel somewhat calculated  but this reflective tale of outsider solitude has enough humor and poignancy to win admirers

1179,carancho,some movies are described as explosive  this is positively eardrum perforating  the statistic that 8 000 argentinians die in traffic accidents every year gives his film a context  but trapero didn t need to work quite so hard to prove it  the argentinean actor ricardo darn  the secret in their eyes  has an almost bogart like gift for playing world weary rotters with a core of nobility  at heart an unlovely love story illuminated by sudden flares of violence  the film reeks of hopelessness and moral destitution  offering its lovers few means of escape  
1180,my_week_with_marilyn,curtis occasionally takes his characters out of pinewood  but they re never really set free  either in physical or emotional terms  the magic on set moments meant to make marilyn s inconstancy worthwhile don t come off as such  which leaves us to wonder just why anyone would put up with her

1184,even_the_rain,this ambitious  cycloramic narrative about a spanish film crew attempting to mount a revisionist history of christopher columbus amid citizen unrest in bolivia is so potent it nearly succeeds even as a vacuum sits squarely at its center  
1185,viva_riva,the titular exclamation point promises exuberant fun that the movie delivers only in spots  this insight into the aimless hedonism of young punks could be cutting  but the film doesn t dig beneath riva s jack the lad charisma  you ll need some patience to wrangle with this conflicted beast  but it s never dull  
1186,tucker_and_dale_vs_evil,this movie is certifiably insane  that s a given  but it s also extremely witty  has far more intelligence than you might originally expect and has a grand time exploding clich s and playing with an audience s expectations  here s something you don t see every day  a genial  politically correct splatter comedy  clever horror comedy hybrid of the kind that sam raimi used to make and that so many have tried to produce in recent years but have fallen remarkably flat  there s nothing flat about this clever genre flick  for the right audience  it s pretty great  students of the little movie glossary may find it funny how carefully  tucker and dale  works its way through upended cliches  it s time we all toss our nine bucks into the proverbial woodchipper  don t ask me what proverb  and spit out enough money to make tucker   dale and other truly deserving  truly funny indie flicks a blazing success  this is one of those rare genre comedies that near perfectly balances its blend of grue  guffaws  and gag reflexes  there s even a message under all the body parts  people are individuals  not just easy regional stereotypes  essentially a student film offering nothing but absurdly contrived coincidence  we see a script and some underexposed actors who were lucky to find each other  uses its reversal of the standard roles in rural horror to fantastic comedic effect  a droll sendup of the killer in the swamp genre that gets funnier as it rolls along  relying mostly on a single gimmick  the slasher comedy presents a high degree of difficulty for both the director and actors  their earnest efforts keep the repetition from becoming ponderous  a farce of misunderstanding first  body count nightmare second and at nearly all times a refreshingly upending horror comedy bromance  if you re seeing this as the midnight movie it s destined to best be experienced as  you could safely drift off after the 45 minute mark    it s a sometimes hilarious send up of slasher movies that buries a surprising amount of sweetness under buckets of gore

1188,circumstance,keshavarz uses a trowel to feed us her ideas about living under a repressive regime when all you required was a teaspoon  but she has enough promise to keep you curious for her next offering   if she can just get a lighter grip on the ladle  offers an intoxicating peek into a society where skinny dipping at dawn can be a revolutionary act  it s languorously filmed and insightful on life in tehran but let down by an erratic plot turn  the final scenes  dominated to a large extent by the stunning open book grace of boosheri  took my breath away  and by the time the film was over i was somewhat awestruck by just how deeply the story being told affected me  we never doubt the sincerity of the emotions on display  or of the foretaste circumstance provides of a society on the brink of radical change  this impressive debut feature generates plenty of erotic heat  and nikohl boosheri  in her first screen role  gives a captivating performance as the sensually awakened heroine  offers an inside look at iran in all its cultural complexity  keshavarz has cast mostly newcomers with surprisingly effective results  especially the gorgeous kazemy  whose somber beauty and quiet focus give her character the gravitas she deserves  despite its arty veneer and its ostensibly political edge  circumstance seems more interested in titillation than revelation   circumstance   is a rhapsodic erotic romance that takes place in a cultural prison  and it pulses with a defiance that would be mischievous if it weren t so rip roaringly angry  
1189,mysteries_of_lisbon,the production design and costumes are immaculate  while ruiz s camera glides around soires  ducks under tables and peers from behind curtains  this isn t one of those epics that uses length as a bludgeon  rather than sweep  the movie spirals  twisting its viewpoint to reveal tales within tales

1194,thor,witty  charming and very current  the big screen adaptation of thor is sure to catapult its star chris hemsworth  whose wife  elsa pataky  ironically stars in fast five  to leading man status  let s hope branagh was well compensated  at least  to quote his favorite author  no profit grows where is no pleasure taken  director kenneth branagh  for all the shakespearean fruitiness he imbues into some of his a list performers  never forgets that thor is ultimately an fx driven film designed to sell popcorn  there is pleasure to be plundered from some of the battle scenes  especially when thor is confronting ice monsters with blood red eyes  and from the culture clash that resounds when he descends to present day earth    thor is such a joyless affair that writing even this much about it is nearly as exhausting as sitting through the movie  a merely adequate introductory saga coated in hammy regality by director kenneth branagh  thor continues the trend of weakly jumpstarting a franchise based on a marvel comic with an instantly forgettable origin story  a giant notch up is hiddleston  who d make a good edmund in king lear  you register the chip on his shoulder rather than the villainy  i approached this new lollapalooza with an open mind that was quickly addled by loads of back story and front story and an ear splitting avalanche of special effects  nothing against the buff  blond god of thunder  but thor just doesn t have a built in wow factor among the nongeek brigade  the visuals are breathtaking without it  all swirling cosmic nebulae and mythic cityscapes of the norse god capital asgard  thor seems to have little more on its mind than winning the first weekend and making its money back overseas  which it probably  predictably  will  
1195,the_skin_i_live_in,even a second level almodovar is better than most other people  few filmmakers are more assured or alluring  even when we fear we re following a monster  only someone as talented as almod var could have mixed such elements without blowing up an entire movie

1201,skyfall,britain is quite diverse right now  feel free to reflect that anytime  mr  bond  it achieves an effective balance between the ever escalating action sequences that each successive bond picture apparently demands  fresh use of charismatic talent  and nods to the legacy a bond film should feature a menacing villain who s also just a touch daffy  javier bardem has more fun than anybody else onscreen as a rogue agent with a mommy complex and a come hither leer  skyfall easily moves into the top 5 of bond movies ever  maybe even the top 3 with from russia with love and casino royale  this latest installment  which firmly cements daniel craig as one of the best bonds ever  feels more serious  less gimmicky  more geared towards mature adults  craig has relaxed into bond without losing any steeliness  in sam mendes s first bond movie  dazzlingly photographed by roger deakins  the sequences shot in wintry london and scotland stand out  bond traditions haven t just been updated    they ve been intelligently modified and rethought  giving us the franchise s inherent pleasures in a new package  it s been a long time since i enjoyed a bond movie so much  breathes fresh life into the genre  mendes  approach to action is classical and elegant   no manic editing and blurry unintelligible images here   but what makes the movie special is the attention he pays his actors  its canny blend of ingredients is sure to entertain any audience but i think bond enthusiasts will relish it most  as it draws on our familiarity with the series  many touchstones  great heroes are often enhanced by the villains they face  and such is the situation here  to really work  bond needs great bad guys  silva is bad at its best  
1202,marvels_the_avengers,downey s stark iron man steals the show because the actor is capable of making the tritest dialogue sound wonderfully witty  but the cgi effects are amazing and  despite its length  the film is very enjoyable  this will be loved by genre fans  when all is said and done  but at two hours forty  you may find it numbs your bum  seriously  more attention to character could have made it a lot more fun  and now i have said all that  i believe my poem is done  if we must have these box office behemoths  then at least the writer director  joss whedon  creator of buffy the vampire slayer  is a lively controlling influence  of course it s about one hundred times brighter than transformers and michael bay s imbecilic spinoffs  and should keep multiplexes everywhere in its competent grip  but i didn t love it  after two and a half hours of world threatening chaos and world saving derring do  you leave the theater satisfied  but without so much as a single memorable image  or idea  lingering in your mind  whedon manages all these disparate threads confidently  his script a model of self control and restraint that s far from typical for the genre  ultimately  it all comes back to whedon  his clear vision for each character and how they might be profitably intermingled  his unexpected knack for action choreography  his funny  tender  immaculately constructed script  it s easy to turn nick fury s blind eye to the movie s flaws because at the end of the day the avengers packs big explosions  bigger personalities and hulk sized punch lines  the film is good enough to keep all the marvel comics crazed audiences out there deliriously happy while keeping the rest of us earthbound types in moderate thralldom  a slow start  a single star performance surrounded by indifferent acting and an onslaught of computer effects that range from seen it all in  transformers  to a whole sky full of spectacular stuff in the midtown manhattan climax  
1203,looper,writer director rian johnson establishes himself as an original talent who clearly believes storytelling must prevail

1209,amour_2013,scene after scene is an exquisite masterclass of astonishing acting  
1210,the_invisible_war,what calibre of male personnel is the military attracting  and how will this dysfunction affect its relations with foreign civilian populations  it is a grim picture  tears are not hard evidence  but they are hard to resist as anecdotal testimony  i can hardly wait to see which closet dick will throw open next  i have rarely been more righteously riled up than i was while watching the documentary the invisible war  this travesty has been encouraged by a military culture that blames the victim and a policy directing soldiers to refer complaints to their commanding officer  which typically results in no action or even reprisals against those speaking out  even if you do not see this movie yourself  please encourage any young woman you know who is considering enlistment to watch this movie first  one hearing noted that the victim was dressed provocatively  in her official uniform  if it doesn t make you angry  you re not human  for sheer infuriation value  you can t do much better than kirby dick s quietly scathing documentary on rape in the us military  what happened to these women after the rape often shocks and disturbs them as much as the physical act itself  
1211,monsieur_lazhar_2011,phillipe falardeau  who adapted the play into a screenplay  can t entirely paper over a few niggling loose ends  but overall this disturbing film is very effective indeed  very few films offer a moral grandeur  as well as a political foundation  very few films have such poised and brilliant performances from unknown actors  with a few folds  this story could have made a script for john barrymore  like topaze  or for chaplin  fans of nicolas philibert s immaculate chronicle of the learning curve   tre et avoir  are sure to appreciate the warm lessons of this award winning canadian film  monsieur lazhar remains tight lipped about his private life  but the audience comes to learn about the great human loss and danger of deportation that clouds his life  only the most obstreperous delinquent could fail to be charmed by monsieur lazhar  in which an algerian refugee plays ramshackle mary poppins to the kids at a montreal primary  the film invites comparison with laurent cantet s 2008 film the class  which makes it look tame by comparison  but also dead poets society  which makes it look tough  despite its independent credentials  it feels like a softened remake of a rawer  more compelling story  a timely examination of violence in our society through the eyes of those who can t control it  an oscar nominee at this year s academy awards and for good reason  falardeau s film is moving  smart and sensitive  terrific stuff  in short  remarkably human  touching  brilliant film that never succumbs to melodrama  finding something truthful in the complex relationship between adults and children forced to grow up too soon  a standard liberal tale about an inspirational teacher gradually deepens into a quiet study of how grief works its way through a community  
1212,the_kid_with_a_bike,the directing by the dardenne brothers reflects their previous work  it wants to be unnoticed either for virtuosity or clumsiness  yet only virtuosos can attain this ideal  there is not a wasted shot in this stripped down  pared back fable  yet  it accrues a deep and lasting power  you won t see many better this year  jean pierre and luc dardenne make great movies with such regularity they can be easy to overlook  but the kid with a bike puts just enough spin on the dardennes  formula to let you feel their worth anew  cyril is one of the most inspiringly resilient  self aware young characters to arrive on screen in recent memory    hunched over the handlebars  the boy s body seems to carve a hole in the wind  and we watch as this unhappy  rejected child makes some terrible choices  some of which make us want to look away  you wouldn t exactly call the kid with a bike a feel good movie  but by the end it certainly invites the viewer to be hopeful about human nature  another gem from the boys  without diminishing the boy s intensity or making him in any way ingratiating  the dardennes take us into his mind  and we begin to appreciate not only his predicament but his resiliency  young thomas doret fills the role with natural sincerity and focus  and not a second that seems contrived  makes a powerful statement about the plight of unwanted children  but it also incorporates elements of melodrama  film noir  and even the fairy tale that engage our empathy and confirm the dardennes  great compassion  as the movie progressed  the dardenne brothers unwavering and unflinching eye kept me captivated  a wonderfully human and humane story about one of those lost and found children who tend to slip through society s not so safe safety nets

1216,this_is_not_a_film_2011,truly and defiantly extraordinary in its own quiet way  what it all adds up to is a ruefully witty essay on what does or does not constitute cinema  jean luc godard grapples endlessly  some would say incomprehensibly  with these debates  but panahi s invigorating directness cuts to the chase  a film which only reveals its true colours after intense contemplation  
1217,lincoln_2011,its narrative swoop largely takes the legislative detail in its stride  plus the star is daniel day lewis  which is always a thing  he is not so much an actor  more a shape shifter  lincoln is an engrossing and even stirring civics lesson that tries  with admirable responsibility if only mixed success  to give voice to black america  against the odds  spielberg makes something genuinely exciting of the backstage wheedling  by stepping into history without fear  favour or any overfamiliar biopic folly  lincoln  handsome  often thrilling  and movingly human  goes into history as a major movie achievement  a rousing  rigorous and morally complex legal procedural more than a trad biopic  and all the better for it  it s the most remarkable movie steven spielberg has made in quite a spell  and one of the things that makes it remarkable is how it fulfills those expectations by simultaneously ignoring and transcending them  lincoln paints a powerful and compelling portrait of the man who has become an icon  we don t need to see more of his life to understand how rare a figure he was   this window is more than sufficient  lincoln offers proof of what magic can happen when an actor falls in love with his character  because as great as day lewis has been in his many parts  he has never seemed quite so smitten  master shape shifter daniel day lewis delivers a monumental portrayal of a man so firmly monumented in our nation s history  the film masterfully captures the dual dilemmas facing the president in the final months of his life  how to bring the war between the states to an end  and how to eradicate slavery  once and for all  lincoln is a stirring reminder that politics can be noble  might there be a lesson here for today s shrill d c  discourse   tis a consummation devoutly to be wished

1219,the_loved_ones_2012,it s a terrifying masterpiece that turns high school drama into a literal dead zone  sean byrne endows his rote slasher material with the kind of blackly comic wit and levity that virtually guarantee its entry into the contemporary midnight movie canon  thanks to mcleavy s incredible performance as the childish  spoiled and evil lola  no matter how horrible things get  you just cannot take your eyes away from the screen  a blood spattered  tongue in cheek horror comedy that features plenty of low rent gore  some extra cheesy lines and some terrific performances  byrne announces his emphatic arrival with this movie  australian horror has another distinctive new voice  byrne s confident feature debut takes the coming of age tropes of john hughes  and adds a hefty dose of campy psychosis  creating a tale of small town adolescent horror where the growing pains really do hurt  
1220,undefeated_2012,the hardened inner city kids here are far more authentic than anything hollywood can offer  and as a result the film has a raw emotional weight that commercial features rarely achieve  
1221,beware_of_mr_baker,a cracking story  buzzily edited  this warts and warts portrait delivers an illuminating insight into recent rock history  don t miss it  bleakly entertaining  beware of mr baker neither eulogises nor patronises its subject  one day  though possibly not soon   baker may take it upon himself to say thanks  it s a broadly forgiving portrait of an impossible  irascible talent  who seems to have treated life much like his instrument  we are always being told that books and movies have to have  sympathetic  lead characters   well  here s a documentary that does very well without one  an interesting character study interspersed with classic rock  jazz and afrobeat clips  nothing more  but certainly nothing less  it s refreshing to watch a music doc  especially one with such intimate access to its subject  in which barely anyone is unreservedly polite about the person in question  ginger baker has been revealed as a major talent  an innovator and an unlikely survivor  and a not very nice guy  although it hits many of the same notes as other recent musical docs  beware of mr  baker nevertheless does a satisfactory job of capturing a restless personality  bulger tries  unconvincingly  to paint baker as a difficult but admirable rebel  the lingering question in the documentary is whether his musical accomplishments were worth the trail of damage  it gives baker his musical props while at the same time demonstrating the film s title is no exaggeration  any movie that starts with the subject assaulting the director  baker smacks plucky first timer jay bulger squarely in the face with his cane  is already ahead of the game  if clapton was god  guess who was the devil  miserable individuals do tend to make for interesting subject matter  and this would be far more of a dry biography without its willfully eccentric lead

1223,mea_maxima_culpa_silence_in_the_house_of_god,it s impossible to leave the cinema without hoping that the papal resignation and the awful events explored here are not unrelated  a kind of unintentional leaving gift for the outgoing pope benedict  though it is not one he is likely to relish  well done and compelling  and at its strongest when focusing on the bravery of these four deaf men who broke the silence  partly an inspiring saga of growing  deaf power  and human resilience  and partly a murky and fragmentary drama about an immense  closed minded bureaucracy with paranoid and conspiratorial tendencies that finds itself unable to adjust to the modern world  gibney s most powerful film since the oscar winning 2007 taxi to the dark side  fearless nonfiction filmmaker alex gibney details a history of horrific abuse by catholic clergy in this tough to watch documentary  primed to deliver a heady dose of outrage via a broad overview of systemic cover ups tracing to the vatican  as well as a specific and heartbreaking case in wisconsin  the film is one sided  of course church officials ignored interview requests  but their version has been around for a couple of millennia anyway  mea maxima culpa only gets messier the more it tries to iris out to a larger indictment  the central tragedy ends up diluted to a fault  i don t speak latin  but i m pretty sure that  mea maxima culpa  translates into   good grief  don t watch this movie without access to some excedrin   no one of true faith will get over maxima mea culpa  alex gibney s latest lacks a certain cinematic depth  but that doesn t take away from its admirable reporting

1228,the_imposter_2012,director bart layton pieces together a story you wouldn t believe if it wasn t true  more than anything it s layton s storytelling acumen that impresses   the movie unfolds like a psychological thriller  and in the second half effects a chilling twist on its own inherent implausibility  you may begin to wonder if you aren t being conned by the movie yourself  the imposter emerges as a brilliantly slippery film that demands brain stretching consideration  astonishing  indeed  british director bart layton has only slightly fictionalised this extraordinary story for his documentary  which is told more as a thriller than a statement of hard fact  when this film was over  i felt as if i had been holding my breath for 99 minutes  it is pure  delicious suspense  think of clint eastwood s changeling and multiply by the power of reality  the year s most fascinating and frightening doc so far  the imposter delves far beneath the hysterical tabloid headlines  it s both preposterous and horrific  and therein lies its powerful  disquieting charm  beverly dollarhide  nicholas s mother  says of the period after her son s disappearance   my main goal in life at that time was not to think   apparently  the filmmakers have taken a cue from her  layton s dazzling film is an exciting  edge of your seat experience superior to any hollywood mystery you re likely to see for a long time   the imposter  becomes more than just a missing persons drama  it hints at something much darker  a real life horror story  the full truth of which may never be known  
1229,marley,marley aficionados will be astonished by the depth and breadth of the documentary  which portrays the musician known as tuff gong as both a fallible man and an untouchable legend  marley is highly watchable  finely crafted legacy preservation   and it s either a white washed sham or awesomely shaded  it wants to show us the man behind the famous dreads  beatific smile and durable songs of love  hope and longing  in this task it succeeds admirably  you ll walk away from this ambitious documentary longing to hear marley s voice again  thank heaven for itunes  and with a deep respect for a man  sprinkled with riffs  concert footage and home videos  the family authorized documentary does what the artist usually did  when in doubt  return to the beat  macdonald supplies some interesting and novel details about the musician s life and art  though the movie s narrative arc and documentary methods are totally predictable  given the legal and logistical constraints on this long delayed project  this lengthy movie is as comprehensive a history as marley s fans could have hoped  but the uninitiated may not catch a fire  even audiences for whom easing up to dutty riddims is not an habitual pursuit will get an intoxicating whiff of reggae s soothing powers from marley    it s hard to imagine audiences who don t know much about the man sticking around for more than a few minutes of this  and they re the ones who need to know about him most of all  it s exhaustive without being exhausting  an eye opening and all encompassing portrait that should go a long way to rescuing him from being a marijuana mascot  kevin macdonald s solid  informative  respectful bio doc is not quite the dazzling  innovative non fiction we might have expected from the oscar winning director of touching the void  stylistically unremarkable  playing it safe with structure  the film is still quietly revelatory

1261,beasts_of_the_southern_wild,the brilliant  original four hankie dystopian family drama from new orleans newcomer benh zeitlin far surpassed any expectations for a scruffy  1 5 million effort from an unknown film collective    the movie s mad gusto is truly infectious  it will not only stir your soul  but also open your mind to the possibility of a real life promised land  what is also extraordinary is that almost all the people we see are actors  so this is not a documentary but a moving enactment by people who are themselves moved  when can we watch it again  it doesn t ultimately make any sense at all and  for me  its charm wasn t enough to sustain the whole ramshackle structure  like a series of dippy postcards sent by an enraptured child from a disaster zone  benh zeitlin s debut feature is part film  part hallucination  a ripe and gamey piece of what you might call apocalyptic southern gothic  ambitious and flawed but sprinting with energy  few american debuts in recent years have announced a talent as singular as that of behn zeitlin  the blazingly gifted director and co writer of beasts of the southern wild  the atmosphere zeitlin develops here is moist with promise and danger  and he moves back and forth between outright fable and pungent reality with an astounding sureness of vision for a first time director  hushpuppy exists fully in whatever moment she happens to find herself in  it s a jaw droppingly good performance from this pint sized  first time actor

1263,21_jump_street_2011,tatum  best known for syrupy romances and action movies  turns out to have crackerjack comic timing and brie larson and dave franco are standouts  miller and lord clearly understand the push and pull and hyper competitiveness that make guy friendships both complex and stupid  
1264,arbitrage,pleasing twists and moral dilemmas abound  we are persuaded to root for miller  even when he is betraying the people he loves best  you ll feel dirty  and well you should after a few hours in this company  an old fashioned treat  gere gets the role he has been suiting up for ever since he was first designer dressed for a murder rap in american gigolo  this isn t very effective as a thriller  though it s a provocative fable about our ambivalent feelings toward financial elites  gere s very good at making robert s compromises seem more human than horrid  he portrays the philanthropic  philandering patriarch with his customary twinkle  straddling the line between celebration and vilification of its nasty protagonist  arbitrage plunges into the world of corporate fraud with chilly detachment  the real standout is tim roth as a streetwise new york city detective who s seen it all and can spot a liar a mile away   arbitrage  becomes far more complex than just dramatized anti corporate polemic  or even a simple fall from grace

1266,the_raid_redemption,hollywood is particularly unsuited to producing sensation cinema these days  because welsh born director gareth evans has an especially good understanding of how to choreograph and stage the fight scenes  this comes across as a viscerally enjoyable experience  
1267,keep_the_lights_on,the movie s elaborately failed closure only makes sense once you understand that the filmmaker s all too human desire for self justification apparently trumped the ruthless self control required to make a work of art  
1268,chronicle,the movie is surprisingly character based  using stock figures from a john hughes high school comedy only to give them all more depth and nuance then you d typically expect for a tale of this sort

1272,the_pirates_band_of_misfits,it s a fun frolic young and old alike should enjoy equally  filled with sights and sounds so richly rewarding one almost has to see it twice to be able to appreciate them all  the wonderful folks at aardman have created another deliriously silly stop motion animation delight  filled with giddy pleasures and so many witty details flying by that you wish for a pause button  the filmmakers have said they are already dreaming up a sequel  they needn t hurry  whatever treasures these pirates have are well buried  frequently funny and layered with humor to suit all ages  to paraphrase a certain man with a certain luxuriant beard  it s only impossible to enjoy if you stop to think about it  pirates are right up there with vampires  werewolves and people saying  lol  out loud on the list of played out pop culture phenomena  but leave it to aardman animation to find the remaining reservoirs of fun in a bunch of seafaring scalawags  young and old alike love a good pirate yarn and the stop motion specialists at aardman animations deliver the goods  this pirate tale is a misguided adventure that doesn t fully set sail  it makes for an experience that  while geared toward younger  more fidgety audiences  has enough humor to keep mom and dad from falling asleep  that the film happens to be in 3 d  with digitized settings and backgrounds  doesn t detract from the timeworn charm of watching blob like characters lurch erratically through harebrained comic pratfalls  pirates is just what audiences have come to expect from aardman  smart  adventure driven comedy with all ages appeal and an affinity for clever sight gags  
1273,seven_psychopaths,self aware stupidity does not equal wit  this is what adaptation might ve looked like had charlie kaufman been hired to pen a flippantly nihilistic wiseguy saga instead of an unfilmable ode to orchids  
1274,the_perks_of_being_a_wallflower,this is boring  and it s partly that believability thing  how many alienated outsiders do you have to gather together before they become insiders  alternatively  they are all so good looking  smart and well heeled  they are winners  surely   like real teenagers  watson and miller convincingly move from glowing objects of desire to comic relief to deeply troubled human beings   i think for a first film this guy who wrote the book and has adapted it for the screen has done a terrific job and i really found these characters sympathetic  even making allowances for a certain amount of hollywood gloss  there s something wrong with a film about misfits where everyone is this good looking and poised  perks seems like the work of a much more experienced director  maintaining fidelity to the source material without sacrificing any cinematic qualities  triggering genuine sentimentality and nostalgia through interaction between sound and image  sensitive teens and their older kin who pine for the  90s may want to take it for a spin on the dance floor  seek out the infinitely superior the myth of the american sleepover for an original and moving take on similar material  teenage wallflowers  past and present alike  will feel tingles of recognition  and pure pleasure  an honest  affection hooking  coming of age drama which proves that there is life beyond hogwarts for emma watson  high school can be hell  but stephen chbosky s engaging new film argues that anyone can get by with a little help from their friends  this somewhat disjointed but refreshingly earnest movie ultimately establishes itself as a charmer  
1275,robot_and_frank,ageing  isolation  broken families  memory and the impact of modern technology are all playfully woven through a smart  comforting narrative that s at once immensely satisfying yet wonderfully unexpected  the film tries to say something coherent about important issues such as the descending darkness of old age but misses the mark with most of them  forget the sci fi trimmings and sentimental pay off   this is a gleefully subversive character study of a charming but unapologetic rogue  an endearing movie about a human and his mechanical new buddy  
1276,la_fee,i personally admired and cringed at about the same time  if you like tati esque japes  francophone clowns abel  gordon and romy should be just up your alley  it s wonderful to be reminded that the film universe is more diverse than the oscars normally suggest   and also that movies can be lightweight entertainments and also deeply strange  for all its brazen goofiness  the fairy is subtly designed to reward careful viewing  the persistent whimsy gets a bit wearisome  but it s hard to dismiss any film so determined to make us happy  when the lovey doveyness turns cloying and the atrophied message mongering creeps in  you wish the threesome knew when to keep their traps shut  while every scene is art directed with zest and innovatively staged  the fairy rarely inspires outright laughter  at least it respects its influences more than does the artist  re employing the tools of jacques tati and jerry lewis  this pleasant fable reclaims artful slapstick with a bliss that s hard to deny  the belgo canadian french trio  who specialize in pantomime and circus style theatrics  have a clownlike knack for finding humor in the everyday  in their third feature  gifted physical comedians abel  gordon and romy gracefully build on their distinctive brand of burlesque humour  
1277,the_turin_horse,a sumptuous masterpiece by one of the greatest moviemakers of all time  astonishingly powerful on its own uncompromising terms  
1278,boy_2012,even the inevitable flaws of the low budget production are winning  showcasing as they do the narrative artistry that makes boy so distinctive amid current factory written studio productions  writer director and co star taika waititi   eagle vs shark   never builds much momentum for his largely uneventful if sometimes inventive story  the use of flipbook animation and exaggerated fantasy sequences entails a certain logic  but these devices run aground on a fairly limited sense of imagination which fails to make up for the story s essential slightness  
1279,bully_2012,tackles this headline heavy topic by mixing moments of raw emotional power with intervals of somewhat suspect manipulation  
1280,neil_young_journeys,demme hasn t stopped seeking out new angles on this old warhorse  and even the odd speck of spittle on the lens cannot obscure the fact young increasingly looks and sounds like one of the all time greats  jonathan demme makes his third concert film with young  including shots practically right up his nostrils  these two world renowned and individualistic artists from the worlds of music and film clearly bask in each other s company  we  the audience  would be fools to respond otherwise  i d say the movie does a fine job of completing the trilogy  but i wouldn t be surprised if demme and young have more in them yet  forget crosby  stills and nash and maybe even crazy horse  jonathan demme might be neil young s ultimate collaborator  the point of this valuable and continuing exercise is intimacy  not nostalgia per se  demme keeps it simple  apart from the occasionally trippy lens move  it s an intimate performance portrait  divided among new material from his 2010 album  le noise  and many of his classics  more casual fans will twist in their chairs uncomfortably  wishing that a roadie would walk up and wipe it off  neil young die hards will cherish the spittle  as great and intimate as live at massey hall 1971 may be  it s not as transportive as this filming of a neil young performance at the venue 30 years later  what s the point of this particular project  why   apart from any marketing concerns   did either artist feel it was essential to capture this concert on film  
1281,polisse_2011,over the film s more than two hour running time we are immersed in the lives of these cops as they attempt both to see justice done and to preserve their sanity  
1282,tabu_2012,few films are this smart about subtly couching their allegorical aspirations within more straightforward narratives  fewer still are able to do so with such energetically inventive virtuoso style  
1283,rundskop_2012,its centre holds  largely because of schoenaerts s capacity to elicit our sympathy despite everything  bullhead becomes dark  minatory and coruscating in ways not light aeons distant from b chner or scorsese  bullhead more than deserves its run at the big screen  so does its star  this dark  vicious film gets a bit muddled at times but the strength of its lead performance and a strong visual palette make it a stark but worthwhile trip  it s one of those films you have to reconstruct in your mind   it  has enough strands of story for an epic tale  but roskam appears more interested in trying to combine genres that don t easily cohere  bullhead proves that you can make an underworld movie pumped up with pretension  relentless from beginning to end  the dialogue fully loaded with intricate details and the film in general oozing with high stakes and suspense  i hope we ll be getting another chance to watch matthias schoenaerts  work in the near future    as huge as he is in this role  i suspect there s plenty more to see  a goodfellas set among the hormone mafia may not sound like a great movie  but roskam subtly steers it toward intense and agonizing character study  with the bovine supplement angle raising the stakes and dredging up the past  starts out like a thriller and turns into a disturbing tragedy in an unlikely and unexpected key  
1284,middle_of_nowhere,though writer director ava duvernay avoids any and all clich  right up until the closing titles  i have no qualms ending this review with one  i wholeheartedly look forward to her next project  
1285,chico_and_rita,it s entertaining to watch  and i enjoyed the way they slipped in such real life figures as dizzy gillespie beside the fictional leads  this is the kind of sophisticated storytelling you rarely get even in live action movies any more  full of unexpected turns and unruly human complications  
1286,miss_bala_2011,naranjo is unflinching in his determination not to serve up mindless entertainment  naranjo offers a grim subject with neither flash nor sentiment  it is a sober film done with style  this strange and eerie noir is more a collection of knockout scenes than a fully realized story  it s an adventure story that could be called a contemporary picaresque if it weren t so deadly serious  and might be called fantastical if it weren t loosely based on a true story of a former miss hispanic america  an urgent dispatch from the sidelines of the drug war that consumes our southern neighbor  
1287,the_well_diggers_daughter,even as you wish the material had been reshaped into something riskier  you may find yourself appreciating the sincerity and unshowy workmanship that went into the movie  doesn t give us reason to assume that what we don t see is much more scandalous than what we do  
1288,the_impossible_2012,a heart wrenchingly tense survival drama based on  an incredible true story  of a far more  homely  looking spanish family  this is a cut above 1990s eco disaster movies such as dante s peak  the tsunami sequence is amazing  right up there with the one clint eastwood staged in hereafter  unlike some films that have become critics  darlings   the impossible  has no pretensions  it isn t edgy and i don t think it has a hidden subtext  naomi watts gives one of her finest  most physically commanding turns  although it s ostensibly based on true events  the impossible is not so much an inspiring tale of survival as it is an action flick  an intense and compelling family melodrama from spanish director juan antonio bayona that sets a new standard for disaster cinema  perhaps jaws and open water are the only other movie experiences that might engender more fear of the sea  the tsunami comes to life more vividly than the characters  though watts and young holland  as her son  deliver strong performances  an earnest  extremely grueling  prodigiously crafted true life drama that takes one of the worst natural disasters in recorded history and reduces it to a bad day at club med  
1289,your_sisters_sister,it certainly shows that fine films don t need big budgets  capturing some sweet lightning in an arresting bottle indeed  
1290,de_rouille_et_dos_2012,an emotionally gripping if slightly meandering drama marked by two powerful lead performances  though st phanie s legs are removed from sight through the wonders of digital film effects  the character will remain in your consciousness like a phantom limb  
1291,sleepwalk_with_me,this self deprecating comedy would make both larry david and louis c k  proud  however  there s something ultimately unsatisfying about the experience of listening to stand up comedian mike birbiglia tell the true story of his inability to marry his longtime girlfriend  played by the far too hot to be with him lauren ambrose   the film acts as both a diary of a sidewinding comic stylist finding his style  almost by accident  and a reminder to all post collegiate boyfriends and girlfriends that  ok  probably isn t good enough for either party  i liked sleepwalk with me just not nearly as much as i would ve liked to have liked it  this sharp romantic comedy began as a one man show  and you can tell  the hero s voice over narration wraps around the entire movie  and the scenes are mainly verbal  sleepwalk with me is never anything less than awfully likable  but i so wanted it to be more  it all adds up to a fine  funny exercise in disheveled self deprecation  a self portrait of a guy who can t control a major portion of his life  birbiglia proves to be as engaging a presence on the screen as he has been all these years onstage and over the radio waves  the semi autobiographical tale is appealingly low key and alternately funny and melancholy  informed by birbiglia s casual delivery   sleepwalk with me  traps birbiglia inside his own head  he desperately needs a movie or cable series that wakes him up and sets his material loose on the outside world  
1292,snabba_cash_2012,there s plenty here to show why director daniel espinosa caught hollywood s eye  even if this pre safe house crime drama holds few surprises

1297,declaration_of_war,though it s certainly moving  it suffers from a frantically overproduced desperation to hold what the filmmakers seem to fear will be our wavering attention  
1298,the_big_picture_2012, the big picture  ends perhaps a bit too ambiguously  but there s something refreshing about its faith in the moviegoer s intelligence  director eric lartigau tells the story slowly  less interested in suspense than in character  a dark little fable  the story of two separate roads that briefly intersect   and what happens when a man suddenly jumps from one mapped journey to the other  the movie has the intense psychological focus of the late claude chabrol  if not chabrol s graceful camerawork  if some of the plot details defy credibility  romain duris s electrifying performance makes you overlook any inconsistencies  as his likable character becomes a man on the run barely able to stifle his panic  this existential thriller is about a person who seeks personal freedom by becoming somebody else  even  duris  can t fully salvage a last act that clumsily tries to sell the notion that white knight altruism is the ultimate creative satisfaction  the direction from eric lartigau keeps things moving along fast and furious  preposterous it may be  the movie is carried off with some style  a few plot holes hold back what is otherwise a well cast and compelling picture  
1299,detropia_2012,a fascinating portrait of a 21st century post industrial hellscape  detropia s filmmakers stay out of the picture  hanging back to allow the viewer to absorb the meaning of detroit s fate  it is even more complex than we thought  rachel grady and heidi ewing  oscar nominated for their earlier jesus camp  aim a compassionate and artful lens in their new documentary detropia  finding signs of life in the ruined city  city services are shutting down  schools are closing  houses are being demo d by the thousands   like lights being turned out one by one   detropia  powerfully captures a city fighting not to go dark  just as the film finds an aesthetic in its dilapidated setting  the city s residents find hope in a desperate place  a place that once represented hope itself  via beautiful cinematography  the film wanders the city  contrasting a new automaker s towers with abandoned hotels  derelict theaters  ruined houses and people walking through the snow down the middle of streets because there s no traffic  grady and ewing are exceptionally skilled and sensitive visual storytellers  adroit at recognizing decisive moments and smart enough to let viewers make of them what they will  moving from union hall to town hall  from brutal salary negotiations to contentious plans to create urban farms out of concrete wasteland  the film listens and moves on  imagine if frederick wiseman and david lynch had a bastard child  and you ll get a sense of the movie s off kilter aesthetic  a potent and pointed mix of firsthand observation and surreal flights of fancy  detropia seems to be looking for answers  but the ones it finds are too close to the surface to be satisfying  a potent snapshot of a potential future for many american cities  
1300,12_years_a_slave,director mcqueen  drawing on the visual aesthetic of his previous works shame and hunger  never shies away from frames that capture the ways that beauty exists in the most painful situations  12 years a slave is  like the trial  a trapdoor over the abyss  although less abrupt than kafka s novel  the movie wastes little time before plunging its viewer into a nightmare of dehumanization  add the visionary direction by steve mcqueen  the british turner prize winning artist turned film maker  hunger  shame  and you have an out and out stunner  a significant  necessary piece of work  one that stays with you long after you rise out of your theater seat  movies can do a great many things   they can make us laugh  or incite our heroism  or frighten us  or make us cry   12 years a slave  makes us feel  deeply and urgently  mcqueen depicts the horrific experiences of solomon northup  the free man kidnapped and sold into slavery  in utterly unflinching fashion  the film s strength lies in its frankness and avoidance of either sentimentality or quentin tarantino style irony  in its own saintly manner  it s as exploitative as anything critics accused django unchained of being  minus tarantino s eye for idiosyncrasy and sense of humor  you will recoil  you will flinch  you will say to yourself   oh no  not again   but the story will seize you with such a visceral power you will be rooted to the spot  i know i was and i m not easy to root  ejiofor proves himself a master of physical understatement  the clench of his teeth and slightest parting of the lips speaking volumes  the whole film breathes with reality  even while the bayou landscapes are infernalised  surrealised  by a terrible beauty of vision

1309,all_is_lost_2013,a vital  exciting piece of work from mr  redford  an actor whom you d have been forgiven for counting out by now  chandor has produced a minimalist gem  the film attains an operatic grandeur in its closing moments  and surprisingly earns it  chandor s intensely physical  experiential work has brought us right up to the perilous edge between life and death  gravity s great weakness was the unnecessarily abundant corny dialogue  all is lost is makes no such compromises  the utter solitude is almost vertiginous  there s something powerful lurking in the deep  a triumph of pure cinema and wonderful visual storytelling from chandor  who must now be considered the real deal  while redford is sublime in what could well be the performance of his career  even redford bailing water for 106 minutes can be a bit much  five minutes alone with him in all is lost will make you feel like a chump for ever suspecting  redford  was done for  the charisma never went away  it s only aged into a very fine vintage  indeed  we get the predictable plot points   storms  sharks  close calls with passing ships   but it feels like a uniquely handmade artifact  as a solo sailor on a hostile sea  robert redford doesn t so much play to the camera  as tolerate it  showing that  even at 77  he s so much more than a pretty face  a buttery voice and an athletic physique  the movie is rigorous  serious and well crafted  with redford holding the screen using only his economical emotional reactions and physical presence

1311,wadjda_2013,though people will talk about how it breaks boundaries and how pioneering it is  that s not what you most need to know  what you most need to know is that it s fascinating  involving  moving  an entirely excellent film in its own right  determinedly non preachy  non bitter and rapturously uplifting  a moving film that is punctuated by two heartening debut performances wadjda never stops to second guess itself in its intent or declaration  the overall pro freedom message comes through loud and clear  rhetorically speaking  the trick of using childish innocence to reveal adult hypocrisy is virtually foolproof  haifaa al mansour s debut merits recognition for its fresh feeling take on the trope whereby the travails of a child protagonist mirror those of a wider society   wadjda  earns extra points just for being what it is  who knew that  in a country that famously frowns on women driving cars  some are even allowed to make movies  this delightful debut feature by a saudi woman named haifaa al mansour uses a bicycle as a metaphor for freedom within a social circumference  a sweet little film about the human spirit  about want and energy and determination against unfair odds  in saudi filmmaker haifaa al mansour s winsome wonder wadjda  a young girl s aspirations provide an intimate glimpse into the possibilities and limitations of a cloaked culture  al mansour seems out to make a movie that works in america  which is likely a savvy move  since it seems unlikely she s going to get much traction back home  
1312,dallas_buyers_club_2013,though jean marc valle s direction is sometimes indistinct  it does allow the actors to come off more inhibited in their performances and each scene is that much more authentic  despite the cadaverous appearance of its lead actor  dallas buyers club wants to be pretty  too  presenting a tidy  uplifting history of the years when unconscionable inaction and prejudice toward those with aids were a matter of federal policy  what makes the film so special is its sense of defiance and its scabrous humour  mcconaughey and leto drill down to the roots of their characters  it calls to mind that advice for actors playing drunk  you do it like you re emphatically sober  neither man plays the disease  they play instead the rage to live  terrific performances by matthew mcconaughey and jared leto elevate this socio medical drama out of the realms of the ordinary into something quietly remarkable  for all its occasional compromises  dallas buyers club shakes off potential disease of the month tv movie status and succeeds at an uncomplicated emotional level  it would be a tv problem of the week movie without mcconaughey s skill in combining intelligence with pizzazz  a calculated prestige picture that never bothers to ask broader questions about the aids epidemic  the aids epidemic was not a happy ending story  but it was certainly a test of the human spirit  ron woodroof passed that test  dallas buyers club is an indelible story about one man s unwillingness to go gently into that good night  and the personal growth he experiences along the way  
1313,zero_dark_thirty,when it comes to establishing and maintaining tension  there wasn t a better american genre picture released this year  refrain from viewing it as historical record and you won t leave disappointed  this doesn t zip along in the manner of typical hollywood entertainment but it s memorable cinema with a finale that will stay with you long after viewing  if you like world war ii films  you ll enjoy this  so overwhelming is the momentum that it proves possible to live with the intelligence that the protagonist is complicit in ground level fascism  we get all imaginable views of the witchy pentacle that is covert us military politics  it haunts and lingers long after the lights go up  in kathryn bigelow s masterful thriller  the manhunt for osama bin laden is the ultimate no win scenario  a battle neither side can afford to lose with a prize that may not be worth the fight  chastain makes maya as vivid as a bloodshot eye  her porcelain skin  delicate features and feminine attire belie the steel within  there is admirably little fat on its bones  no love interests  no backstories  no b plot about maya s childhood  zero dark thirty is as ruthlessly  relentlessly single minded as she is about the hunt for bin laden  no doubt zero dark thirty serves a function by airing america s dirty laundry about detainee and torture programs  but in its wake  there s a crying need for a compassionate coming home to counter its brutal deer hunter  while  zero dark thirty  may offer political and moral arguing points aplenty  as well as vicarious thrills as a film it s simply too much of a passable thing  
1314,blackfish_2013,a troubling expos of sea world s hazardous entertainment trade  blackfish is a heartbreaking documentary  forensically constructed by gabriella cowperthwaite  about the extreme psychological distress of killer whales kept in captivity and used to entertain crowds at venues such as seaworld in orlando  there are few movies that can change the way you see the world in 83 minutes  if blackfish is seen by enough people  it has the power to affect attendance at seaworld  depressingly unsurprising  informative  earnest  but less than briskly paced  its ultimate message is clear  killer whales belong with their families in their natural habitat  not performing for audiences  after listening to this film s many impassioned voices  it s hard to argue  blackfish marries biography  activism and psycho thriller into a pleasing cinematic shape  starting with a single whale and the trainers who worked with him  cruelty begets cruelty and whales don t belong in the circus  it not only delivers astonishing  suspenseful footage that makes it a legitimate thriller  but also serves up thoughtful meditations about using wild animals for our own entertainment  it s hard to imagine anyone coming out of this movie and not swearing off the next vacation trip to orlando  san antonio or san diego  unfortunately  this feels like a ten minute news segment blown up to theatrical proportions  while cowperthwaite s film opens with a simple question about the behavior of a single killer whale  it ends up mounting a persuasive ethical argument against keeping orcas in captivity  
1315,enough_said_2013,enough said  which is set in a los angeles so blandly lit that it barely seems to be playing itself  is a movie that seems made to be watched on on demand  or on an airplane   helping anchor affairs  though  is the bear like gandolfini  who brings charm and gravitas to a movie that might otherwise have seemed very superficial  a typically astute and funny reading of the foibles of human relationships  spiced up with a forgivably contrived comedic plot twist  some films are a cold shower  others a warm bath  enough said is mainly a warm bath but bracing morality gives the romantic comedy an anchor in common relationship reality  in the terse space film provides  holofcener capturing her characters deftly  we know their fears  needs  lonesomeness  we trust the cars they drive  the food they eat  the rooms they keep tidy  or not  the easy chemistry between louis dreyfus and gandolfini is wonderfully charming   you re rooting for them even as the falsehoods pile up and the poison begins to flow  the jarring shifts between effective drama and failed humor make watching enough said a bumpy and sometimes frustrating journey  for all of us who ve been waiting way too long for a smart  funny  snappy romantic comedy for grown ups   here it is  holofcener delivers her most confident character comedy to date   a work of deceptively informal mastery   and gandolfini s gentle performance just about breaks your heart

1318,the_hunger_games_catching_fire,it s mainstream entertainment  but it succeeds at being riveting and deeply unsettling mainstream entertainment that casts a critical light on our current systems  vivid  visceral filmmaking  twisty and entertaining  with startlingly good turns by jennifer lawrence and philip seymour hoffman  the movies  gratefully  violently counteract any attempt we might make to see them as fun escapism  gary ross did the hype justice by kicking off the series with a highly effective adaptation and now francis lawrence builds upon that success by taking the budget boost and funneling it into top talent  stunning visuals and an all consuming experience  it is heartening to find a teen oriented movie franchise as gritty as the hunger games  even so  catching fire remains contradictory  caught in some nether world between nightmarish political allegory and adolescent escapism  this is empire strikes back stuff  it has that second star wars movie s kick of confidence  director francis lawrence s film runs nearly two and a half hours but it concludes so abruptly and tantalizingly  it leaves you wanting more  like katniss  lawrence has become bigger than the games themselves  something that makes her very powerful  very dangerous and rather inspirational  this follow up to the 2012 hit based on suzanne collins  novel  represents commendable storytelling that ought to please the book s many fans now the violence is not merely physical  but existential  far from having won her freedom as promised  katniss is now imprisoned in a false public narrative supporter of the capitol  lover of peeta from which she may never escape  the one truly fresh invention and the one that matters most is katniss herself  with each on screen chapter  the poor girl from district 12 continues to fulfill her destiny as an inspiration and a rebel fighter  though some of the chases and escapes are thrillingly filmed  this last section of the film feels indistinguishable from plenty of other video game style avoid the obstacle action climaxes  the grand climax  whose elements include a long piece of wire  a lightning bolt  and an electronic force field  is an incoherent  rapid blur that will send the audience scurrying back to the book to find out what s supposed to be going on

1323,more_than_honey,for patient science minded kids and adults  it should find the sweet spot between environmental advocacy and visual pleasure  the movie compensates for its murkier sections with a poignant outlook  it s pretty clear that imhoof is not a fan of us industrial scale farming but rather than shove angry stats such as  80 per cent of plants rely on bee pollination  in your face  he prefers to fascinate viewers  markus imhoof s bee documentary is so stuffed with surreal tableaux it makes your head spin  it is the elegance of its images that sets it apart from previous doomed bee documentaries  the footage of individual animals going about their business is a sight to behold  eye popping photography should draw viewers to this thoughtful  revealing doc  an interesting  and interestingly laidback film  an almost restful look at honeybees and the way they are kept and cultivated across the world  summer s blitz of apocalypse movies has nothing on this bee doc  informative and occasionally scary  oblique narrative aside  you can t beat the film s eye popping visuals  what s really frightening about honey isn t what a hive of angry bees might do to us  but what we ve done to them  imhoof s film is remarkable in its close up photography  the bees loom large  like creatures from some mutant planet  dangle together in a delicate chain  and fill the air  floating like unusually vivid dust specks  without any preachiness  this magically beautiful film urges us to take better care of the bees  and honor the irreplaceable things that they do for us  as a nature doc  more than honey rivals such acclaimed forebears as winged migration and microcosmos  though it s working with a more limited scope  visually if you ve seen one honeybee  you ve seen  em all

1326,frozen_2013,i felt like frozen was a mixed bag  not as bad as i feared it would be  but not as fun to watch as tangled or as subversive as brave  the songs aren t good enough to stick in your head and the characters aren t good enough to be iconic  but frozen is pleasant enough  may it have a long life on abc family  clogging up your weekend tv holiday schedule for years to come   frozen  feels like it s breaking new ground in telling a story where the women are actually in control  and where the clichs of their narratives are turned inside out  almost as a sly commentary on what has come before  the animation is simply superb  ice has never looked so good  except as the real thing  technical precision and innovation is expected nowadays in computer animation but frozen combines that with a gorgeously rich design  disney has another hit in its repertoire with this heartfelt story of sisterly love and one of the few films released in 3 d this year that splendidly incorporates the technology into the plot line  frozen reminds you how many animated films rely more on inside jokes  it s modern without being hip  earnest with being sappy  has everything you want for christmas  belting songs  soaring hearts  snappy jokes and an inspirational reworking of the traditional happy ending  the glitz will satisfy militantly feminine sprogs  but is completely at odds with elsa s gutsy character and frozen s pioneering message  glorious family entertainment  a very decent seasonal disney feature which amply refreshes a haggard old template  quietly revolutionary  or boldly feminist  or just a well told story being true to itself

1328,stories_we_tell,sorting through those secrets through polley s candid interviews with her father  family members  and close family friends is fascinating to watch  deeply affectionate and sometimes very moving  if a personal memoir film by a beautiful  successful young woman from a nice toronto family sounds to you like it can only be an excuse for self absorbed navel gazing  well  you must not have seen a sarah polley movie yet  stories we tell is one of those movies you watch on a screen and replay in your head for days  moving between its many levels of inquiry and touched  always  by polley s compassion toward her relatives in particular and people in general  what saves it is our realisation that it isn t just a documentary  polley     smilingly tells us that a story like hers can never truly be tied down  even as she screws every last piece into place  everyone has a different story  i found myself holding my breath listening to them talk  the story twists like a thriller  stories we tell is not just very moving  it is an exploration of truth and fiction that will stay with you long after repeated viewings

1330,let_the_fire_burn_2013,the violent clash between constitutional freedoms and social society  not to mention the racial conflict  make for a very american story  there have been many documentaries comprised entirely out of archival footage  but few as powerfully and masterfully structured as this one  director jason osder s grieving account of the deadly police assault on the move collective s fortified philadelphia row house works small  continuous miracles with a variety of existing footage   osder  cuts between news footage of the events as they unfurled and testimony from hearings held afterward to create a stark  nonjudgmental portrait of an incident that probably needn t have happened  brilliantly edited  the film moves back and forth in time  first tracking the events leading up to the confrontation through news reports of the day  eschews talking heads tradition in its potent examination of the 1985 philadelphia police firebombing of a radical group known as move  osder creates both intensity and intimacy  inviting viewers simply to watch and listen as a tragedy   born of unchecked aggression  incoherent ideology and appallingly faulty logic   unfolds  piecing the components together  and only sparingly deploying intertitle cards for clarity  let the fire burn brings this 28 year old tragedy front and center again   vividly  viscerally  uses no narrators  talking heads or fancy graphics to tell its devastating story  it doesn t need to  it earns its considerable impact by telling an unnerving story and leaving it  in ways both daring and effective  fundamentally unresolved  jason osder s gripping documentary revisits the notorious 1985 police raid against the black liberation group move in west philadelphia  the pure archive approach leaves a taste of despair  civic governance  it seems  can t even promise not to kill you  the second most striking thing about jason osder s documentary let the fire burn is that it s composed entirely of archival footage  but the most striking thing is the actual story it tells with that footage  
1331,blue_jasmine,it s brilliantly watchable  if not mesmerising  and brilliantly performed  particularly by cate blanchett  who will knock your socks off  and may knock them off so explosively there is every chance you will never retrieve them again  blue jasmine weaponises blanchett s elegant image against us  showing a character who is trying with all her might to maintain this glamour that is falling down around her  seriously  she s amazing in this one      what a fine way to revere one of williams  most adapted dramas with a modern take that thrusts its slowly malfunctioning central character into a new situation that only hastens her demise  in its basic situation can be heard the distant clang of a streetcar named desire  though it s neither pastiche nor reprise  just a quietly respectful tribute  blanchett  wielding a stiff cocktail in one hand and a bottle of anti anxiety pills in the other  gives her character a skillful shove from neurotic towards psychotic  a sharply observed  post economic crash comedy drama that boasts a formidable performance by cate blanchett and addresses such pertinent real world concerns as class  gender and corporate criminality in urban america  while the film may hold some viewers at arm s length  the performances are worthy of stand up and cheer ovations all round  a propulsive drama set in new york and san francisco about a woman s self destruction as a result of her inability to look truthfully at her own life  it s a serious warning  brutal even  though not quite the masterpiece some have claimed  the picture  often funny  but not a comedy  certainly delivers on emotion  sharp dialogue and toxic energy  if you don t buy this stuff you don t buy it  though millions do and perhaps millions will  woody has snapped to wakefulness  his comic and dramatic synapses firing off with an old ease that s deeply gratifying  you needn t even place it in allen s very top rank to call it his best in about two decades

1333,blancanieves,it s like watching a gorgeous tragi comic opera written by dickens and co directed by fellini and almodovar  a spanish take on snow white that picks up where the artist left off and shows the full elegance of silent filmmaking  no film this year will look as swooningly beautiful  its deep focus monochrome vividly rendered by the cinematographer kiko de la rica  and not many will sound as good  either  thanks to a score by alfonso de vilallong  alfonso de vilallonga s music isn t mere accompaniment  it s a score with rich emotional resonance  the silents  as this film suggests  achieved aesthetic marvels before sound came along to set things back for a while  had berger gone deeper into rafita s sad passion he might have passed beyond the safe frontiers of disney and into the twisted realm of buuel  if you re looking for visual kicks  this offers plenty  it hardly needs to be said that this fairytale is not really intended for children  in truth  few fairytales are  it feels saturated with pleasure  it is extremely pleasurable to watch  and shows every sign of having been extremely pleasurable to make  will we soon get a movie every year  or every month  devoted to actors in silent cinema slap doing kitschy dumb play to music accompanied monochrome  
1334,room_237_2012,do the kabbalist readings or wild free associations that room 237 celebrates improve the shining  let s say that they create a parallel text  lost in the overlook  in search of the overlooked  don t watch this film and expect an authoritative critical analysis of the film  watch it and explore the distorting  drug like pull that some art can exert on its audience  the human brain is a marvellously suggestible organ  there s enough real evidence supporting the theory that kubrick was a genius  and that s pretty entertaining all by itself  you don t have to buy any of the nutty theories in room 237 to appreciate what director rodney ascher has accomplished  their imaginings are not far removed from the deconstuctionist gobbledygook that has hammerlocked academic film and literary scholarship  but here at least the gobbledygook is entertaining  i suspect that ascher s intention was to dynamize an academic exercise  but these constant  sundry inserts render the tone as corny and glib as a vh1 special   room 237  is an act of uncommon devotion to cinema  embracing the notion that movies are best defined by what happens to us as we watch them   how our own beliefs and experiences dictate our interpretation of what we ve seen and heard  this is sure to amuse you if you get a bang out of the claims that paul mccartney died in 1966 and dark side of the moon was intended as a soundtrack for the wizard of oz  i found most of what s actually put forth in the film interpretively ridiculous  but i m just one theorist among millions  and the film worked for me anyway  listening to fanatics go on and on about their fixations can be kind of fun  for a while  at least  a beautifully edited  deeply strange compendium of what different people have read into a single film  
1335,philomena,the movie is a bit of a puzzle coming from atheist co writer steve coogan and the script grapples with these big questions of religion  class  and justice in a way that s far beyond the typical teary human interest story  what at first seems formulaic comedy gains a deeper resonance as we see how they represent two responses to cruelty and injustice    first outrage  and with time  eventually  forgiveness  even as philomena embraces the expected feel good dynamics  it avoids taking the usual path and doesn t paint all of the  evil  nuns with the same brush  solving this mystery is not nearly as engrossing as watching the actors  pas de deux  we wouldn t care about any of this if the performances were weak  but both actors find complexity and depth  director steven frears deserves special mention  a lesser filmmaker could so easily have turned this project into mushy  sentimental junk  the tear jerking moments here are heartfelt and real  it s the kind of filmmaking we see too little of today  dench is a delight  playing dowdy instead of her standard regal  and coogan is appropriately droll and disillusioned  together they manage to make a sad story feel somehow bright  a true story that takes unexpected  unusually poignant turns  the chemistry between steve coogan as a snooty journalist and judi dench as a retired nurse searching for her son brings humor and warmth to a harrowing tale of the plight of unwed irish catholic mothers in the 1950s  an utterly charming combination of road trip  odd couple comedy and heart touching true story that will leave few dry eyed   philomena  rests comfortably in the lap of the great judi dench  the story touches on some of the thorniest issues of catholic doctrine and tempers its righteous anger with a tone more sad than bitter  director stephen frears manages to successfully walk the tricky line between comedy and dark drama  it keeps the audience off kilter a bit  but in a good way  we shouldn t always need to know what s coming next  in terms of tone or plot

1337,rush_2013,this thrilling drama is no more for petrol heads only than titanic is solely of interest to historic ship enthusiasts  an entertaining movie with two solid performances that only occasionally stalls because of its sometimes heavy handed treatment of hunt and lauda s differences  considering the subject matter  rush delivers the expected visceral jolts  what s surprising is how endearing it is  even when its two protagonists are behaving like little more than boys with very fast toys  if you don t already know the story of that season  lucky you  even now  it exerts a ridiculous thrill  rush is an outsize hollywood spectacle about two outsize personalities in conflict  a sleekly assembled thrill machine that makes up in excitement for what it lacks in nuance  ron howard has brought this story to life with unbridled energy  transforming each race into an adrenaline charged vignette that could serve as a master class in staging and editing action scenes  stripped down characters and skeletal dramaturgy limit this movie about the real life formula 1 racing rivalry of james hunt and niki lauda  but harrowing track scenes and an affecting second half provide some vivid compensation  this is a deeply adult drama  not least because howard shows the costs of being so driven in a sport in which a driver is encased in a potential fireball   rush  is the kind of hollywood studio production that has sadly become all too rare   a smart  exciting  r rated entertainment for grown ups that quickens your pulse and puts on a great show   rush  ranks among the best movies about auto racing ever made  featuring two great performances from the leads  this is no mere thrill ride by two real life rival speedsters  although it is certainly that  the film also provides a sobering look at what it takes to be a true champion

1344,the_spectacular_now, ponsoldt  enjoys playing with our expectations by following conventions  luring us into the sense that we know what s coming  and then swerving just a little off road for a detour  this adaptation of tim tharp s novel  directed with delicate restraint by james ponsoldt  sneaks up on you  it makes you laugh  then it breaks your heart  teller and woodley hum together  and the movie does their performances justice  this coming of age movie should appeal to smart  sensitive young people who haven t been exposed to the better examples of the genre  so many films featuring teens seem overstimulated or familiar  this one strikes a deep  rich note and holds it  by the end of the spectacular now  you re not quite ready to let these characters go  it s rare hybrid  a movie that can find an audience among both adults and teens  in the spectacular now  the high school seniors look and talk like actual high school seniors  the movie captures the raw excitement and heartbreak of adolescence so completely that it manages to replace a seen it all jaded heart with the butterflies that accompany fresh experiences  it feels real  its emotions earned  it shies away from the big dramatic moment for the most part  instead doling out little victories and small defeats  which is similar to the way most of us experienced our teen years  fairly close to great  a lovely movie about young people that is in no way a formula picture  original  truthful and moving  it s not about the phenomenon of being young  but about the particular characters  who are as specific and vivid as actual people  woodley is genuinely wonderful in it  and teller s right behind her  touching  funny  romantic  and so remarkably real  james ponsoldt s teen drama captures a truth about our formative years that so many other similar films fail to come close to grasping

1348,the_crash_reel_2013,few documentaries manage to show character arcs as full as the one walker captures here  another memorable piece of storytelling from the oscar winning director  ms  walker doesn t go too deeply into the questions all this raises  but at least she broaches them  are the sponsors of these athletes promoting recklessness by encouraging stars to push the limits  amidst all the trauma that had me crying more than once throughout the film   i was amazed by the incredible feats performed by the athletes  the tale of a modern day icarus  his wings didn t melt  but his brain cracked  he lived  but he learned to question the trip  with its high energy music and graffiti style graphics  the crash reel plays like the slick promos nbc uses to repackage every olympian s story into a pat narrative  it compellingly captures a family wrestling mightily with the riddles and contradictions of a culture that promotes achievement at all costs with little thought as to what that actually means  as thrilling as rush  but with a very different kind of happy ending  the film captures the horror and danger and the druggy thrill  we understand why these kids want their  highs  even when the cost of coming low can be fatal  lucy walker has assembled one of the great sporting docs   partly because its scope extends beyond the slopes  
1349,a_touch_of_sin,beyond the spattered blood and broken bones  jia s usual levels of compassion and social analysis are maintained  teases together four disparate stories of people driven to violence by the purgatorial pain of their modern existence  as an eastern western it s like the searchers with missing gps  the spectator wants guidance   but may not want it long enough to stay the journey  there s more than a nod to king hu s touch of zen as zhangke unleashes a four fisted chunk of ultraviolent fury  tarantino would approve   a  bracing and unexpected offering from a director we thought we knew  this masterwork is set in contemporary china  where the gulf between those able to maneuver  or manipulate  the country s economies of change and those left behind or defeated by the seismic shifts widens  jia is passionate about his characters  but that never compromises his considerable artistic control  jia s primary concern here is the solitary suffering of his characters  punished to the point where they can t take anymore  fists are raised  pistols are cocked and knives are brandished in jia zhangke s dystopian and throbbing take on modern china  in jia s methodically furious vision  the ambient violence of unchecked power erupts among the insulted and injured with a horrific yet liberating sense of destruction and self destruction  a corrosive depiction of the new china  an everything for sale society still figuring out how to cope with the dehumanizing effects of unbridled capitalism  
1350,in_a_world_2013,in a world questions just what about any voice is authentic and valuable  and with any luck  it ll be bell s own calling card to more voiceover work  the simplicity of the film s plot leaves plenty of breathing room for the cast to just bounce lines and looks off one another  which they do with the relaxed aplomb of an alt comedy all star team  writer director lake bell is also the star of this quick witted beguiling comedy of female identity  family ties and an unseen but fiercely competitive aspect of the film business  can t wait to see what lake bell the filmmaker does next  bell s revelation is that females  even high achieving ones  are surprisingly likely to use a voice that suggests they re an ickle wickle pushover  this snappy treat tickles up belly laughs from the golden larynx of the entertainment industry  as it delves into the strangely competitive world of the voiceover artist  there is great invention  fine writing and spirited direction on display here  in a world where american comedies often die in ditches  pushed in by negative roadblocking  useless scripts  miscast stars   here is an affirmative mirth work  modestly cast  which actually makes you giggle there s a difference between paying your dues and self abasement  but you wouldn t know it from this overstuffed and joyless film  a clever  likable comedy that sends up sexism  satirizes hollywood  examines family ties and features a surprisingly tender romance at its core an indie comedy as surprisingly tender and wise as it is deftly wise cracking  
1351,blue_is_the_warmest_color,scene after scene brings truthfulness and insight into the at times difficult relationship  a love story so erotically charged that it short circuits our higher functions  
1352,the_sapphires_2012,this feelgood flick will almost certainly be an international hit and it is undeniably uplifting  the joyousness of soul music smoothing out the odd shifts in tone that arise as a result of the strange genre conflict  this charming australian import has a groove much like other low key  let s put on a show indies such as hear my song and the commitments  and never uses its social conscience as simply backbeat  exuberant but fairly formulaic  the harmonies they strike in this reality inspired charmer are sweetly sublime  you could drive an abrams tank through the film s plot holes  but you ll likely be too busy enjoying yourself to bother  sapphires is hardly a cinematic diamond mine  but this commitments style mashup of music and melodrama manages to entertain without demanding too much of its audience  draining most of the blood  sweat and tears from a true story  this music minded movie capably covers a song we ve heard a hundred times before  let s trivialize a legacy of cruelty and denigration  in a country where indigenous people suffered from centuries of human rights abuse  and let s make the carnage of vietnam look like a paintball game  delirious surprises crowd out the clichs in this thoroughly disarming movie  a very conventional story of a  60s australian girl group gains extra power from its context and setting in this fact based story set to the beat of motown soul  it helps that the leading actors are so skillful and appealing  beginning with chris o dowd as a roguish irishman who becomes the girls  manager    why resist

1354,the_history_of_future_folk_2012,a delightful sci fi adventure that simultaneously strips the genre down to its low tech basics and infuses it with audacious new verve  the nonsense proves good  goofy fun that works well because  history  at least acts as if it takes itself seriously  going easy on obvious ironies while dishing out catchy tunes  you d be hard pressed to find a better example of unadulterated escapism in which the craftsmanship lies not in visual polish but the universal appeal of a catchy tune  even as an apocalyptic plot pushing rescue mission unfolds  slapstick police chases keep the level of diverting quirk high  and the husband wife father daughter dynamics remain central  a low key sci fi mashup that charms by focusing on character rather than grandiose special effects  
1355,war_witch,nguyen s direction and script rarely falter  it s a near perfect blend of harsh reality and mysticism  atrocity and beauty somehow co exist in war witch  nguyen brings the harshness of this world alive not with big dramatic flourishes but with an everyday tone that makes it all the more frightening  this is how it is   how else would it be  canadian writer director kim nguyen spent nearly a decade researching this docudrama about child soldiers in africa  and the film feels as authoritative as a first hand account  nguyen  astonishingly  manages to wring something vaguely like a happy ending from this tragic story  war witch is most effective not when we are looking in on komona but when we are inside her head  this intense  gripping drama is utterly transporting  the movie is committed to revealing the world through komona s eyes  and you never feel a taint of voyeurism or condescension  it stays true to her  though ostensibly a character study  it s nevertheless characterized by the vaguely moralizing tone of an issue film  one whose candor in face of brutality seems calculated for maximum liberal appeal  war witch is a remarkably mature portrait that trusts its audience to have their own reactions to its material  it doesn t yank at the heartstrings so much as expertly tune them  it s depressing stuff  to be sure  but it does a marvelous job at giving us an impressionistic taste of horrific circumstances without using them to beat us into submission  nguyen s matter of fact storytelling proves to be the right match for a life of extraordinary suffering  
1356,star_trek_into_darkness,j j  abrams once again successfully creates a fast paced summer adventure that audiences should love  it leaves fans wondering what s next in the franchise  which will surely make paramount happy  but doesn t stand on its own like the truly great part twos

1364,still_mine,lovely performances by cromwell and bujold  as well as those playing their extended family of children and friends  are understated yet truthful  and it s good to be reminded that love that withstands a lifetime is a most precious thing  growing old together can t be easy  but in this case  it s certainly beautiful  writer director michael mcgowan  saint ralph  shows affinity for the subtle undercurrents of a long  happy marriage  but the friction between cromwell and the government bureaucracy stays one note  while this slight canadian film has limited appeal for general audiences  seniors and families affected by alzheimer s will find much to identify with  at its best  still mine gives off that feeling that we re watching something private  something genuine between two people who absolutely adore each other and have for decades  bujold amply conveys irene s longing for craig in deep toned ways that one almost never sees in movies about people over the age of 70  actually  you rarely see it in movies about people of any age anymore  it is so sweetly portrayed it will make you eager to get old  more vital than a thousand movies populated by hot  squirming teenagers  what would otherwise have been be a rather banal david goliath story     is elevated by cromwell into something more weighty  and even existentially profound  the mounting structure and the subsequent stop work orders frames the couple s reflections about the approaching uncertainties of their twilight years  which they deliver with humor and affection

1368,the_punk_singer_2013,initially held together by grainy vhs footage and cuttings from old fanzines  the film is gifted with a protagonist of endless brio and a cultural backdrop just distant enough to feel forgotten  the movie succeeds as a punk chronicle by focusing on a true believer who was lionized by many but who turned out to be only human  
1369,much_ado_about_nothing_2012,dp jay hunter s camera floats like a butterfly through doorways and windows  stinging as it catches characters in moments of eavesdropping inspired stunned epiphany  but it is the dark side of much ado everything associated with the smearing of hero s reputation and her lover claudio s savage rejection of her that emerges most forcefully here more familiar than fresh  but no less amusing  whedon uses shakespeare to remind audiences that the problems that existed in the seventeenth century remain relevant and embedded in the human heart  much ado about nothing is a delightfully spirited romp  filled with visual splendor  strong performances and flashes of post modern absurdity  it s a boozy  lusty  all night party interpretation of shakespeare that ultimately casts frivolity aside for a disarmingly moving finale  the magic holds  it holds from beginning to end  as in many of shakespeare s comedies  dark moments mark the dramatic action midway through much ado about nothing  but whedon brings the proceedings back to boisterous life in the last act  there s no fire  and where their lines should ricochet with wit  they just spill forth  affably  whedon finds unexpected meaning in this famously saucy  skirmish of wit   the opposites attract story upon which myriad modern day rom coms have sprung  no matter what movie or television show he is making  whedon is a master of wit  of clever wordplay that doesn t just entertain but crackles with knowing energy  much ado about nothing couldn t look more different than branagh s traditional version  and yet its big hearted spirit is equal to the task of celebrating a classic while highlighting the reasons to remake it  it s a smart  clever diversion in a season dominated by loud blockbusters and cgi extravaganzas  it makes one wish whedon would get his friends together more often

1373,mother_of_george_2013,a stunningly imagined account of african immigrant life in present day brooklyn  
1374,our_nixon,a capably done account of a presidential career that was wrecked by a crime that was unnecessary  there has never been an uninteresting angle on richard nixon   the man was too twisted   but penny lane s documentary sees him from several especially compelling new vantages   s hows the precise moment when new image technology would alter power  it s an exploration of the banality of evil that constantly puts banality first  but this is a relatively narrow experimental film designed to supplement rather than replace more thorough histories  our nixon shows that while the stooges were good at scheming  up until watergate  at least  they sucked as filmmakers  the real takeaway here is a tone of dawning tragedy  sourness sneaking into even the most innocuous of visual records  more entertaining curio than revelatory document  efficient found footage collage is more evocative than revelatory  it evokes a such crazy quilt of emotions and memories that children all over america are going to be wondering why their grandparents are crying or throwing shoes at the tv or both  it just feels redundant  perhaps little or nothing on the home movies lent itself to a richer portrait  the retrieved home movie footage creates a lambent prism through which the  70s seem like a simpler time  it also makes our nixon a uniquely dynamic time capsule  a brisk  eye opening documentary about the nixon white house  this triumph of editing is composed of homemovies  accompanied by later tv interviews and priceless audio from the secret tapes  making it a must see for anyone interested in americana

1377,a_place_at_the_table_2013,while the film stays true to the individual accounts  it doesn t shy away from the complex political issues behind hunger that affect all of us  you don t have to be a fan of info graphics in social justice docs to be troubled by one showing that the price of processed food has decreased in almost exact proportion to the rise in cost of fresh fruits and vegetables   a place at the table  presents a shameful truth that should leave viewers dismayed and angry  this nation has more than enough food for all its people  yet millions of them are hungry  it specifically addresses our country s hunger crisis  but it also speaks to larger hungers  hungers for independence  a dignified life  a better chance for ones children in short  the american dream  see it and weep  revealing little that a moderately informed viewer will not already know  the film shies away from the outrage and bare knuckle journalism that this shameful topic deserves  a tighter focus  or even just a voiceover narration  might have helped  their stories are wrenching and provide a functional framework for the directors to make some important points about hunger in america  a graceless info dump bracketed by interviews with activists and a handful of personal stories from suffering families around the country  
1378,upstream_color,blending languorous visual sensuality with a driving sense of paranoid urgency  this metaphorical mix of skin crawling body horror and lynchian mystery boasts a compelling dream logic that offsets its huge potential for being pretentious studenty twaddle  the most visually imaginative american film since david lynch s eraserhead

1380,fill_the_void,as opposed to the bleak view of sexual subjugation in kadosh  amos gitai s 1999 film about hasidic marriage  fill the void sees burshtein fortrightly and wittily asserting that this is how her community lives  fill the void is as well versed in the rules of matchmaking as a jane austen novel  and it bends them as artfully as wicker  its last five minutes are so extraordinarily enigmatic  you re certain the subject of innocence  guilt and attraction has been addressed on a deep level  a nuanced kitchen sink depiction of an israeli hassidic community which zeroes in on the dilemma of an 18 year old girl named shira  this is an extraordinary first film  nerve tingling in its intensity  and assembled with a finesse and control even the great austrian director michael haneke might envy  beautiful and mysterious  the se  first glimpses are an ideal primer for the israeli film  which never rushes to spell out the meanings of its subtle and quiet moments  it s an artful  character driven drama that constitutes a minor miracle of empathy  burshtein has achieved a gripping film without victims or villains  an ambiguous tragedy drawing on universal themes of love and loss  self sacrifice and self preservation  director rama burshtein s debut is nothing less than astonishing  she s a card carrying member of israel s hared community and  with that experience  has crafted a work of moral complexity and visual artistry  burshtein  vividly depicts a clannish culture that is likely to feel foreign and perhaps off putting to generations that came of age in a progressive post feminist era  a sympathetic  layered portrayal  rich with detail  that earns its more complex and resonant conclusion  none of the religious rituals feels particularly spiritual  and even the nominally happy ending fails to alleviate the oppressive tone  
1381,prisoners_2013,guzikowski s well honed thriller occasionally idles under villeneuve s dark character studies  but the director s powerfully imposed mood of dread elevates what might otherwise have been just a superior police procedural  an increasingly sloppy thriller  filled with obvious clues  laughable red herrings  and halfhearted  shock  reveals  played at a snail s pace that lets far too much air into the narrative  manages to fire the intellect and stimulate further researches into arendt s work  one of the most satisfying thrillers we have seen in quite some time  a hulking gothic whodunit which sadly falls to pieces in its final act  the cast and creators are released early for good behaviour  prisoners is weary after ten minutes  and i suppose it has persuaded itself that its length is justified by its solemn gaze into the abyss  a certain dour realist vigour keeps the nightmare alive  a decent  cogent  greyly atmospheric thriller with something to say about war on terror america  it s got lofty aspirations but it also wants to wallow in the muck   to thrill you and sicken you in equal measure while also being about something  
1382,what_maisie_knew_2012,scott mcgehee and david siegel s adaptation commendably preserves the book s child perspective even if it doesn t quite match the characteristically dark shades of the author s moral fare  handsomely shot and stopping just short of cloying sentiment  this is an accomplished  engaging work  the film begins ham handedly and ends in a puddle of mawkishness  but most everything in between is sharply observed and wounding to watch  on the surface  this indie does sound like standard issue material  but its dynamics are far more complex than its simple exterior  what maisie knew gives the audience a ground eye view of its mesmerizing title character  a plucky  charismatic new yorker who navigates downtown bars and building lobbies with the street savvy of a pro  the result is a film that deeply engages us on multiple levels  not only do we wonder what maisie knows and how she knows it  we want to get this seedling to a place where she won t have to be transplanted every day  the aggravatingly manipulative what maisie knew feels  perhaps deliberately  as if its emotions were drawn in brightly colored crayon  as maisie  aprile seems lit from within  a more vividly natural child actress i have trouble imagining  
1383,sunshine_on_leith,to say you don t like an upbeat british film this unpretentiously nice is like saying you don t like tea and biscuits  there are sentimental elements  and not all the songs are top drawer  but despite that the unlikely idea of having characters burst into song as they walk down the street or drink in a pub worked for me  the flash mob finale  with what looks like 500 dancing edinburghers  is about the most fun i ve had in a cinema this year  we d say it was a celtic umbrellas of cherbourg  but they didn t have headbutts or anything like as much fun in that film  big smiles are guaranteed for dexter fletcher s charming musical monument to the proclaimers  leaves you with cask strength  capillary reddening tingles of happiness that run to the very tip of your nose  a remorselessly rousing attempt to do for the scottish pub rock twins what mamma mia  did for abba or tommy for the who  for all its rough edges and emotional shortcuts  the movie s nothing if not unassailably genial  it s hard to keep the grin off your face when mackay and guthrie   both fantastic   launch gamely into the endearingly scrappy song and dance routines  
1384,koch_2012,even if he stomped on your special interest you can t deny that he did it with a sui generis verve that mixed region specific curmudgeon ism and impish joie de vivre 
1385,in_the_house_2013,satirizes the process of aesthetic creation and the damage it can inflict on the artist and those around him  the film treats imagination and talent in certain hands as an almost mystical force  ozon and the script move a little too far afield and hold on a bit too long as the film approaches its end  still   in the house  has enough trippy truth to it to grab your interest and shake your mind  the expected punch line    never materializes  so i guess this must be a drama after all  savor in the house for its meta exploration of adolescence  class resentment and suppressed desire  but don t expect much more  ozon is an artful provocateur and observer of human nature  a sharp  enticing psychological cat and mouse game  its gleeful dark wit comes from manipulations  voyeurism  the idea that we all invade each other s lives and thoughts  darkly funny and utterly compelling  it s arguably the best teacher student movie since 1999 s election   in the house  promises to be a social satire with a flash of hitchcockian menace  but gradually it turns into a routine thumb sucker on reality versus fiction  the final scene is so open ended that like germain  you won t want the story to end

1387,the_wolf_of_wall_street_2013,the film has roused censure for glorifying crime  with scant  awkwardly realised minutes paid to belfort s eventual comeuppance  but surely 71 year old scorsese  a one time wannabe priest whose work is preoccupied with morality  did that deliberately  scorsese is fascinated by procedure  by drawing back the curtain and showing us how things happen  though he keeps the picture nimble and entertaining enough to avoid burying himself in the minutiae  dicaprio s powerhouse performance  and scorsese s brilliantly energetic direction make this a must watch for film lovers  movies shouldn t provide moral instruction but the best incorporate competing philosophies  unfortunately  there is no one scorsese can bring himself to be quite as interested in as belfort  at times  the film seems almost hobbitian in its inability to finish a scene that is already well past its natural lifespan  every time i looked at my watch  the hands seemed to have stayed still  for three hours the movie operates at a ridiculous comedic pitch  you never forget you re at the circus  you never lose site of the lawlessness  the reckless pleasure  the sheer lunacy and lack of regulation  it lets you relish in unparalleled no holds barred debauchery while increasingly disillusioning the fun and games with the nasty reality of the situation along the way  scorsese unleashes a furious  yet exquisitely controlled  kinetic energy  complete with a plunging and soaring camera  mercurial and conspicuous special effects  counterfactual scenes  subjective fantasies  and swirling choreography on a grand scale  
1388,hannah_arendt,it is an absolute treasure to see and inspires its viewers to return to the literature of this lauded thinker  this all may sound all very heavy  but it is important to also point out that hannah arendt is also a good movie  it s refreshing to find a film inspired by challenging ideas  and von trotta and her team are to be congratulated for bringing arendt s story to the screen sukowa is a supple and brave actress  getting inside arendt s arguments is the hardest and if the film only succeeds sometimes  that is still a major achievement  very few films in this era would have dared  von trotta s style is pretty stolid  she aims for documentary thoroughness rather than exhilarating drama  nonetheless  it s good to see a film that gets its narrative charge from the ferment of intellectual debate  it s a rare breed  arendt  through the film s glamorizing lens  becomes a character impossible not to identify or agree with  barbara sukowa delivers a beautifully modulated performance  showing the rigor of arendt s thought and convictions while revealing the contours of a passionate woman with complex relationships  this is an interesting film about ideas  and how explosive they can be  von trotta s direction is assured and the film has an incredibly strong performance at its core  and it asks a number of important questions  even though it doesn t dare to answer them  like a hidden method  david cronenberg s drama about sigmund freud and carl jung  hannah arendt takes seriously the life of the mind  balanced portrayal  makes a persuasive case that arendt was a valuable voice  whose dedicated work in trying to unravel the causes of europe s moral collapse was worthy of study and consideration

1390,yossi_2013,eytan fox depicts modern gay life and contemporary tel aviv with sympathy and knowing insight  and he excels at creating casual rapport among actors  yet in film after film he undermines these gifts with hamfisted melodramatic plotting  the perfectly sculpted  entirely sure of himself tom ultimately seems more of a construct than a character  his carefree nature shaped almost entirely by the very wish fulfillment clichs that the movie otherwise sidesteps m his mostly self created shell  
1391,narco_cultura_2013,it s impossible to watch shaul schwarz s grueling documentary about the mexican drug wars and their influence on the whole of mexican society without wondering how on earth such a hell on earth could have erupted right in our back yard  this issue based journalism piece yields diminishing returns the deeper it digs  this haunting documentary contrasts songs saluting mexican drug lords as heroic bandits with the harrowing reality of life in murder stained juarez  this dispassionate but devastating film looks at the drug wars from two very different but chillingly complementary perspectives  the mexican drug wars have claimed approximately 60 000 lives in the last six years  you can purchase the soundtrack on itunes  there is nothing here that hasn t been more thoroughly documented in other studies of the drug related crime that grips ju rez   i think we can be the next hip hop   boasts a narcocorrido impresario  who s surely kidding himself  narco cultura shows in fascinating detail how these merciless killers who have taken over the city have become robin hood style folk heroes  a potent encapsulation of how fame and finance beget fear and grief  ping ponging between grisly south of the border carnage and angeleno musician edgar quintero s growing success as one of the subgenre s stars  you start to see how this parasitic relationship works

1396,we_are_what_we_are_2013,an ambitious  if somewhat uneven  slice of downbeat american gothic which interweaves grim melancholia with pointed satire  doomy portent and moments of gnawing revulsion  mickle and co writer nick damici give themselves plenty of time to tease out their themes and ladle on the tension  another pointless remake  stupendously dull  dull with that blend of overloaded effect and under supplied affect that bad horror alone truly offers  this social realist take on the cannibal sub genre makes for a surprising lyrical and quietly profound piece of filmmaking  mickle prizes credible characterisation above everything else  and casts extremely good actors  who succeed in making the parker clan feel both frail and somehow stuck out of time  like freak survivors from the 19th century  a crunching  visceral transplant for this cannibal tale from its urban mexican setting to an american milieu  the cast is uniformly excellent    including an extended cameo by top gun s kelly mcgillis  qt regular michael parks  and genre director larry fessenden    and is buoyed by a particularly unobtrusive yet unsettling score from jeff grace and darren morris  we are what we are doesn t waste time with cheap scares  mickle keeps his story on a steady  slow simmer  transporting us minute by minute into the very heart of dread  there s some fun to be had  as long as your idea of fun includes being grossed out  one of the more remarkable horror films of late one that does not rely on sudden shocks or outrageous gore to get under the skin of its viewers

1406,life_itself,if you aren t moved by life itself  you ought to have your heart examined  the film s core is footage shot during the last four months of ebert s life  when he had lost most of his jaw and was unable to eat or speak  it s hard to see him in this state  which makes his frequent cheerfulness and humor all the more remarkable  it s undercooked  we re not even told what movies he loved as a child  and a clip of the great new yorker critic pauline kael speaking made me sit bolt upright thinking  now you re talking   with the man s passing  american film lost not just an inimitable figure but a voice that was as forceful and distinctive as it was ubiquitous  a film about a movie critic might not sound an attractive proposition  but steve james s biographical documentary on pulitzer prize winning  chicago sun times journalist roger ebert  who died last year  is deeply moving  james puts ebert s criticism carefully in context  and isn t guilty of either overstating his influence or whitewashing the less genial aspects of the man  the strongest parts of the movie are those that deal with the sometimes radioactive relationship between siskel and ebert  a very worthy delve into a eventful life cut short by cancer  no less than james s capital punishment documentary at the death house door  this asks us to think long and hard about what it means to die with dignity  
1407,birdman_2014,a thunderbolt reminder of the kind of quick thinking  quick talking  quick witted characters that keaton used to specialize in  and i  rritu finds the right style to showcase his gifts  even when keaton is transforming his character s stock issues into ones that feel unique and genuine  he s undercut by his director s flashiness  right up to an on the nose finale  you are unlikely to see a better american film this year  it s a quasi religious fable about a man haunted by the past and facing a profound moral and existential crisis in the present  and it s a dazzling display of virtuoso cinematic technique and showboat performances  it is a work of magical realism  or perhaps moderate insanity  and it will take your breath away  you can t help liking the mind or minds that thought the film up  you wouldn t want to close it  and you can bet money on seeing michael keaton  here in blisteringly inventive form  in the best actor suspects  line up on oscar night  the characters in birdman don t always find redemption  but i  rritu s faith in people has never felt more real  the reason this scalding industry satire works as well as it does is because it has a grounding in some fairly uncomfortable truths about the movie business even as the plot indulges in flights    literally    of fancy  it s a pleasing irony that this study of one actor s search for honesty has been concocted using a repertoire of visual sleights of hand  a philosophical rumination it may be but that doesn t prevent it from also being an adrenalised delight  for all this admirably odd film s virtues  its pretensions do let it down at times  billy wilder once said   if you re going to tell people the truth  be funny or they ll kill you   i m guessing mexican writer director alejandro gonz lez i  rritu would agree  
1408,guardians_of_the_galaxy,blessed with a loose  anarchic b picture soul that encourages you to enjoy yourself even when you re not quite sure what s going on  the scruffy guardians is irreverent in a way that can bring the first star wars to mind  the lightly derisive  live action cartoon tone robs the movie of any majesty  even of the comic book type  and the many violent deaths of their suitable gravity  these meager pleasures are swallowed up in all the frantic action and overblown cg sequences  chris pratt  overflowing with charisma  plays the leader of the pack of misfits  and his blissed out space cowboy  with a love for seventies music  is so full of good will that he buoys the film and its requisite whizbang special effects  pratt is their prime asset for turning the comedy up to 11  with him playing star lord  you never question what quill brings to the team  a sparkling  cracked esprit de corps  it may be a mess  but it s an extremely good natured mess  full of humor and warmth  more surprising still  the very elements that seemed most likely to ruin the movie the tree man  the talking raccoon account for much of its improbable charm  guardians succeeds when it proves the marvel formula is malleable  it fails when it discovers that formula is not yet malleable enough  gunn appears to remember the high of certain kinds of moviegoing  where when the credits are over  all you want to do is get back in line and enjoy the whole thing again  at first i thought   this movie isn t as clever as it thinks it is   but after a while  i decided maybe it was after all  if you want a superior successor to red dwarf  blake s 7  star wars and  yes  scooby doo then look no further  there are worse things  finally  some jokey superheroes

1411,live_die_repeat_edge_of_tomorrow,credit a smart script  smarter direction  excellent production elements and an unflappable leading man for taking you to hell and back    over and over again  edge of tomorrow is the perfect mix of blustering action and sci fi thinky nonsense that is best enjoyed without picking at it too much  this is the kind of thoughtfully constructed movie that other summertime blockbusters should aspire to be more like  clever and cool and never giving you that ho hum sense that you ve seen it all before  it s the rare summer spectacle that  tacked on coda notwithstanding  might actually warrant repeat viewings  i can t say i was always quite sure what on earth was going on  but edge of tomorrow  despite its flaws  despite its feeling of deja vu  manages to be tolerably entertaining mainly because of its nicely calibrated sense of humour  the conceit may sound constricting  but liman  like harold ramis before him  gets exceptional mileage out of it  presenting his ever revolving tale with visual style  narrative velocity  and a wonderful dose of dark humor  edge of tomorrow is acceptable escapist entertainment whose unexpected plot developments give it much needed originality  the action scenes are handled with expected skill  the heroes are intrepid and the creatures are suitable nasty and vicious  why do invading extra terrestrials always bring with them the single thing that can wipe them out  couldn t they have hid it on jupiter or something  cruise is better than he s been in a while because he damps down his usual all intensity all the time mo  he s best here when his character seems the most scared  all in all  a perfectly superior example of industrially fortified hollywood fun  and as good a guarantee as doug liman can offer that we haven t seen the last of him yet  groundhog day re imagined as a sci fi war game  
1412,snowpiercer,a madcap addition to the comic book derived movies that have dominated cinematic summer fare  fueled by implausibility  and for a good portion of the ride much better for it  bong joon ho s snowpiercer posits a nonstop  earth encircling train containing the microcosmic survivors of a society killed off by a global warming induced deep freeze  once mr  bong sets his monorail in motion the movie assumes an irresistible momentum  accelerated by nonstop mayhem  gallows humor and an immersive visual style that possesses a heady sense of the steam punk apocalypse  it s so hard to describe how amazing snowpiercer is without giving away everything that makes it amazing  you couldn t ask for a better metaphor for hell on earth than what bong joon ho has wrought with snowpiercer  constant forward momentum while getting absolutely nowhere  suffering all the while  snowpiercer feels both heightened and grounded  allegorical yet familiar  able to be experienced  the confined space in no way inhibits tension or excitement  or a sense of forward momentum  it s a film not to be missed  the future is miserably dystopian as usual in this apocalyptic sci fi thriller  but at least it s thoughtful  stylishly crafted  high speed misery that keeps on hurtling relentlessly forward    even though there s nowhere to go  an object of blunt force and breath catching beauty  snowpiercer plays what if with a familiar doomsday scenario  what if noah s ark never found dry land again  it s a downbeat spectacle  but very good  unforgettably bizarre  original filmmaking and adventurously explored ideas can leave you feeling high  especially when you don t know quite how it s been pulled off  in the thick of summer  while hollywood is busy cranking out cookie cutter superhero movies and giant robot sequels  along comes snowpiercer to show everyone how it s done  
1413,two_days_one_night,as with their previous films  the brothers cast a discerning gaze on working class lives  without preachiness or sentimentality  two days  one night is contemporary social realism at its finest  portraying the complicated moral landscape we re constantly navigating and the difficult decisions this modern world has invariably wrought  a dilemma so simple and so timely  it barely feels like fiction  wonderbrothers jean pierre and luc dardenne return with a tale of heroic struggle against an ordinary disaster  in film after film the dardennes have proven themselves the cinema s most acute humanist critics of predatory capitalism  this masterful drama finds them at the top of their game  coursing underneath the film s calm  observant surface is a fury at a system that sets people in the same leaky boat at each other s throats  as usual  the dardenne brothers are never heavy handed  but also not coy about their politics  sooner or later  we all need a helping hand in our lives  but what happens when you need to convince people to extend one  none of this would work if cotillard s performance weren t so forthright and deeply felt  jean pierre and luc dardenne  comme d habitude  deliver first rate  suspenseful drama with an approach not unlike the cin ma v rit  style associated with documentary filmmaking    the dardennes take us into the ecosystem of need  by the time they are through  they ve cut a wide swath that covers most of the issues of the working class  
1414,gloria_2012,the script certainly couldn t give more of itself to its leading lady  and chilean tv star garcia accepts with a wondrous star turn that makes plain gloria s inner vitality  but doesn t stint on the petty insecurities holding her back in other respects  
1415,x_men_days_of_future_past,it trots along at a fair old pace  the cast doing a sterling job of keeping straight faces while spouting quasi scientific gobbledegook  i would be remiss not to note that tucked away amid all the existential melodrama is perhaps the most hilarious set piece ever to grace a superhero film  
1416,the_tale_of_the_princess_kaguya,while the characters feel very simplified at times  there are scenes that put great weight on performance and subtle expressions  in a way that s nearer to the classical disney tradition than most japanese animation  be prepared for a melancholy denouement that s not suitable for younger children  but which grown ups and older kids may find heartbreaking  it has a delicacy and a hand crafted feel that you won t find in the latest dreamworks or pixar blockbuster  instead of brash primary colours  takahata uses a pale and watery palette  no one goes to studio ghibli for incident  this is a film making model that favours contemplation over manufactured climaxes  lush  hand painted images offer plentiful consolation  but its beauty forms a gilded cage  until the undeniably moving final movements  it just feels several shades too constrained to fully honour its heroine s restless  questing spirit  plays out as a wistful  slow burning romance  underscored with a streak of social satire and animated in exquisitely subtle pastels and watercolours  one can only hope ghibli maintains a creative standard as high as his  this delicate  hand drawn marvel is lyrical and heartbreaking in ways that most live action movies never approach  it s more deeply satisfying and complex than similar  hollywood produced fare   like fine wine compared with kool aid  
1417,starred_up,mackenzie is seeking to understand how all this explosive male energy can co exist under such brutal conditions  and the answer is with great difficulty  what makes starred up such a riveting experience is that  despite the often unintelligible brogues in which its characters speak  the film so vividly depicts the cutthroat culture of prison life that nothing gets lost in translation  take one teenager  add raw testosterone  arm with unquenchable  unreasoning anger  lock in pressure cooker cell  unleash  roll camera   starred up  manages to be sympathetic  not only because of o connell s galvanizing turn  but also asser and director david mackenzie s unwavering commitment to portraying his character with as much compassion as brutal honesty  the british prison movie starred up has the excitement of a nonstop psychological cage fight  but its goal is enlightenment  not terror or cheap thrills  it marries ferocious  unnerving violence and waves of profanity to powerful  psychologically acute performances in a way that is intensely dramatic as well as almost unbearable to watch at times  the raw emotions on display need no translation  david mackenzie directs the film in a piercingly realistic style  the most tremendous thing about starred up is exactly how simple it keeps things  and what a richly nuanced story emerges in the process  starred up is an edgy  teeming thriller  brilliantly disorienting  making strange a world we thought we knew  at least from other movies  audiences  the less squeamish at least  will benefit from mr  mackenzie s ability to wring white knuckling tension out of mr  asser s intelligent story  expect to hear a lot more from english actor jack o connell  who holds the screen as well as his character  eric  commands a cellblock  starred up has three powerful advantages  a realistic setting  fierce performances and the insight brought by scripter jonathan asser  who was an oliver like counselor in a tough london jail  o connell bristles with terrifying hair trigger unpredictability  watching him  you feel like you re witnessing the arrival of a new movie star

1420,captain_america_the_winter_soldier_2014,the fans won t be disappointed by the lavish visual effects  the explosions and gun battles  all of which are the essential elements in this kind of super cinema experience  beneath the expensive  computer generated busyness of this second captain america installment is a bracing  old style conspiracy thriller made extra scary by new technology and the increasingly ugly trade offs of a post 9 11 world  if captain america  the winter soldier is indeed an augur of things to come during this special effects laden summer  maybe it won t be such a painful season after all  this is the first marvel studios movie since the original iron man that really stands on its own  there s too much going on  the marvel universe stuff  the wikileaks ish paranoia stuff  the video game ish cg visual effects stuff  the epic john woo ish everybody pointing a weapon at everybody else face off stuff  we not only get an edgier  more complex  more compelling storyline  we get the most badass 95 year old the world has ever known  fans of this franchise should expect more than a boilerplate action flick that brings absolutely nothing new to the genre  if we must endure yet another spring summer cycle of comic book superheroes  this movie at least delivers the wham bang goods  recycled though they may be   i had fun  but i could have had more  like many others of its type   it  gets off to a kinetic start only to lose steam before blowing everything up  there s darkness and confusion just under its comic book surface  this film is unlikely to convert a non captain america lover into a fanatic but it s assembled with sufficient skill that those who enjoy this sort of motion picture will have a good time

1427,blue_ruin,the world doesn t need another empty genre exercise  but as blue ruin reminds us  it can always use more filmmakers of saulnier s resourcefulness  sensitivity and quiet assurance  with the same brand of realist irony the coens used to cool down blood simple  writer director jeremy saulnier slows the genre s heartbeat to gripping effect  blair  an unheralded actor  carries the whole picture  he s in practically every scene  and his performance is fascinating because in his eyes you can see the character struggling desperately with himself  saulnier makes impressive use of silence and slow camera movements  allowing the suspense to simmer until violence seems practically inevitable  though coloured by indie sensibilities  blue ruin offers the momentum of hard edged pulp and the viscera of full on exploitation cinema  a stripped down tale of revenge with bloodied hands and a blackened heart  this viscerally intelligent thriller takes a new stab at an old genre with refreshingly distressing results  a very bloody film noir  directed with tremendous ingenuity by jeremy saulnier  blue ruin benefits from its pared down style and macabre humour  to call blue ruin a revenge thriller is to sell this barbed wire sharp and altogether surprising american indie short  essentially a lurid revenge story but filtered through an arthouse sensibility  peppered with stillness and deglamourised violence  blue ruin is a low budget yet highly accomplished revenge thriller although whether you have the stomach for it is another matter  the filmmaker works with economy and has a knack for creating a sense of foreboding  which is good because the plot is simply a working out of the old saw that violence begets violence  
1428,the_lunchbox,batra s characters are a delight  they may be of mumbai  infused with intense desi flavours  but can inhabit any part of the world  the lunchbox is either a piquant romance or a wise comedy  the director s confidence with such a delicate story makes it successful as both  first time writer director batra nearly overplays his hand at a couple of moments  but all in all this is a film of finely judged reserve  and acutely anti sentimental  batra clearly adores his characters  we get a taste for them  too  a rolls royce romantic comedy set in mumbai that rides on a delectable  bittersweet central turn by irrfan khan  one of those films that gives words like  tender  and  touching  a good name  you would need to be some sort of monster to resist its charms  by its final act  pressing home the most un bollywood message that life s often more complicated than the movies it s assumed the feel and weight of a well observed short story  there s nothing wildly original here  but it s carried off with charm and wit  and a pair of very enjoyable central performances   the lunchbox  doesn t offer easy solutions  but it is filled with keen observations  all meals should be this satisfying  a pleasure  from the fascinating intricacies of mumbai style interlocking lunch containers to the quietly masterful performance of khan  the lunchbox offers us a naturalistic glimpse of middle class life in modern mumbai  if co writer and director ritesh batra occasionally takes his sweet time getting from point a to point b  it s equally true that he gives the audience a nice  comfortable ride

1432,a_girl_walks_home_alone_at_night,like no movie you ve ever seen  for all the visual ambition  this doesn t add up to anything terribly substantial  
1433,ernest_and_celestine,from its opening credits   it  proclaims its hand drawn  delicate  watercolour aesthetic  but it s not all sweetness and light  there s a dark strand of humour and some sly visual gags in this clever tale of opposites  two styles combine to create a world at once impressionistic and lived in  infused with the kind of warm glow which emanates from a cosy fireplace  ernest learns to share  celestine learns to a paint   and the audience learns that in a disney dominated marketplace  kids are still free to choose their own mini mouse  the pace and the style of e c  not to mention its wonderful attention to detail  lift the film from being merely sweet to being something special  a sweet natured tale of an unlikely friendship between a burly bear and a plucky mouse  it s also decidedly offbeat with an emphasis on animal dentistry  a joyous rediscovery of hand drawn animation  all witty and expressive lines  spare backgrounds and gorgeous  watery hues  it moves with the rhythms and emotions of classic kids  literature  possesses elegance and belly laughs in equal measure  and is almost magically beautiful to look at  and  like bears  it has bite  the message is simple  the ending earthshaking and a few scenes border on overly precious  but as the stakes are raised for the pair  a surprising depth of character emerges  delicate animation and a charming score may be why this belgian film earned an oscar nomination  its story  however  makes no sense whatsoever  it has things to say about the world  but it does so gracefully  without hitting you over the head with them  the enchanting french belgian animated feature ernest   celestine is so liltingly sweet and graceful that  a day or two after i saw it  it seemed almost as if i had dreamed it  every frame is suffused with a fireplace kind of warmth that  for me at least  cast an immediate spell that didn t let up  
1434,the_imitation_game,what could have been a very dry and earnest film emerges  under the intelligent direction of norwegian morten tyldum working from a screenplay by graham moore  as a gripping and still rather extraordinary story  we go into a movie knowing that the subject was as genius or a hero  a martyr or titan  we should leave with a more nuanced understanding of who he was  his complexities and flaws  for the filmmakers  there are simplifications that must have been inevitable  for dramatic and narrative purposes  when it comes to depicting the years of wartime work  but what of the other choices that have been made  cumberbatch is the main event here  making something almost impossible  capturing such a man as turing in a tidy two hour package  look easy  important  and appropriately imperfect  it s mostly to cumberbatch s credit that the imitation game plays like a solid  engaging historical drama  interesting enough to suit audiences that aren t interested in either world war ii history or technology  this film about one of the past century s smartest humans at times treats its own audience like a classroom of remedial learners  it s a film about drive  about imagination  and how brilliance thrives outside the mainstream  these are common enough themes given uncommon purchase in a film about a man who likely saved millions of lives by never fitting in  produced with a masterpiece theater eye for period detail  but also with a missionary s zeal to honor a wrongly dishonored man  unlike the king s speech  which won a clutch of oscars for its dull propriety and masterpiece theater vibe  the imitation game is vibrant and lively  engaging you on several levels  cumberbatch s finely calibrated performance helps bring to life one of history s lesser known stories and most shameful injustices

1438,the_overnighters,an existentially probing documentary with more layers than a twisty hollywood thriller  at turns inspiring  challenging  sobering and finally devastating  while initially a gentle interrogation of christian dogma  the overnighters expands to a larger investigation of altruism and its roots in private psychologies  moss lets his characters and their stories unfold  crafting a film from them intuitively through the right interview questions and the art of editing  but never placing a narrative on it that feels forced  moss uses images of drill towers or blistering flame as visual metaphors for other things transpiring on screen  the fracturing of a family  the heated fury that comes with a sense of betrayal  the movie might seem like just another liberal do gooder profile  yet a shocker ending throws new and disturbing light on the situation  amplifying the christian themes at the heart of the story  it s one of those steinbeck style stories of migrants  poverty  desperation and hope  a heartbreaking picture of men who still believe they are living the american dream in broken down trailers doing grim  unhealthy jobs  it s the rare documentary in which truly unpredictable events unfold and no assumption is safe  jesse moss s tough  absorbing documentary could almost be a modern day grapes of wrath  all about the us oil industry s fracking boom in north dakota  demands a rewatch  and is so stuffed with incident that someone should remake it into an overcooked  americana melodrama  an urgent portrait of compassion under fire  long before this unexpected development  the overnighters has established its credentials as a beautifully crafted  multi layered piece of storytelling  and as an important snapshot of the new great depression  
1439,wild_2014,for all of the trouble  wild  takes to get into strayed s head  you d think they might ve drafted filmmakers with a little bit more experience living in a place like that  it captures an emotional memoir without making it feel like a didactic tale of triumph over adversity  what i like most about wild is its nuance  its sense of uncertainty and its willingness to leave unanswerable questions unanswered  a film about someone going on a very long walk doesn t sound especially dramatic but nick hornby s screenplay  adapted from strayed s book  brings out cheryl s yearning as well as the epic quality of her mini odyssey  a quietly moving coming of age story that resists formula or easy redemption  driven by a strong  unvarnished performance from witherspoon  who deserves huge credit as both star and producer  obvious oscar bait is just that  way too obvious  an engrossing  moving and or well structured movie  made in a manner that evokes every ounce of sympathy for its heroine in her passion and her thirst for absolution  if nothing else  wild offers a first rate advertisement for the purifying abilities of the great outdoors  wild doesn t aim for high inspiration or fussy performances  and it benefits from staying honest and rich  instead of going for big speeches and bigger set pieces  witherspoon et al have done justice to strayed s story  such a monologue of a film depends entirely on the one main actor being pretty much irresistible  however trying her character s frailties  reese witherspoon is great in the part  not since june carter cash in walk the line has witherspoon been so present to a character  her cheryl is funny and messy  wounded but not without survival instincts  
1440,summers_tale,the film is a welcome tonic to the cinematic landfill that gets pushed into theatres this time of year  few directors could say as much with as little as eric rohmer  astute  unhurried and gently amusing  it will be welcomed by the director s fans while serving as a fine introduction for those who know him not  for all his seeming facility with the opposite sex  gaspard is really a romantic idiot  and aren t we all  rohmer suggests  the fresh faced actors  realistic dialogue and naturalistic performances suggest a casual approach  but as the story progresses  the filmmaker s control is increasingly evident  if it lacks its predecessor s subtlety and depth  it compensates with its own abundance of more immediate pleasures  originally released in 1996 in france  but never before in the u s    eric rohmer s sun kissed love quadrangle remains as fresh and romantically profound as it was 18 years ago  despite its googly eyed missive to the power of romance fueling confidence and comfort  a summer s tale is most salient when addressing the bonds of friendship  rohmer had an almost uncanny knack for using the mercurial predilections of the young as a launching pad for smart but not oppressive philosophical observations   a summer s tale  has room to focus on rohmer s brilliance at revealing human nature through articulate  multidimensional characters  perfectly cast  who in some ways seem to exist outside of time  a summer s tale feels like a great beach read of a movie  that deceptively slender paperback you tuck into your luggage because it s substantial without weighing much  poupaud may come off as callow and timid    but rohmer seems to suggest that his youthful mistakes will make him a better man  a typically generous  hopeful  and convincing sentiment in a disarmingly winning film  
1441,big_hero_6,the oversized and awkward  cute and caring baymax could easily be the preferred stocking stuffing this christmas  what you might not have heard before is the way this film laces that basic story with beautiful themes that push back against some of the assumptions of the genre  the film deals in a subtle and moving way with grief and teenage anxiety while serving up all the thrills of a big budget animated movie with superhero protagonists  an origins story ripe with innocence and loss  this anime inflected treat harks back to disney s big hearted heritage even as it looks forward towards new worlds of innovation  it makes for an entertaining spectacle  though less interesting than the one we started out with  the scooby doo ish central plot is forgivable in a movie with so much visual verve  energetic action and a character so wondrously designed as baymax  on the high quality scale set by the disney animated features in their latest renaissance  this one doesn t quite measure up  but big hero 6 is sure to entertain millions of smart kids and their escort parents  it s not as lovely as pixar s best  or remotely as complex in its storytelling  but it makes for a refreshingly simple intro course on modern superhero movie tropes  the team behind big hero 6 clearly have good intentions  as well as being the smoothest operators around  the breakthrough star of the season is here  his name is baymax and he s impossible not to love  the 3 d animated big hero 6 would be a ton less fun without this irresistible blob of roly poly  robot charisma  big hero 6 s considerable graces as an animated film its fantastical layouts and bouncy sense of figure and motion are offset by its deficiencies as a second rate superhero flick  at times  big hero 6 gets a little too noisy for its own good  but that never manages to drown out its many quieter charms  big hero 6 qualifies as a better than average kids  movie with enough cross generational appeal to make it a fine choice for a family weekend matinee

1443,nas_time_is_illmatic_2014,time is illmatic is well informed but inessential  a making of featurette barely expanded to feature length at a trim 74 minutes  an essential celebration of the new york rapper s groundbreaking 1994 album  a strikingly photographed and genuinely revealing exploration of the early influences that formed one of the most distinctive voices in rap  flirts with glamorising the rags to rap to riches story  but in doing so stays true to its subject  as both an origin story about a great artist and a distillation of  80s urban blight  it s as breathless and real as any street corner rhyme  the camera roams the way the human eye would  yet it knows the power of stillness  of letting the image linger and rest  these documentarians masterfully construct their vision to elevate and serve their subject  despite some conventional moves here and there and a weakness for the cult of genius  the documentary sustains that uneasy mood cast by nas s expression as a child on the  illmatic  cover  sobered by experience and wisdom before his time  the portrait misses out on discussing cultural impact  but the trade off is a full bodied tale of bootstrapping  sure to turn on any budding artist in the audience  the film understands that the most interesting thing about nas is how he once converted 20 years of living into 40 minutes of art that transcends its genre  its era  even its medium  while the trivia value may feel tremendous  only one9 s interviews with nas  his father  olu dara  and his brother  jungle  manage to make the doc legitimately moving  a history lesson in popular culture  it aims small and never veers off task  whether or not you dig the album  the documentary offers a number of reasons to appreciate its ongoing legacy  with sufficient production values to hold the tribute together

1445,how_to_train_your_dragon_2,the characters in this movie are charmers  they ve got me so well trained  i m even looking forward to httyd3  the filmmakers borrow freely from avatar  sword in the stone and even brave but they bring enough vigour and imagination to their storytelling to get away with it  this swooping and soaring sequel boasts big thrills  innovative set pieces and a surprisingly radical political outlook  hats off to dreamworks for offering some bold surprises in a respectable sequel filled with moments of humour and emotion among its ample noise and movement  game of what  this is our new desert island dragon themed pop pick  those who made  this film  know the kids who adored the original have grown since the  first one  and they re trying mightily to grow with them  that counts for something in today s popular culture universe  even if they seem to be trying awfully hard  overlong and overly busy but more emotionally powerful than its predecessor  the most distinctive thing about the series is its strictly rational handling of fantasy themes  the dragons themselves can be fearsome or adorable   but since they don t speak  they re treated for the most part as pieces of hardware or beasts of burden  although there are times when bits of the movie feel extraneous  the production as a whole comes across more like an organic extension of the original tale than something tacked on purely to score at the box office  despite its expanded  ambitious battle sequences  dragon 2 is at its best when it quiets down and dares to be intimate  one of the most beautiful animated films ever made  
1446,frank_2014,the movie s hipness quotient far outweighs its laugh quotient  though there s really no limit to the amusement of seeing someone bump around blindly in an oversize head  
1447,20000_days_on_earth,forsyth and pollard are visual artists turned filmmakers and their fine feel for the romantic possibilities of lighting and composition shape every frame  they re less sensitive to the line that separates drama from pretentiousness  flits between handsome neo noir pastiche and ripe psychological melodrama  
1448,pride_2014,even the most cynical viewer will find it hard not to get goosebumps as the unlikely allies pull off a rousing rendition of  solidarity forever   small moments of thoughtless homophobia and union bashing stick in the craw  successfully engendering empathy across apparently wide distances  this film moves effortlessly from some pretty intense dramatic moments to hilarious scenes showcasing the contrasting lifestyles of the gay and straight worlds to some vignettes of incredible poignancy  this portrayal of the unlikely 1980s alliance between london gay rights activists and striking welsh miners is  quite simply  one of the best movies of the year so far  pride offers all the virtues we expect from an english comedy  it s dry  surprising  compassionate  politically savvy  emotionally rewarding and stacked to the gills with great actors doing solid work  warchus really knows how to stage musical theater for the movies  he makes you want to dance  more amazing  however  is that he also makes you want to vote  pride takes a footnote in the history of britain s crippling yearlong industrial action and gives it a human face  simultaneously touching and funny while being relevant to current events and respectful of the issues involved  it s a feel good movie that does more than temporarily lift your spirits   it makes you feel a little better about the world  and about our capacity to set aside differences and clasp hands  a zesty tale of common cause that bursts at the seams with fine performances  
1449,manakamana,i ve never seen anything like it  manakamana is both calming and imagination sparking  forcing viewers to look at human faces for 10 minute stretches  whether those faces are talking excitedly or quietly looking around  
1450,stranger_by_the_lake,a stunning minimalist erotic thriller that explores with arresting photography and economical use of dialogue how human identity is defined  and sometimes imprisoned  by our desires  drives  and passions  carefully and often brilliantly creates its own eden like universe  what sets the engrossing  stranger by the lake  apart is that its excesses seem to point to a moral purpose beyond shock or entertainment value  claire mathon s brilliant cinematography finds an appositely sinister glare in the shimmering water and sunny skies  it shimmers with that intoxicating sun on the water allure that might make someone not quite themselves  a simple and ruthlessly effective exercise in minimal narrative and style  alain guiraudie s moral tale is so restrained and atmospheric that the nudity and graphic sex don t upstage the creepy mood of seductive  inescapable doom  movies must go somewhere  plots must always kick in  and when this one does  that s where  stranger by the lake  begins to contract into something less creative than its odd setting and compelling compositions would suggest  guiraudie questions the limits of heedless sexual indulgence at the expense of all other considerations  writer director alain guiraudie has an imagistic talent for suspense and erotic byplay  the film is a hitchcockian murder story in which the hitchcockian elements style as well as content are stood on their heads in order to realize a philosophical vision that s no less sophisticated than hitchcock s own  
1451,particle_fever,the film may not put itself above the uninitiated  but director mark levinson oftentimes appears almost too eager to present his material with affectation  
1452,the_last_of_the_unjust,each viewer will judge its truth for themselves  but the director s compassionately unsentimental acceptance is clear and profound  the 89 year old director has lost none of his bold inquisitiveness in a shoah follow up that plunges the viewer deep into the hustle and anguish of the czech ghetto  a historical restoration for a modern day reckoning  watching the film is like entering a labyrinth  following a winding thread of story that seems unlikely ever to come to an end  lanzmann organizes the material achronologically  presenting murmelstein s narrative out of order and intercutting it with footage of theresienstadt shot in 2012  this complex structure evokes a sense of moral vertigo that s nearly impossible to shake  those who think this is a black and white issue will be surprised  as lanzmann himself appears to have been  by what is said here  the new film may not qualify for masterpiece status  but it s an enthralling portrait of a man an exceptionally brilliant and articulate man who personified the courage  complexity and moral ambiguity of his tortured time  murmelstein deserves his own movie and now  more than 20 years after his death  he gets it  a powerful reflection on the beginning of hitler s final solution is seen through the intelligent  sardonic eyes of an aged eyewitness  another demanding and deeply rewarding investigation into the holocaust from documentarian claude lanzmann   lanzmann s  documentary doesn t deserve an audience so much as demand one  my hunch is that most viewers  whatever their previous views on this fraught subject  will come away not only fascinated but largely convinced by murmelstein  who comes across as extremely intelligent  self aware  sincere and honest     
1453,foxcatcher,while the acting is mostly impressive  the ending of the film leaves much to be desired as screenwriters e  max frye and dan futterman s script simply flutters to a close without much of an impact  it imitates deliberately the pace of wrestling where nothing happens for ages  bar imperceptible shuffling and nudging  until suddenly someone wins  tatum is on searing form  and carrell really knocks it out of the park with his first straight dramatic role  foxcatcher is brilliantly acted and extremely well crafted in a wintry  slow burning way but has an emptiness at its core  it is tautly directed  deftly written  thoroughly gripping and offers psychological heft as well as sublime performances all round  an exhilaratingly breathless experience  there s just no life in the film  aiming for a tone of studied foreboding  bennett miller instead sucks all the energy from his story  art can shape the truth in ways that resonate beyond the obvious  regrettably  the truth shaping here grapples for significance  without any apparent aim  if you re willing to be thrown for a loop  you re in good hands with this medal worthy cast and crew  the movie s bouts are hobbesian nasty  brutish  and short  and who wins has little or nothing to do with the olympic virtues preached every four years  by the end  it s evident that the filmmakers feel the same way about the american class system  
1454,national_gallery,we re used to documentaries having a pedagogical or activist itinerary  but wiseman s have become fastidiously unpedantic    his simple terence like interest in what other human beings do and how they do it is more than enough  
1455,the_drop,the film is just three degrees off being brilliant yet is always creepingly moving  and i loved its lived in squalor  it s a classic case of a little becoming a lot onscreen on the basis of a single impressive performance  for all its ponderous tone and pedigree  this remains lightweight stuff  rehashing familiar neo noir riffs while over exercising its central  dog s life  metaphor  there s something especially poignant about watching an actor who is no longer with us doing  one final time  what he did best  surprisingly  the interchanges between gandolfini and hardy compare favourably with those between rod steiger and marlon brando in on the waterfront  it is a gripping drama  showing how crime is partly a planned and intelligible activity  in which gangsters ruthlessly prosecute clearly defined interests  but also partly random  irrational and almost arbitrary  give it a go if only to see gandolfini shine one last time  the cute puppy almost steals the show but hardy is ace and quite the watchable chameleon in his surprising switch from lovable dumb ox to cannier than we thought  you have to sit through the slow parts to savor the cool parts  the movie s little surprise is that you didn t waste your time watching it  you were just being primed for an explosion of low volume and high impact  the entire film vibrates with understated tension  but almost never raises its voice above a hissed threat or a discomfited mutter  the drop s unpredictability is organic rather than sensationalistic  the movie doesn t pull surprises out of thin air for the sole purpose of shocking an audience   it lets them develop naturally  
1456,the_rocket,over produced and shamelessly manipulative  the rocket employs a cringe inducing score that cues every desired audience response  including unalloyed uplift at the end  try not to fall off the edge of your seat during the film s nail biting final scenes  it is a likable piece of work whose gentleness is an interesting contrast to the grim and even tragic subject matter  it follows a search for personal salvation while painting a portrait of laotian life that s both revealing and relatable  a powerful  deeply moving drama about a young boy who comes to terms with the tragedies that have befallen his family by creating a thing of beauty   a gorgeous  high flying rocket emitting triumphant bursts of color   out of refuse left by the war  the particulars of laos s historical conflicts are sometimes only obliquely confronted  but the torrid past of covered up wars palpably echoes through the scarred yet majestic landscapes  disamoe demonstrates the resourcefulness he learned during a period when he was a street seller and beggar  it s his exuberant performance  as much as the pungently naturalistic setting  that lifts the rocket s scenario above the generic  a coming of age tale infused with fantastic elements that more than compensate for its predictability  kim mordaunt s when life gives you land mines tale is light on well drawn characters  but its performances  especially from the nonprofessional junior members  more than light the fuse for the finale  the adventures of a 10 year old laotian boy are subject to radically different interpretations in the rocket  australian documentarian kim mordaunt s impressive narrative debut  
1457,last_days_in_vietnam,the film is rich in archival memory and first person recollections of many key figures  of higher and lower or no rank at all  archived film of the final  chaotic push to clear the embassy compound by helicopter is as dramatic as any thriller  heightened by stories of bravery and risk  a testament to people  as one source puts it   doing their best under terrible circumstances   this is both a gripping suspense story and a profound moral drama   last days in vietnam  will be broadcast in april on the long running pbs series  american experience   but it holds up on a bigger screen and deserves a large audience earlier than that  there is enough triumph and tragedy and heroism and heartbreak here to fill three or four features  but director rory kennedy smartly packs everything into just 98 minutes  and so captures the rushed  chaotic  just keep going feel of those dark days  sometimes the stories we think we know  the stories where we don t want to hear another word  turn out to be the most involving of all  the ones we in fact know the least about  so it is with  last days in vietnam   by turning her attention to an underreported chapter in recent history  kennedy has found a trove rich with unreal imagery and stories of heroism in the face of defeat  as great documentaries do   last days in vietnam  humanizes events that can seem merely factual in news reports and textbooks  one of the things that makes kennedy s film so powerful is that it s not just a story of stupidity and tragedy and incompetence  although there s more than enough of those qualities to be found in the history of america s vietnamese misadventure  perhaps the most striking thing about  last days in vietnam   rory kennedy s eye opening documentary about the 1975 evacuation of the american embassy in saigon  is how calmly it surveys what was once among the angriest topics in american political life  
1458,obvious_child,beyond the identity politics and humor  obvious child goes the extra mile to represent a seldom voiced  moderate position about a hot button topic  it doesn t overtly try to be anything more than what it is  which makes it that much more cool to watch  robespierre s direction of the many fine actors she assembled is assured  her sense of pacing nicely loose limbed  this generous  hilarious character study suggests jenny slate has more still to offer  hats off to any film that tries  and succeeds  at presenting challenging  off putting characters from whose palms i m reluctantly persuaded to eat  somehow it all still works  obvious child is like one of those kid s paintings where the riot of irreconcilable elements is unified by the charm and madness of a skilled naivety  despite a few too cute moments  the movie is both smarter and more sympathetic than that glib shorthand  writer director robespierre s low budget comedy drama is both caustic and heartfelt  in obvious child  stand up comedian jenny slate plays stand up comedian donna stern  a brooklyn hipster who puts absolutely no filters between her most intimate  embarrassing thoughts and her shtick on stage  obvious child s radicalism lies in its lack of radicalism  there is no grandstanding in the manner of if these walls could talk  no naughty trolling  la sarah silverman  just reading about this film will make some people feel sick  i adored it  robespierre and slate deserve credit for nudging the abortion narrative away from scaremongering horror  and back towards  if not an entirely happy ending  then at least something a girl might get a joke or two out of  sharp  funny and feeling  this isn t just juno meets girls but a smart film that tackles real life issues with rare frankness  
1459,dear_white_people,despite the chances not taken in terms of storytelling and filmmaking  there are also plenty of reasons to be excited about dear white people  simien took what started out as a crowd funded film and turned it into a pop culture phenomenon     the film explores how two members of the same race can have vastly different experiences depending on how dark their skin is  as well as why certain people can say and act one way  but not others  a brilliant piece of writing from a very thoughtful and humorous director  a dagger sharp satire  a film filled end to end with tiny sticks of dynamite  each lit carefully with a gleeful smirk  here s a film that refreshingly acknowledges various elephants in cinema s crowded living room  racism  the interracial sex taboo and class war  there s a lot in this prickly  snappily written feature debut that s as invigorating as early spike lee  do the right thing   take a break from summer spectacle to check out this assured and eloquent indie  dear white people has its share of provocations about race but complex reality has overtaken its vision at a worrying speed  the best moments get to the heart of simien s thesis that what is supposed to be post racial america isn t all that much different from what came before  a timely and important look at black identity and how it s informed by by stereotypes in the media where it scores big is its wealth of ideas visual  emotional  cultural and its deep well of bitter  voice of experience rage screenplay is tight  funny  smart and insightful  and  the  direction has just enough indie feel without becoming too self conscious or preachy  welcome to the head spinning gamesmanship of the obama era   and to the most elegantly candid comedy of racial tension since spike lee burst onto the scene 30 years ago  
1460,housebound,housebound is writer director gerard johnstone s only feature film  but its unique tone has the confidence of an established  more experienced screenwriter o reilly is terrific as the sneery discontent at the centre of the madcap maelstrom  while rima te wiata walks a wonderfully fine line between pathos and aggravation as the long suffering insufferable mum whose forced smile is about to crack  housebound does ghosts in the walls with the same wacky panache as the recent wyrmwood did aussie zombies  housebound winningly sticks two fingers up to tired genre persuasions  effecting a barnstorming crowdpleaser populated by people you want to root for and tension you can chew  it s the stuff friday nights at the movies were made for  first time director gerard johnstone may not possess the wild visual invention of his patron peter jackson  but he s ruthlessly proficient at old school scares  an extremely confident and promising debut  if housebound is ultimately much more funny than scary  it s because o reilly s pugnacious performance runs so counter to the genre s usual treatment of women in peril  the score is suitably ominous with the requisite screeching strings and plinking piano  and the cinematography recalls early sam raimi  a marvelously entertaining combo of haunted house thriller  murder mystery and domestic comedy  housebound marks a mighty impressive feature bow for kiwi scripter helmer editor gerard johnstone  you grow to feel as if you re arbitrarily changing the channel back and forth from a diverting horror film to a promising odd couple comedy  
1461,the_dance_of_reality,at first the film seems overly stagey  and those with little time for circus acts may find it irritating  but when jodorowsky hits his surreal stride  you may not know what to think of it  but you ll be glad that it exists  say this about the godfather of midnight movies  alejandro jodorowsky  he loves a parade and he puts on a doozy the loony goony visuals are still in play  but there s a sympathy for the audience  a desire to put things to good and even meaningful use  whatever childhood traumas jodorowsky may need to exorcise are ultimately subsumed by the movie s wild invention and carnivalesque cheer  the filmmaker s novel approach to memoir deserves a wider audience  maybe everything has been done before  but never quite like this  it may hold some interest to cinephiles as a relic of a kind of extravagant  overheated personal cinema that doesn t exist anymore  one of the most unforgettable films of this or any other year in recent memory  
1462,calvary_2013,i imagine most people will watch the film and merely see the village as populated by vivid eccentrics  but a closer look at these odd  bitter  hostile characters will suggest something darker at work  
1463,the_normal_heart,matt bomer is heartbreaking as a new york times style reporter looking for love in a loveless city  his physical transformation is astonishing and agonizing  you will learn lessons that should not be forgotten about the fear  foolishness  prejudice and intentional blindness that doomed millions to die who might otherwise have been saved  but the anger that lesson should provoke is either muted or missing  
1464,diplomatie,what gly lacks in historical fidelity he gains in dramatic interplay between men who held power very differently  
1465,the_guest_2014,a slow burn approach seems to pose a challenging change up for the filmmakers  who struggle to build tension as the second acts stretches well past the point when the level of menace should be escalating  wickedly entertaining  picture commando as a psychological thriller  imagine halloween as a theme park ride  think drive as a comedy  enjoyable horror lite  shot in lurid colors and drizzled with a squelchy synthesizer score  adam wingard s bloody thriller is so enamored of john carpenter it might as well be passing him mash notes in social studies  the guest borrows from other genre pictures with such intelligence and clarity of purpose  it manages to feel fresh  exciting  the pleasures of the guest lie mainly in anticipating how the next expected corner will be turned  nothing can stop the wicked smoulder of stevens  who makes a smile seem like a weapon of mass destruction  the guest ravels smartly  and  after too many herky jerky entries in the faux found footage subgenre  it s nice to see a scare film with a pearly visual style  which gives the enterprise the patina of both elegance and plausibility  the guest isn t here to deliver an earnest social message about the state of veterans  affairs  instead  the way good horror movies do  it channels our collective fear  guilt  and rage by creating a monster  the guest transcends the genre with characters who could have come out of a more serious movie  when they re in peril  we actually care  that s a familiar setup  but barrett and wingard take it in one unexpected direction after another  displaying obvious pleasure in their mad dash to keep topping themselves

1468,childs_pose,another powerfully observed romanian drama  razvan radulescu s screenplay is rich in irony and reversals  highlighting tensions between generations  and between the wealthy elite and the people whose lives are blighted by the elite s unthinking behaviour and desperation to cling to its status  despite these effective touches  the film eventually becomes a bit monotonous  it s clear from very early on that cornelia is a terrible person  but this doesn t stop netzer from hammering home the point  netzer crafts not only a chilling story of family dysfunction  but also an illuminating look into the corruption and decay of the romanian bourgeoisie   without ever overplaying his hand  it all appears so effortless  when in fact it s so skillful  a fascinating  troubling and finally controversial portrait of maternal anxiety at its most smotheringly neurotic  a tour de force performance from gheorghiu carries this 2013 drama along  but radulescu provides the fine edge  noting how this lioness cloaks her selfish crusade in a plea for humanity  of all the great monster mothers in cinema history  cornelia keneres  luminita gheorghiu  who sets the standard that other performances should be judged by this year  ranks high on the list  calin peter netzer s terrific drama exemplifies many of the traits that have made the new wave of romanian cinema so fecund  it s well worth seeing  both for its merciless anatomization of the country s post ceausescu social order and for gheorghiu s stupendous central performance as a mother so monstrous she makes medea look like a pushover  if child s pose fails to live up to its indie intellectual veneer  it earns its keep through gheorgiu  whose cornelia is a triumph of subtle performance over crude conception  in the movie world  most national new waves don t last long  an exception is the romanian renaissance  which has featured first class movies now for more than a decade  writer director calin peter netzer s thin yet compelling movie is a family drama with elements of political theater and film noir  when the stars are aligned the writing and direction along with the stars in front of the camera a movie can put the most appalling characters on display and still make them engrossing

1475,shes_beautiful_when_shes_angry,a somewhat less than successful film  
1476,norte_the_end_of_history,powerful and humbling  this 2013 drama is worth every minute you re willing to give it  a political and spiritual parable  but related with such subtle realism and incantatory rhythms that it is far more mysterious than didactic  if the movie s universal themes don t impress  its specific details do  as is often the case with three hour plus projects  a sense of stockholm syndrome kicks in  leaving us happy to roll along with real time rhythms of meals and walks and chores  diaz s most vocal fans do him no favours in this regard  he might become a better  more self critical director if people stopped reassuring him that every new film he makes is a deathless masterpiece  filipino maven diaz delivers a bravura  literary human drama that does justice to its great source material  masterly elements  for sure  spurts of vivid violence and dialectical debate  there are moments of staggering beauty and power on display here and yet there are also moments when it seems to be ambling around with no clear idea of where it wants to go  norte is formidable cinema that doesn t shy away from exploring history  philosophy  politics and religion at length  but it s also a story of three individuals  through whom these topics gain sharper focus  any thought of diaz as a director who makes it all up as he goes along is comprehensively belied by a tightly structured narrative that  for all its length and languid pacing  contains very little dead time  you d have to go back to edward yang s yi yi to find a movie that approaches marathon length running times yet still makes you wish it were twice as long  
1477,mistaken_for_strangers,it s an uneven affair  embraced as unguardedly  intimate  by some fans of the band  but in reality less moving than anvil  the story of anvil  and lacking the objective insight of terry zwigoff s oddly comparable crumb  we loved every minute of tom s company and his film  right down to halford s o holy night over the closing credits  one of the most hilarious  honest films about two brothers you re ever likely to see  it could easily have been a workaday music doc  but amid all the gigs  pit stops and sound checks emerges a funny and wry story of brothers at work  a teasing essay on sibling tensions     a backdrop for a gonzo self portrait  a likeably self deprecating music biz counterpart to louis c k  s tv shows  mistaken for strangers finds its footing in humor and good nature  and it s a thoroughly feel good rock documentary with massive audience appeal  national fans or not  for all their obvious differences  the bond between affable tom and laser intense matt reveals itself in ways both subtle and profound  you don t have to be a fan of the band to be touched by these disparate souls  it does help if you have endured or been either version of these brothers black sheep or golden child

1479,tims_vermeer_2014,it s obvious in hindsight why penn and teller would be so drawn to this ethereally beautiful mystery  their passion for all things seemingly magical  often mechanical  and always amazing is practically their trademark  we should never forget that penn and teller are professional bamboozlers  and their attempt to re frame the definition of genius might be nothing but smoke and mirrors  unexpectedly dazzling   tim s vermeer  makes a convincing case that vermeer could have painted the way jenison says he did  it also makes a pretty powerful ancillary point  that some people are both geniuses and geeks  an improbable subject has inspired a unique documentary which comes with an unusual pedigree  it was produced by those inventive magicians penn and teller  and directed by teller  jenison s obsession is the basis for a playful entertaining film  i wasn t convinced for a millisecond by his wackadoodle theory  but i enjoyed every minute of tim s vermeer  art purists can relax since  inventor tim  jenison  a video wiz with little talent for painting  never really challenges vermeer s genius for conception and composition  technology is the thing at issue here

1483,the_dog_2014,try as you may  however  you can t turn away from this obscure footnote in pop culture history  even at his most aggravating  it s that twisted thing we call celebrity  sidney lumet s oscar winning dog day afternoon was based on a true story   and john wojtowicz doesn t even try to hide his glee in sharing every juicy  crazed detail in revealing documentary  the dog  the result does justice to their subject s foul mouthed charm and braggadocio  in numerous interviews that careen from profane braggadocio to tender reminiscence  the lustily bisexual wojtowicz comes across as almost bizarrely self satisfied  the film keeps you riveted  yet its achievement is finally more humanistic than cinematic  it ll leave you alternately amused and slack jawed in astonishment  the film is a real  whew  factor yarn  a hearty soup of thick accents  bold personalities and complicated motives  with an unmistakable taste of charismatic  ornery american hedonism  part of what makes mr  wojtowicz such a fascinating character is that he seemed to rotate identities as easily as other people change socks  and without angst  for all its eye opening material  the dog still feels unfinished  but for students of new york scuzziness  it s an essential addition  what makes the dog so compelling isn t wojtowicz s cinematic imprint but the place in history that was very likely denied him by chance and his own irascibility  it s informed with a subtle but disquieting subtext that insists on the pitfalls of allowing ideology to steer you away from common sense  working as both an unofficial dog day sequel and unconventional overview of new york gay culture from the past 40 years  the dog combines archival footage  still photographs  and testaments from many of those who knew wojtowicz well  how often hollywood embellishes  how rare  then  to find a documentary like the dog  in which we discover that  if anything  sidney lumet s dog day afternoon left out much of the incredible story behind its 1972 hostage crisis

1486,the_skeleton_twins,despite occasional charming moments and a generally solid ensemble  the skeleton twins doesn t distinguish itself in any memorable way  suicide is no laughing matter  but there are some wry smiles in this changeably moody indie pic about self destructive siblings  how can you not love something that gives wiig so much scope  there is the risk of a credibility gap when charismatic and successful stars play ultra  dysfunctional types  that s why bill hader and kristen wiig never quite convince as milo and maggie  twins on the cusp of middle age  the laughs are here  but they are tempered by bruising regrets and simmering grudges in this elegant study of a sibling relationship in crisis  a bold experiment which doesn t quite come together  an engaging comedy drama lifted by two revelatory performances  wiig in particular suggests an academy award winner in waiting  the surprising thing about this above average relationship movie is its sense of humour  something you wouldn t necessarily expect from a drama that starts with attempted suicide  johnson s unfussy direction serves as a fine showcase for the two snl veterans to demonstrate how their comic shorthand plays equally well in a slightly darker register  if a movie with suicide as a central theme can be deemed funny  then writer director craig johnson has pulled it off  mixing heartache and humor and giving wiig  especially  the opportunity to shine  it s worth a watch to see these two reliably comic actors do some heavy dramatic lifting and tenderly spot for each other  
1487,top_five,rock s crass reliance on misogynist hooker gags and hot sauce up the ass homophobia routines means that an adam sandler cameo hardly seems out of place  for an ostensibly soul deep movie like this to work  we need more than smirks and scowls  
1488,venus_in_fur,lighthearted as it is  venus in fur has the rare effect of filtering the viewer s life through its own extreme lens  while the extraordinarily talented polish born director rarely falters in translating the source s theatrical strengths  his venus in fur feels oddly impersonal  lacking the trademark touch of polanski perversity  what plays out is roller coaster ride of shifting identity and sexual brinkmanship   mischievous and sadistic by turns  it becomes a deadly serious battle of the sexes  venus in fur is essentially a weightless skit  a parody of those hoary old archetypes of man and woman  but it s also a tribute to seigner  who seizes the gift of a role that allows her to be sexy  funny and imposing  wickedly smart and wickedly playful  roman polanski s adaptation of david ives  tony nominated venus in fur works on so many levels  it s almost dizzying  whether you like it or not  roman polanski is a great artist  and even the minor films of his fugitive decades glimmer with the claustrophobia and sardonic bleakness of his greatest work  one thing that makes the dialogue heavy movie so compelling  and also something that polanski does so well  is an undercurrent of dread  maybe you see where all this is going  but even if you do  getting there is still good  queasy fun  the couple s movie long pas de deux  during which time a reversal of roles takes place and the inner thomas is exposed to the world  us   is staged with delicious irony and ingenuity by mr  polanski the film has a creepy allure but  as movies featuring full bore sexual gamesmanship often do  it wears thin  ever the alchemist  roman polanski continues his quest for the process whereby theatre is transmuted and reforged into film  roman polanski s been making films about psycho sexual mind games for decades  and when his opening shot poses his stage director next to a very phallic cactus  you know he s at it again  if you didn t see the play onstage and don t know what you re missing  this venus in fur has its demonic  masochistic charms  
1489,art_and_craft,the constant scrutiny of a camera seems exploitative and cruel  even if you are at all suspicious when he rationalizes his behavior as childlike mischief  this crazy gazing docu never presumes to be much more than an extended version of the kind of story one might expect to see briefly spotlighted on 60 minutes  even so  all sorts of interesting questions swirl beneath the surface  deeply eccentric subject makes for an engaging art doc  
1490,closed_curtain,anoher self reflexive piece of house arrest theater that edges more ambitiously into fiction or at least the blurry line between reality and creative fantasy 
1491,the_case_against_8,a sprawling yet engrossing documentary about the five year court battle to overturn california s ban on gay marriage  known as proposition 8  
1492,the_kill_team,it offers a deep  troubling probe into a military culture that both incubates horrifically criminal acts against innocents and throws innumerable obstacles in the paths of soldiers who would thwart or report those outrages  
1493,the_trip_to_italy_2014,this hedonistic japery is shot through with middle aged melancholy and the fear of death  by the time coogan is addressing brydon as yorick in a skull filled catacomb outside naples  the film s true subject has been made as crystal clear as the case surrounding a lava crusted corpse in old pompeii  
1494,night_moves_2013,so much potential overshadowed by poor execution that begs the all important question  why should we care  succeeds mightily when it comes to creating tension but struggles a little more with making its plot run together smoothly  night moves calls us  inadvertently or not  to reconsider our definition of what s  natural   certainly  some of the ways we ve failed to care for the planet as we were charged back at the beginning have had dire consequences  let s not ignore that  reichardt and regular co writer jon raymond display a keen ear for the fragile rhetoric of the self righteous  reichardt probes away at her characters  motivations and contradictory feelings  she doesn t judge them  but makes it very clear how quickly their idealism becomes muddied once they dirty their hands with direct action  taking her cues from hitchcock  reichardt invites us to connect  if not quite empathise  with unlikable characters as they attempt to accomplish undesirable outcomes  all three leads are perfect  here s how good a filmmaker kelly reichardt is  she can pack an entire movie s worth of meaning into a sliver of onscreen space  and do it so subtly that even attentive viewers might miss the trick  gripping  smart and well tooled  this greenies on a mission movie gives terrific build up and a riveting central set piece  with only a slight dip at the end  
1495,disneynature_bears,sincere and unexpectedly good  the film happily reintroduces another element of classic kids  movies  a tidy 77 minute run time  the devotion and persistence of these animals is a powerful reminder that family connections link all species  with this peek into their world  we are more aware of our own  if the sight of bear cubs prancing through wildflowers doesn t make you smile  then you probably won t like the new disneynature documentary bears  you also probably aren t human  an enjoyable and visually stunning romp through the scenic alaskan wilderness with a small family of bears  the astounding footage of a mother bear and two cubs fishing  fighting and hanging tough through a challenging year of foraging transcends the folksy narration  the disneynature movies shouldn t be mistaken for traditional documentary  but if they act as a gateway drug for young children to learn more about the animal kingdom  then the films are serving a real purpose  a formulaically entertaining combination of gorgeous cinematography and unapologetic anthropomorphization  although bears doesn t have a stated green message  it s hard to see the majestic natural beauty presented onscreen and not feel stewardship urges  there s only so much editing can do to make a bear story seem like a human one  and the filmmakers  alastair fothergill and keith scholey directed  also go to unfortunate lengths to give human characteristics like laziness to the bears  
1496,cheap_thrills_2013,a bluesy drinking session evolves into messy violence for kicks in this nifty debut feature from e l katz  
1497,grzeli_nateli_dgeebi,the directors stay close on their characters and let scenes play out in handheld long takes  so that the miseries inflicted never feel distant or clinical  but immediate  
1498,to_be_takei,another pleasant if disposable portrait  director jennifer kroot s good natured biography is so appealing that even non trekkies may be convinced we needed a full length documentary about the man who was sulu  
1499,the_theory_of_everything_2014,it s all slavishly conformed into a woefully predictable formula  as inflexible as the meet cute rom com or the superhero epic  every scene less about capturing a moment from a life than about completing a checklist  the theory of everything may not tear a rip in the cinematic space time continuum  but as an intimate drama about two people struggling with a life they never expected  it has real power  watching him  eddie redmayne  slumped in an electric wheelchair  simulating the effects of hawking s motor neurone disease  it s easy to forget you re looking at an actor  there s a mischievous quality to redmayne that seems a good match with the wit hawking has always managed to convey with a raised eyebrow and a mechanically voiced quip  if the film unfolds like a fairytale  at least it s a fairytale that doesn t often get told  there s little acrimony in the theory of everything  which may reflect hawking s actual outlook or just the movie s puppyish desire to please  director marsh is a gifted documentarian  but at this point  his dramatic technique is too shallow to get inside his characters  heads  what shines through loud and clear  though  is the humanity in hawking s incredible story  despite its title  the theory of everything is less about astrophysics and more about the quantum mechanics of human relationships under pressure  how jarring to see a film so devoid of conflict  tension or struggle  redmayne s quietly exuberant performance is admirable and engaging  never over stressing its tour de force dimension  but the real colour is brought by felicity jones as jane     marsh and cinematographer beno t delhomme s exquisite harnessing of light and the former s guiding of jones and redmayne to performances of surpassing delicacy elevate such passages to something beyond douglas sirk  a well made  well acted but unexceptional film about one of the most exceptional figures of the last half century  
1500,mad_max_fury_road,a machine that roars at full throttle for two solid hours  george miller s mad max  fury road upends all expectations about how action sequences are composed  what themes a blockbuster can contain  or who a film s actual protagonist can be and puts most other filmmakers working on this scale to shame  there s an amazing sense of scale and depth to the cinematography by john seale  who came out of retirement for this one  and also a brilliantly varied color palette  fury road  despite its lack of an interesting plot  despite the absence of flesh and blood characters  despite the basic sameness of any sequel  still manages to thrill  even after two viewings  i feel as though i ve only scratched the surface of mad max  fury road  george miller s action fantasy is astonishingly dense for a big budget spectacle  not only in its imagery and ideas but in the complex interplay between them  to think that this furious  fuming  freaky world should have been created by a man in his 70s  the same guy who warmed the cockles of our heart with happy feet and babe  is unbelievable  fury road is a defiantly individual riposte to those committee led blockbusters which are built on cgi and designed to sell toys  an orgy of loud and louder  leaving us alternately exhilarated  exasperated and exhausted  believe all the hype  this movie will melt your face off  in fury road there is nothing pacifist or even docile in miller s conception of the nature of the feminine  no matter what they look like or what they are wearing  i saw it twice and liked it vastly more the second time around  when i d adjusted my expectations and had my bearings from the get go  then it became about digging the spectacle   not to mention the hilarious sexual politics  an a plus b movie that at times feels almost like a tone poem to early  80s excess  a cross between a monster truck rally and a plasmatics concert  a gorgeous  scrap metal demolition derby of a popcorn picture  
1501,inside_out_2015,with its quite literally cerebral bent  i think inside out might have some trouble fully connecting with younger kids  but grown ups are likely to shed more than a few tears and give some knowing nods as this wistful little film plays out  this breakthrough cartoon attacks enforced happiness and optimism the white bread and butter of american family movies  
1502,spotlight_2015,spotlight manages the seemingly impossible task of wooing journalists with authenticity while still elevating reporters to hero status  as they battle a formidable and corrupt institution with righteous determination  ruffalo gets top billing in the movie  and he brings some wonderfully lived in behavioral details to his performance    the quick  terrier like movements of the head and the bitten off sentences  spotlight giving center stage to unsung warriors for truth who understood telling the story right  without embellishment  without melodramatic editorial excess  was the greatest victory of them all  ultimately  the story these journalists chased was about how institutional power degrades when it gets taken for granted  the uniformly strong ensemble cast largely avoids any grandstanding moments  and manufactured drama is swerved  while howard shore s sober score is applied with restraint  the sense we have is of dedicated professionals getting the job done with the minimum of egotism or indulgence  a grown up film about serious people that mercifully escapes any awards grabbing platitudes  this is more thrilling than most action movies  an extraordinary paean to journalistic endeavour  this might just be the best newspaper film since all the president s men in 1976  the title suggests a beam of illumination but spotlight has the dimmer switch turned low  
1503,star_wars_episode_vii_the_force_awakens,despite the copious servings of tragic threats and good feelings  the production sinks under the weight of its emotional calculation  it all comes together nicely as the actors breathe vulnerability  fallibility and personality into their roles  with daisy ridley being quite the commanding presence  my favourite  hands down  is the cute and rotund droid bb 8  that s what s so impressive about the tricky balancing act abrams has pulled off with the force awakens  he s made a movie that s simultaneously gripping and a huge release  we are in good hands  at last  i found myself listening to a chorus of spontaneous gasps  cheers  laughs  whoops and even occasional cries of anguish  what s really surprising is that many of them were coming from me  with the force awakens  abrams has begun one of the most important reclamation projects of our time  the complete erasure from cultural memory of the phantom menace and its sequels  there are no glaring missteps in the force awakens  and on such a stage this kind of performance might even pass for greatness    for a little while  but the movie can t sustain its playfulness or its tension  either  abrams is too busy trying to roll the original star wars and the empire strikes back into one two hour and 15 minute movie  as with other installments  this is less a movie than an exercise in massaging a juvenile minded audience that wants the experience to be new and familiar at the same time  as a nostalgia trip that knows exactly what die hard star wars fans want and then layers in some memorable new characters  the force awakens is exactly what it needs to be  an old school saturday afternoon sci fi matinee writ big  like their star wars forebears  boyega s finn and ridley s rey are brave  funny  and admirable but also imperfect  uncertain  and sometimes afraid  that is to say  they re genuine  multisided characters with believable motivations  
1504,brooklyn,brooklyn is marvelous  watching it as close to pure bliss as any cinematic confectionary treat as i could possibly have imagined myself  
1505,creed_2015,adonis and rocky make one of the year s best cinematic pairings  their transition from strangers to acquaintances to partners to friends to something so much more absolutely exquisite  creed is a sure fire hit that s impossible to hate but i may have to punch the next person who tells me it made them cry  surprisingly thoughtful and stylish  a shot of box fresh blood  if you can stomach the schmaltz and suspend your disbelief in the face of the film s pounding predictability  you ll find plenty to enjoy  anyone hoping the franchise might open out into new thematic territory will be disappointed  this is the same old ritual  from the amped up training sequences to the climactic title fight with its absurd number of punches landed in every round  creed packs a serious punch  replete with crunching fight sequences captured in a probing  prowling style  it s an invigorating piece of nostalgia that fuels a bigger adrenaline rush with its climax than any big budget blockbuster could provide  coogler keeps everything moving so gracefully that by the end of creed  we almost don t know what hit us  whether the credit goes to the director or the actor or both  this is the performance of stallone s career  one in which that age defying orange body stays covered up but his sadness is in full view  
1506,mission_impossible_rogue_nation,rogue nation is a 131 minute roller coaster ride that slows down long enough for you to catch your breath before jettisoning you into another gasping round of action and adventure  writer director christopher mcquarrie  whose action movie skills are at best high adequate  compensates by being good at interpersonal stuff  he can make us feel for the characters as something more than action toys  one or two seriously awesome moments aside  there s very little of note here  
1507,carol,iit makes me wish the word  epic  hadn t been completely diluted so i could bring the full weight of its meaning to bear on this love story  extraordinary  singular  remarkable  yes  all of those things too  the smile of recognition and understanding that closes things out is an unforgettable celebratory stunner that shook me right to my very core  never has the impossible glamour of cate blanchett been used to better effect than in todd hayne s ravishing and romantic carol  cate blanchett and rooney mara take us inside a passionate story of desire and retribution that s both satisfying and disturbing  haynes taps into universal anxieties about love and relationships without ever letting go of the sense of imprisonment that came with being gay in the 1950s  this is about two people who didn t know what their lives were until they met each other  then scrambling  in their muted  buttoned up way  to figure out what happens next  haynes loves them so much that he believes they can  you will too  as a love story this left me unsatisfied  though i enjoyed the lush period trappings and the flattering sense of how enlightened i am compared to people in the 1950s  the lesbian affair at its heart is rendered with intelligence and care  and if there are speeches to be made  they are happily few  and far more personal than political  cate blanchett is outstanding as a married woman who falls for a younger woman  as that younger woman  rooney mara is even better  in carol  all the elements dovetail perfectly to create a movie that is as irresistible as its title character  the movie has an allure that is almost trancelike  mimicking for the viewers the inescapable attraction experienced by the two main characters  
1508,the_martian,we are so used to sci fi movies in which the heroes shoot martians with ray guns that scott s botanical approach can t help but seem offbeat and refreshing  cynical as i am about how monster budget blockbusters have come to dominate the studio mind set  i can t imagine anyone not liking this one  
1509,room_2015,i remain struck by both the simplicity and tenderness of the narrative that is haunted by a deep tragedy  room takes a nightmarish premise in an impossibly contained set and turns it into one of this year s most emotionally poignant films  larson delivers every line to perfection and  as it happens  there s not one weak link in the cast  abrahamson has the intelligence to trust his cast to show us the world through their eyes  and oh  what a world it is  a soul stirring feel good weepie  room offers highly imaginative and  at times  visionary film making that transcends its claustrophobic settings and defies genre stereotyping  it s a story so abhorrent and seemingly hopeless that there may be times you don t want it to go on  but within its tight confines lenny abrahamson  with a script by emma donoghue  finds warmth and hope  it s a deeply satisfying  profoundly moving adaptation of a popular novel  an all too rare occurrence in modern hollywood  
1510,shaun_the_sheep_movie,another adorably quirky stop motion animated film from aardman  
1511,it_follows,it s hard not to share jay s mounting panic as she watches the thing in its various guises walking slowly toward her wherever she may be  invisible to everyone else and entirely intent on destroying her  
1512,spy_2015,feig keeps his spy machinery cranking so smoothly that nothing said or done feels as outrageous as  in fact  it is  the truth serum spy drops into our fizzy drinks makes us feel so good that we don t even realize we ve been schooled  generously cast  sharply scripted and often vigorously improvised  
1513,son_of_saul,it s an extraordinary method of making this unfathomable act personal  a formalist experiment that yields stunning emotional dividends  
1514,45_years,this story  which grows richer the more you think about it  is a rueful acknowledgment of the fact that few of us can  if the subject matter is familiar  haigh approaches it in good faith   avoiding both sentimentality and cynicism  and seeking out fresh insight rather than settling for cliche  the naturalistic approach of haigh and his actors makes 45 hours a memorable screen experience  filled with subtle details and clues to the relationship  what s the big deal  how does an entire film come of this  there are satisfying answers to these questions  but to state them would be to ruin a perfectly good movie  45 years exposes the paradoxical balance of the successful marriage  one that requires a sentimental suspension of disbelief on the one hand and a hard headed ability to deal with the everyday on the other  both actors deliver a master class in expression by understatement  the most unsettling of ghosts  we are moved to realize  are the ones we try hardest to deny  this is not an actual horror movie  but the tension grows so great in some scenes you might mistake it for one  haigh knows how to thread a story in a way that makes it feel deliberate and spontaneous  so that when it reaches its climax  viewers feel that it s both inevitable and utterly devastating  it s cathartic  and moving  without any of the usual obvious contrivances or manipulations  sometimes  just when you think you have things figured out  life throws a curve ball  
1515,amy_2015,guys  after watching the 128 minute film  i can honestly say that i have never seen a documentary that has turned me off so much as this one has

1517,paddington_2014,it manages to be both old fashioned and high tech  it remains faithful to the character s roots while also placing him firmly within a contemporary setting  it s charmingly funny and shamelessly punny  artfully and cleverly  the sweet spirit of that young bear from darkest peru and his many london misadventures materializes brilliantly on screen in the very good hands of writer director conjurer paul king  
1518,ex_machina,while some decisions made by characters in the final act feel rushed and even unwarranted  i was always interested to see where this story went  
1519,sicario_2015,an unforgettable motion picture that should be on the must see list for anyone who appreciates films that deal in grays rather than blacks and whites  within this dark epic of american failure lives an effective but decidedly minor vigilante flick  
1520,anomalisa,anomalisa is fascinating  and i cannot say i was ever bored by anything that kaufman and johnson were choosing to show me  by the time michael and lisa are up in that hotel room  trying so heroically to say the right thing  the picture has transcended its gimmicks  there s something magical about the malaise which raises this above mere misanthropy   a heightened sense of fragile life that perhaps only puppets could hope to achieve  though fellow fatalists woody allen  when in dostoevskian mode  and todd solondz occupy similar territory  the arrival of kaufman s stop motion drama anomalisa reiterates the uniqueness of  kaufman s  surreally skewed metaphysical inquiries  anomalisa is a reminder that animation can do much more than provide high jinks for a family audience  this is a surprisingly dark film  but it is a lyrical and insightful one  it delves into areas that even the frankest live action dramas shy away from  even in its apparently throwaway opening gag  anomalisa has human existence covered  no one would start a punch up if they said that the screenwriter charlie kaufman is the most original voice to emerge in us cinema since david lynch  the hell of other people fuses with the hell of loneliness in this strange miniature masterpiece from charlie kaufman  anomalisa has more heart  soul and pathos than 99 9 per cent of live action movies  the film refuses to settle on one interpretation  instead opening up a space for larger philosophical questions  kaufman s script stings with uncomfortable truths  but doesn t do much else  kaufman s medium has changed but his message is still the same  
1521,phoenix_2015,phoenix  christian petzold s meditation on individual and cinematic ouroboros  lands on blu ray with a masterful transfer from the criterion collection  this is cinema at its most ineffable and its most potent  both a powerful allegory for post war regeneration and a rich hitchcockian tale of mistaken identity  the personal drama is layered with subtle subtexts and the film evokes the work of those classic proponents of screen melodrama  douglas sirk and rainer werner fassbinder  in its combination of highly coloured glamour coating a very dark centre  everything in phoenix is designed to prepare us for the knockout ending  which couldn t be simpler in itself  but has the force of a long delayed emotional release  you may not buy all the story twists  but perhaps the script is not meant to be taken literally  hoss is perfect in a challenging role  a woman trying to recover bits of the person she once was  but having to do so in service to a greedy scheme that robs her of the very identity she is trying to recover   phoenix  takes its time and leaves us guessing until the final electrifying scene  the movie isn t a thriller  but it still generates a strange sort of emotional suspense   an incredibly intense drama that makes you hold your breath   phoenix  is an intoxicating witches  brew  equal parts melodrama and moral parable  that audaciously mixes diverse elements to compelling  disturbing effect  
1522,mustang_2015,employing a palette of simple yet elegant binary motifs   day night  light dark   erg ven constructs her own powerful and distinct emotional language through a confident and captivating formal style  i won t tell you how it ends  i will say you should see for yourself  there are so many remarkable things about this wonderful movie  erguven has a naturalistic style and doesn t seem too concerned with flash or wizardry  preferring to let the story and characters take centre stage  erguven is wisely determined to avoid any hint of melodrama  a superbly acted study of suppression that s more intent on provocation than plausibility  the giddy abandon of youthful pleasures are writ large across blissed out faces and fast mouths  the story moves at speed  with ergu ven constantly resisting the temptation to pause and wring sentiment from a dramatic development  deniz gamze ergven s brilliant  affecting academy award nominated drama  loosely based on her own upbringing  initially resembles the virgin suicides only to swerve into nail biting thriller terrain  ergven isn t peddling blind optimism so much as a realism animated by the belief that freedom far from being inevitable must be fought for  that it will be fought for  that there are five sisters allows erguven to explore the scenario s several possible outcomes  be it happy ending or tragedy or the bittersweet fates in between  part of a welcome international wave of films made by women directors that focus on girls growing up in worlds of men   and on what they look like when no one s looking  
1523,gett_the_trial_of_viviane_amsalem,the kind of tragic and absurd blend that can only be labeled as kafkaesque  a microcosm of women victimized by patriarchal institutions worldwide as well as an allegory of the universal struggle for freedom  as viviane laments  this kind of thing wouldn t happen in america  true  but there s not an actress in america who wouldn t twist her hair into a bun for the chance to play this role  it may puzzle audiences unfamiliar with the israeli system but the rigid religious bureaucracy devoted to keeping a married couple together at all cost makes for a superb way of adding layers of tension to this effective drama  elkabetz commands the screen whether she s quietly seething or lashing out at the judges and their pointed questions  her plight provides a painful argument that marriage   and divorce   are better served in the civil sphere  one feels the oppressiveness of israeli domestic law  but how one is supposed to feel about the subjects isn t clear  a highly compressed  exquisitely acted tale of two people who do not belong together plays out as a courtroom saga that  in story terms  runs longer than many marriages  this may not sound like the merriest way to spend time in a movie theater  but gett is compelling from its first frame  every shot  cut  line  performance  indeed every moment in this feature is perfectly judged  always conveying precisely what it needs to convey in to define its characters and move the story forward  gripping cinema from start to finish  almost implausibly so  this all might be laughable if it wasn t based on the very real facts of the israeli court system  which as portrayed here is like kafka without the surrealist trappings

1526,the_big_short,adam mckay s the big short plays like an elaborate con  albeit one that uses its powers for good  an unlikely but oddly effective mixture of dark comedy  character study  based on a true story drama  rabble rousing  and detective story  utterly engrossing  blending the insight of jc chandor s 2011 gem margin call with the satirical bite of po bronson s prophetic 1995 novel  bombardiers  confronting these facts while snorting at how funny this film often can be is quite confounding  mckay hasn t lost his touch as a director of comic performances  and the didactic format lets him shake off a lot of sodden hollywood convention  the characters aren t required to learn spiritual lessons or even be particularly likeable  the knowing  boisterous humour comes off as irredeemably smug and the a list cast can t disguise the fact that they are portraying points of view  rather than characters  lots of pleasant bluster  but spreads itself a little too thin  witty  absurd and far more entertaining than it has any right to be  this could finally shed light on the financial crisis for those of us who found it all too boring to contemplate  it wants you to leave the cinema not just fired up  but clued in  and goes to knowingly preposterous lengths to ensure it  the big short is the truth telling picture of the year  it puts beautifully shaded characters in guy comedy mode into an altman esque narrative  shot counter to type by ken loach s cinematographer  barry ackroyd

1528,tangerine_2015,i want to see these two actresses in other  better films  even if it s just to erase tangerine out of my head  they deserve better  tangerine takes you by the scruff of your neck into a parallel world where tattered reality is shot through with neon flashes of colour  clarity and pure emotional honesty  it radiates a candour  immediacy and tongue scalding sex appeal that a bigger budget would have only smothered  this is a one crazy night picture  a little like alex holdridge s la indie pic in search of a midnight kiss  from 2007  there s real energy  a dazzling bauble of melodrama and fast paced merriment  raucously entertaining  told with simplicity but deep empathy  baker s film sports a refreshingly sober  grown up worldview that refuses to judge  sensationalize  or do anything other than show lives as they may be  and perhaps are  baker gets great  sly  unforced performances from his two leads  but it s not all a rollicking good time  there are moments of quietude  inquietude  moments when a sense of wariness and loneliness settles over the women

1530,3_and_12_minutes_10_bullets,the film finds its biggest strengths in the quiet moments with davis s parents as they attempt to move through the grief of losing their only child  cleanly presented and crisply framed  each image is shot with a respectfully detached gaze  from the talking heads to the twisting floridian highways shot at golden hour  sadly  this means that silver s treatment of the case feels overly forensic  we must not just simply remember  we must stand up and demand our humanity  if we don t  we ve let jordan davis down and after seeing  3 1 2 minutes  10 bullets that is the last thing that you will want to do  silver remains exceptionally clear eyed  the result is a powerful  gripping and deeply shocking film  and a contemptuous critique of florida s stand your ground law  a uniquely compelling real life legal thriller  the straightforward  well edited trial scenes speak volumes  not only about the defendant  but also about the racism that still haunts our country  the heartache and outrage are there already  the movie wisely doesn t force it  it s told in a contemplative style that brings the story s emotions to life without hyping them  a barbed inquiry into this particular notion of  self defense   enabled by the quotidian racism state and perpetuated de jure by the state  
1531,the_diary_of_a_teenage_girl,with female sexuality onscreen  especially young women s  we re often presented with a binary  is it exploitative or empowering  damaging or liberating  depressing or joyful  the diary of a teenage girl asks why it can t be all of these things and more  the film is quietly radical not because it dares to rattle cages so much but because it doesn t  this is a story of huge emotions and big moments  told via intimate gestures and tiny power shifts  it s a gem  most crucially  heller is more interested in bearing witness to adolescent experience than passing judgment    and this approach extends to her handling of the adults around minnie  an honest and personal and unblurred examination  even through that druggy blur  of a tricky voyage into womanhood  seldom has teenage sexual awakening been covered from a female perspective   with a fickle alternating confidence  self doubt and voracious appetite   quite so frankly or delicately  there is a kind of achievement in depicting a sexual relationship between an adult man and his girlfriend s daughter in a way that makes it feel neither predatory nor twisted    whether it is a thing worth achieving is another question  expect to feel uncomfortable watching diary of a teenage girl  which is precisely the point of this finely etched debut feature by writer director marielle heller  it dares to show the heroine as something more complicated than a victim  as a result the movie lands somewhere outside the battle lines of contemporary gender politics  which may be why it feels true  for an industry that can barely manage to put women in leading roles  the diary of a teenage girl casts a sexually brash 15 year old as antihero  and succeeds  it s work  but it s ultimately rewarding work  it tackles some truths that other movies wouldn t touch  not even with a stick and thick gloves  
1532,about_elly,farhadi has written a first rate script  enabling intricate plotting to intertwine with well defined characters  and  about elly  shows him at ease with the wide variety of situations his writing explores  by the time the mystery is solved  it hardly seems to matter  what matters is the casual lack of honesty that almost everyone seems to depend on  there are no false notes anywhere in this cast of performers   a  suspenseful domestic intrigue deeply rooted in traditional iranian mores and social codes  a fascinating discovery from a filmmaker whose sensitivity to the most confounding motivations is equalled only by his compassion for those who succumb to them  about elly is an exploration of human nature and how sometimes  without intending to  we hurt the ones we love most   including ourselves  it has taken six years for this terrific film to work its way back to us  and if possible i think it s even better and more relevant in 2015 than when it was made  a thriller perched right on the fault line between modern thinking and islamic tradition  it s further confirmation of farhadi s peerless skills as a dramatist  with a special talent for drawing prismatic meaning from simple premises  this is clearly the work of a master in the making  an artist on the cusp of greatness  farhadi may be fixated on fibbers  but there s almost no one working today who makes films so emotionally honest  its belated appearance should be welcomed by cinephiles  as it offers solid proof of this writer director s distinctive gifts

1534,71_2015,there is a rich ethical murkiness that runs through this film on a near molecular level  and it strives to gets into the meat of what this kind of violent civil unrest and violence does to people  an impressive debut feature buoyed by a captivating central turn   71 makes so much effort to be suspenseful that it doesn t have much time to get into nuance  everyone has a least favorite bad dream  and hook s may be yours  the nightmare of being hopelessly lost in a place where time has stopped and hope has vanished  the film doesn t take sides  but shows how conflict stirs the pot of human emotions and how quickly things can get out of control  and it shows that in war  no one is right  demange s feature debut miraculously distills the often byzantine nature of the power politics behind the troubles in a deeply intimate chamber piece about a single day in the life of a british soldier  the movie excites  but intelligently  without stoking blood lust or old testament revenge impulses  if you are in the mood for a confusing and thoroughly depressing immersion into irish history  you can t do better  but that would be a very odd mood to be in  scenes take on a surreal nightmare quality  sometimes with no accompanying sound  as even the camera seems dazed by what it is witnessing  a perfectly paranoiac score by david holmes and downright stunning camerawork  courtesy of cinematographer tat radcliffe  enhance and embody hook s manic flight  
1535,hitchcocktruffaut,jones has laid enough of a foundation on hitchcock s style that viewers can watch one of cinema s most famous moments with fresh eyes  pretension is always with us  but the documentary s main effect will surely be to make you want to see hitchcock s films  including the marvel that is marnie  all over again  if nothing else  it works as an essential complement to the book the only drawbacks to an excellent documentary are the skimpy treatment of hitchcock s 1930s british work and the lack of diversity among the interviewees  jones could have included at least one or two female film makers  it s hard not to be infectiously drawn in by the passion on display here  the material begs for a much longer consideration than the film s trim 79 minutes  but it s still a must watch for serious film fans  a landmark film book gets its just deserts  the cleverly curated clips are stunning and the analysis thought provoking in this richly rewarding piece  anytime you get smart and accomplished filmmakers talking about film  theory and their respective styles  the results are rewarding  you won t have a merrier time at the movies this holiday season  the meeting of the two men becomes increasingly fruitful  and there s the sense of a private genius finally allowing himself to tip his hand  in an age in which celebrity gossip and page views trump all  hearing two masters talk intelligently about movies and how they re made is  if nothing else  a welcome treat

1537,the_second_mother,all the elements of the story fit impeccably together for a humorous and occasionally wrenching examination of relationships  the characters are so accustomed to keeping up appearances that they can t bring themselves to say what s bugging them  their interactions may be mild  but the claustrophobic imagery creates the sense of being trapped in a powder keg  the second mother strikes a passionate moral chord that also connects with conversations about the importance of achieving social change through cross generational education  anna muylaert s close setting cleverly lends itself to broader reflections on tradition  but cas makes the story sing  utterly convincing  it is socio economic warfare beautifully written and it is socioeconomic warfare exquisitely performed and it is socioeconomic warfare undertaken with humour and heart  and if you re still not sold  more fool you  it s the funny  edgy  engaging tale of a fingers to the bone maid who must cope with a small minded employer  a headstrong daughter and a changing social fabric harder to handle than the endless laundry she hangs on the clothesline  anna muylaert s observations on family relations and invisible but firm class barriers are always acute  even if she ultimately mines them for hope rather than horror  it smartly uses its little moments of humiliation to open our eyes to a world of delicate  but deep  injustice

1539,court,just when you imagined that the courtroom drama had no particular place left to go  along comes chaitanya tamhane s fiendishly clever debut feature  here s a film maker training a sharp  prosecutorial eye on those harsh homefront realities bollywood has traditionally permitted audiences to escape  court is fascinating  affecting and completely engrossing while delivering a devastating critique of a system so antiquated and absurd that a woman is told her case won t be heard today because she is wearing a sleeveless top  although the film is an unruffled work of fiction  the absurdity of the legal and political state of affairs it quietly but powerfully comments upon may be all too real  untrained actor vira sathidar is wonderful as kamble  a proud man who remains stoic even as an antiquated and often absurd legal system chips away at his freedom  this isn t your typical courtroom drama about an idealistic attorney with a savior complex per se  the film dramatizes how authorities can systematically police thought and harass radicals with bogus charges  suffused with a pointed  cool  never didactic despair  tamhane s narrative feature debut exposes india s highly dysfunctional judicial system  one still upholding scores of laws dating back to british rule almost seventy years after independence  for the most part  tamhane improbably succeeds in creating a damning courtroom drama that derives much of its power from observing the cogs in the machinery when the machine is switched off  it treats the audience as both witness and jury and lays out a sprawling argument for them to ponder over  it s hard to shake this one off long after the credits have rolled

1541,ingrid_bergman_in_her_own_words,anyone who watches this lively documentary will fall a little bit in love with one of cinema s romantic rebels  it would have been nice to have examined more of bergman s odd transatlantic career    glimpses of an early screen test can only be described as ravishing    but classic hollywood buffs will be well served  nonetheless  the film is never less than engaging and it is a treasure trove of wonderful images  the film is riveting when it delves into the complex family dynamics  but it could have used some tightening  using a variety of sources  swedish film critic stig bjorkman created this revealing documentary about the resilient movie star who won three academy awards and worked with bogart  hitchcock  ingmar bergman and roberto rossellini  in its occasionally over gentle way  the documentary testifies to the ego necessary to be a great star and to live a great life  devotees of classic hollywood will miss this movie at their peril  documentarian stig bjrkman has sifted through a hefty amount of material to construct a telling portrait of an intriguing star   she went where the wind took her   pia lindstrm says  and this revealing film shows where those destinations were  there isn t a lot here about her films  or great performances  but this is two hours of ingrid bergman  much of it rarely seen before  i m not about to complain  cinephile catnip

1548,straight_outta_compton,the movie has inescapable verve  capturing why its subjects mean every bit as much as the sex pistols or rolling stones  
1549,girlhood_2015,the movie captures that heady adolescent sense of time stopping and the moment mattering while standing far enough back to let us acknowledge all the pitfalls marieme is moving too fast to see  director sciamma uses an uncommonly light touch in depicting marieme s gradual transformation from an unformed blank slate into a self assured girl who doesn t always make the right decisions in the process of figuring herself out  
1550,the_gift_2015,it s a concept that s more often the basis of arrested development comedies about late bloomers who finally come into their own  but there s nothing funny about how the past looms over the adults that gordo and simon have become  edgerton s talent as an actor has been evident for a while  but the gift announces him as a genuine triple threat  clever and atmospheric  the film has enough twists to keep the average viewer guessing  of all blumhouse s productions  this is the one that really deserved to be called insidious  the gift starts out like so many other thrillers before it   with an attractive  well to do couple purchasing a big new house   and then beats its own  uniquely tense and twisted path from there  just when we think we know where the gift is going  we re surprised  and then surprised again  edgerton not only wrote the movie but makes an impressive directorial debut with the ripe for discussion subject matter of bullying and its after effects  quibbles about the ending aside  the gift deserves to be ranked among such films as bill paxton s underrated southern gothic thriller frailty  edgerton s touch as a director and writer is fluid   he eerily holds our attention  like hitchcock holds a door for tippi hedren  it touches on notions of trust  the male ego and forgiveness  but edgerton doesn t overturn any new stones  
1551,the_wonders_2015,rohrwacher s recreation of the monotonous rhythms of low tech farm life is every bit as attentive and diligent as the film s heroine  but the director s impressionistic approach to narrative does get a little frustrating  what s worth wondering at is the way writer director alice rohrwacher illustrates the private world of an authentic and genuinely loving family  a prize winner at the cannes film festival  this naturalistic italian drama presents a warm and credible portrait of a modern beekeeping family in the tuscan countryside  structurally   the wonders  suffers from awkward bulges and sags  especially toward the end  still  it s a beautiful  richly imagined ride that doesn t end as much as evaporate into a dreamlike puff of smoke  it provides an incomplete portrait of lives strained by the urgency of keeping up with a honey maker s schedule  a throwback to different kind of filmmaking  smaller  more emotionally intense  more tactile  rohrwacher handles her material with a richly detailed naturalism and a keen eye for the risks posed by wolfgang s promethean grandstanding to his children  the wonders has an intimate  subtly buzzing power  like a rural fellini  rohrwacher mixes the mundane with the absurd to create a sometimes fabulous tale that always feels palpably real  without any of the self importance  maudlin sentimentality or winking reflexivity that characterises most coming of age tales  alice rohrwacher s second feature is a patient argument for  and quiet toast to  a rapidly disappearing way of life  the episodic storytelling style can seem haphazard but the writer director alice rohrwacher succeeds wonderfully well in capturing the richness of the kids  lives in their own remote and often brutal world

1555,the_end_of_the_tour_2015,i can t speak to its veracity  but i loved segel s work here  playing wallace as someone who over analyzed everything  to a compulsive  near paralyzing degree  while still managing to be the most interesting  literary guy in the room  strong performances from the lead actors anchor the film  but the world depicted is rather too hermetic for anyone not immediately interested in the subject matter  despite the depiction of rivalry and discomfort  its tone is not harsh  there s something restrained and carefully poignant about the film and the rueful reverence it displays for its central figure  it s a movie that makes thoughtful drama out of the essential insanity of celebrity journalism  wherein a star proclaims humility while a scribbler promises idolatry  ponsoldt s done it again in this insightful two character piece with piercing performances by segel and eisenberg  more intellectually than emotionally compelling  but segel s sincere performance as wallace gives the movie a beating heart  in segel s performance   the film  captures the quandary of an immensely gifted and immensely troubled writer who disdained the celebrity he also  without fully fessing up to it  sought  moving  morally engaged drama  what segel does  from his opening minutes on screen to the movie s end  is craft a portrait of what feels like an utterly real person  not an actor s portrayal of one  
1556,99_homes,99 homes is very good at showing that the housing crisis is not a problem that belongs to one person  a simplistic but stirring morality play centered on the pressure point of the savings and loan crisis   inside job  could almost be an alternative title for this gripping and timely drama  which makes none of the family s choices look easy  bahrani s film asks a timely  yet timeless  question  how far would you go to save your home  would you be wiling to lose yourself in the bargain  i wish i could say 99 homes delivers a shockingly good sucker punch to the american electorate and a stand up and cheer piece of socially conscious filmmaking  but it s not  michael shannon and andrew garfield make for an incendiary combo  as a predatory realtor and his desperate protg  while bahrani and his co writers approach the subject matter with all the noisy subtlety of a bar brawl  the film rises above mere polemics thanks to charged performances from andrew garfield and especially michael shannon  bahrani nails the predicament in which so many working class folks now find themselves  although they cling to the american dream  for many of them it has become a nightmare  ramin bahrani   goodbye solo   has an extraordinary gift for making intimate dramas that do more than exemplify complex and murky issues  they illuminate them  99 homes is both a peerless entertainment and a cri di coeur against a financial system that preyed on the weakest americans  
1557,a_most_violent_year,a most violent year s final scenes are its worst  they reveal that the plot s sure footed plodding hasn t led anywhere unexpected  narratively or thematically  a most violent year resonates as the rare film to not simply take its superficial cues from the godfather  but to truly understand its underlying ideas    and  more impressive still  to re work them into something thrillingly unique  like that camel hair coat abel wears  a most violent year is classy and commands respect  but a stronger pulse under the lapels would make us care much more  abel is a man with ideals in a world that has no use for them  if he s going to succeed  he s going to have to use his wits instead of bullets  this isn t a revolutionary or thematically rich motion picture  but it s a well told story featuring solid performances and a nice sense of atmosphere  a most violent year keeps its action tinder largely dry  the fireworks generated instead by tense conversations between husbands and wives  lawyers and district attorneys  police and putative thieves  these characters coolly roam through every precise  purposeful scene like the metaphors they are  seemingly motivated by artistic intent as opposed to baser human desires  even michael corleone had a temper  a libido  a pulse  bradford young s cinematography is awesome  transforming bleak wastelands and mansions into visions of light  it s as if we re seeing everything through the eyes of morales  to whom america is beauty incarnate  a 1980s new york organised crime thriller that confounds the mobster mould  this tale of crime  corruption and soft furnishings resembles a sunday supplement scorsese  it s kind of a thriller  but any genre expectations will be thwarted by writer director j c  chandor s almost perverse pleasure in stopping shy of the boiling point  a most violent year is all about the simmer  
1558,the_duke_of_burgundy, peter strickland s  new movie has more going on than cinematic mind games  the duke of burgundy is no mere style exercise or slavish homage  strickland finds both humour and pathos in the situation of cynthia and evelyn  who are every bit as trapped as the insects they collect and catalogue  the duke of burgundy  as well as being a loving homage to an antique genre of soft core porn  shows how difficult it can be  not just making fantasy work but simply being with another person     peter strickland s wryly subversive s m fantasy is everything that fifty shades of grey isn t  a meticulously choreographed erotic theatre  d anna and knudsen maintain a fantastic hauteur  both lingerie and perfume are mentioned in the credits  some may find all this a little arousing  such reactions are allowed  the movie inhales the lost aroma of ingmar bergman s persona and joseph losey movies such as the servant and accident  and also looks like an agile homage to the arthouse eroticism of walerian borowczyk at his most preposterous  a tiny  tasteful throwback to more innocent times  when actresses with exotic names would strip off their costumes while embracing far fetched scenarios   and one another  it s an impressive achievement  the rendering of a private and extremely particular world in terms that any lover will understand  while strickland s films already aren t like anyone else s  his real secret is that even in this strange constructed world  his characters feel like real people struggling with issues that aren t exotic at all

1569,clouds_of_sils_maria,as valentine and marie argue over their interpretations of the play  it sparks an ongoing discussion about youth  aging  memory  superstition and fame  assayas establishes a complex emotional weather system in which age and identity ebb and flow as mysteriously as the titular clouds that snake through the engadin valley  kristen stewart achieves the impressive feat of outshining juliette binoche in this rich drama from olivier assayas  it gives artistic types an easy ride but it s a feast of rich writing and great acting  and if you ve only ever seen kristen stewart in twilight movies  she is in a different class here  an enigmatic chamber drama in the tradition of ingmar bergman  centred on two women who could be mirror images or aspects of a single self  the nuances of the women s interactions are a splendid thing to observe  and the beauty of these layered conversations makes the general absence of women s unmitigated voices in film more keenly felt than ever  binoche  on whom the camera affectionately lingers  makes herself achingly vulnerable  though the film feels at times a bit cloudy and enigmatic  it s often fascinating in its juxtapositions  brilliant performances aside   clouds of sils maria  is overlong and much too self indulgently an  art film   it might have benefited from being just a bit more grounded  the big surprise is stewart  who gives her most grounded performance to date  with her role in this film  she became the first american actress to win a csar award  the real star turns out to be the play itself  the early masterpiece of a now deceased writer  a work of such mirrorlike perfection that it reveals entirely different things to different people  
1570,janis_little_girl_blue,a feast of archive footage and audio recordings takes us on an engrossing journey from folk clubs to rock festival stages  while friends and relatives remember the force of nature that was joplin with a song between her teeth   baby i know just how you feel   she sang  and no one doubted that at all  a soft woman emerges  her singing voice may have sounded like a soul cut by sandpaper  but her speaking voice was polite and gentle  it traces the arc of joplin s growth as an artist and gives a hint of the performer she could have become  as she learns to harness the innately feral talent that made her name  despite the gloomy title and the subject s tragic demise  this valuable documentary of incendiary 1960s blues rocker janis joplin is actually more celebration than eulogy  although packed with compelling archive footage  this never quite gets into joplin s head  heart or soul  from this pastiche joplin emerges as we ve never seen her before  articulate  ambitious  torn between her wild self and her desperate need for stability  smoothly told  with the sweetly vulnerable joplin letters adding an additional layer of pathos  it s a sad story that leaves us wondering what might have been  though sluggish in the middle section  the film is nonetheless effective in illustrating how a star as incendiary as joplin could dim and ultimately die in the spotlight  the director interviewed just about everyone relevant to joplin s life story who is still alive  she uses archival footage and joplin s letters   read by singer songwriter chan marshall  a k a  cat power   to add voices from beyond the grave  this is a meticulously researched film that makes good use of its incredible access  
1571,antman,at long last marvel studios offers up a superhero smaller than its artistic ambitions  
1572,ill_see_you_in_my_dreams,a nuanced lead performance by blythe danner anchors this better than average entry in the growing subgenre of light dramas about baby boomers learning to enjoy retirement  
1573,we_are_still_here,showcasing juicy performances by its actors who tear into their stock roles with admirable conviction  the film looks terrific  
1574,hard_to_be_a_god_2015,the result may be an awe inspiring folly rather than a fully realised masterpiece  but it s radically out of the ordinary  oblique and dense in a manner that makes those other great strugatsky inspired films look like star wars episodes  the film relentlessly hammers out humanity s propensity for barbarism  a slo mo kaleidoscope of chaos and also a relentless prose poem of fear  featuring three hours  worth of non sequitur dialogue  where each line is an imagist stab with nothing to do what has just been said  one of the greatest movies to be released this year and perhaps any other  though it s hard to feel entirely at peace with the fact that it exists  not only an unforgettable individual masterpiece but probably one of the capital g great films  the roiling setting alone enforces a medieval mind set that feels genuine  brutal yet often jovially rambunctious and crude  pre psychological in its sense of the cheapness of life and yet rich with local custom and detail  hard to be a god is such a singular anomaly that it s tempting to suspend any value judgment  i felt as much overwhelmed  oppressed  exhausted by it as bewitched  and i wonder how many viewers its genuinely hermetic brilliance will connect with  an epic lurch through the circle of the inferno dante left out  where we are buried chin deep in wet manure  
1575,man_from_reno,i m always happy to see actors of color in film  but even more so i am happy to see them in good films  if you can hang on for close to two hours with almost no resolution  it s worth the ride  writer director dave boyle is best known for his offbeat rom coms with san francisco musician goh nakamura  surrogate valentine  daylight savings   and his gift for eccentric characters redeems this standard whodunit  the droll joke is that asian double crossers have it even easier than vertigo s kim novak    westerners don t even try to tell them apart  boyle s mystery is both maddening in how much it withholds from the viewer trying to play along  and impressive for how little you end up caring about being kept in the dark  polished and ambitious  this crime drama puts a fresh bicultural spin on a retro style mystery but doesn t quite sustain the suspense  like his two leads  boyle maintains a matter of factness that allows us to survey the evidence and reach our own conclusions  
1576,queen_of_earth,it displays some of the navel gazing impulses of the mumblecore movement  it s no surprise to see that mumble originator joe swanberg serves as a producer  at times  the style is very mannered but moss and waterston give rich and subtle performances as the two feuding friends who provide a twisted reflection of one another  moss is incandescently brilliant as a woman who smiles when she should be unnerved and boils with rage at the most inconsequential slights  if you re gonna go hard to the closeup  you re gonna want to work with a face like elisabeth moss s  the film would be nothing but a hollow exercise if its hollowness weren t so hauntingly precise  this is a lovingly rendered  feel bad chamber piece chock full of elliptical psychodrama  perry may never make a movie for the masses  whoever they are  but his truest work burrows into weird  blackly comic places few other filmmakers would dare explore  for some viewers  the acidity level of perry s movie will be too high to stomach  for others anyone who thinks that there are too many warm hugs in strindberg  for example  queen of earth  awaits  an open wound  moss is terrific  yet queen of earth feels a touch brittle and precious  like the swirly pink hued script perry employs for his end credits  it s rare when a psychological drama gets us into a character s head without tricks or a voiceover  this drama from alex ross perry burrows so deep that it s scary  
1577,red_army_2015,there s a lesson here for fans of any contemporary sport and an absolutely thrilling tale  impeccably assembled besides  sporting glory awaits  even for those viewers who couldn t tell a jockstrap from a jellybean  it s a mark of polsky s ambition and canniness that he braids hockey not just with geopolitics but also with personal history and human drama  polsky keeps things lively  both visually and with his editing  but the sometimes lighthearted approach never undermines the serious business at hand  wittily edited and beautifully scored   red army  is not just a terrific film but an important one   even if you don t give two hoots about ice hockey  sports  and hockey in particular  were a propaganda tool for the communist system  which is richly illustrated here in archival footage and poster art  this engaging documentary provocatively suggests that the team succeeded in large part because of communist indoctrination  an easy to digest history lesson that still reverberates on today s geopolitical landscape  as they say in hockey  polsky pulls off a hat trick  polsky winds up being as canny a storyteller as his subject   whom he gratifyingly and hilariously prevents from having the last word  audiences knowing nothing about hockey will still be able to appreciate this movie as a somewhat jaunty take on the cold war and its aftermath   and resurgence  red army is gabe polsky s compelling but skewed documentary on the soviets  less than sporting mentality when it came to the international skating and puck shooting game  no need to be a sports fan to become enthralled with  red army   the documentary held me in its grip from start to finish  
1578,trainwreck,schumer s performance is a tour de force of razor sharp comedic timing  at times it feels as if five different films are going on at once  but schumer s whip smart delivery and no holds perkiness keeps it all in place  at best  it s a two hour assemblage of hit n miss sketches revolving around the vicissitudes of the manhattan dating scene  where trainwreck comes unstuck is in its struggle to raise laughs from tactless material  the title of the movie suggests its heroine is in need of repair  but the early sequences of her tottering home in high heels and sneaking outside during a date to get high defy condemnation  you forget how limited so many movies  ideas of women are until schumer launches into an extended tampon joke  it s a film about everyday sexism and double standards  it s got no rhythm or reliable comfort zone  the jokes and ensemble scenes are all rushed  so you can t savor them or what anyone in them is doing  
1579,the_hunting_ground_2015,the hunting ground succeeds as a damning portrait of how colleges have allowed sexual assault to go unchecked  valuing their own reputations over the lives of vulnerable students  an important film to see for parents  students and anyone involved with academia  important but devastating viewing  when and where your frustration and anger boil over while watching  the hunting ground  is an individual experience  one that will be different for everyone who sees it  the hunting ground qualifies as activist filmmaking  more power to it  you can read all the statistics you want  but there s no substitute for bearing witness   especially in such overwhelming numbers  the hunting ground finds a narrative spine in the story of two rape victims  andrea pino and annie e  clark  students at the university of north carolina at chapel hill who wound up launching their own grassroots investigation into the epidemic  the documentary makes a persuasive case that certain colleges and universities    which are called out onscreen    foster a culture that punishes victims and protects serial predators  though far from a perfect film  the hunting ground is a significant piece of advocacy journalism that shows young women refusing to be mute about crimes that have been commited against them  the hunting ground s most unsettling finding is widespread institutional tolerance of campus rapists  because school administrators fear bad publicity and the loss of alumni cash endowments  it s uncomfortable viewing  but scrupulously researched and movingly told  there s a dicey feeling of familiarity to dick s new film  a sense of footage fitting into pre existing slots     instead of putting a human face on appalling statistics  the faces are starting to look like just more quantifiable evidence 
1580,mississippi_grind,it s a terrific film  but it came and went in cinemas before many people could discover it  a loose  funky character study of two guys who can only frame their station as  can t win  and  can t lose   and can t really imagine a life that s anywhere in between  mendelsohn seems at ease on the razor s edge that divides the radiant from the wretched  eschewing familiar vistas  fleck and boden take us on a tour of boarded facades and crumbling casinos light years away from the glamour of vegas or atlantic city  mississippi grind is a rarity  an american movie about gambling that actually acknowledges that when you stay up all night in a badly lit room  your skin is likely to become very clammy and blotchy  the film earns major points for giving ben mendelsohn a proper  meaty character to tussle with  no longer psychotic second banana or madballs deus ex machina  it is a watchable if faintly baffling movie  never anything other than well acted  conspicuously without allegiance to any conventional three act screenplay structure  it s as if the scarecrow and the tin man got lost and wandered down the mississippi river  drinking and gambling and stumbling into and out of various troubles  not worrying about their brains or their hearts  just wishing for a little bit of luck  mendelsohn manages to make us simultaneously feel sorry for him and hope  against what seem like steep odds  that he somehow succeeds  for the most part  their odd coupling works  each character propping up the other until their paths must inevitably diverge  
1581,the_pearl_button_2015,as always  guzm n unearths details that establish resonant connections between diverse worlds  the  pearl button  of the title proves typically allusive  but at a brief 82 minutes this feels like too many streams gathering in one overcrowded pool  a sobering  lyrical essay film on chile s various physical and emotional surface areas  despite the striking photography  this fascinating denunciation of 150 years of persecution and oppression lacks guzm n s customary trenchancy and restraint  we get a hint that guzm n is trying to find resonances where none naturally exist  another philosophical and cosmic historical documentary  ultimately  the material starts to feel thin  with guzm n attempting to cover everything in less than 90 minutes  patricio guzman  who chronicled the military coup against salvador allende in his documentary trilogy the battle of chile  has begun  in old age  to process his political experiences through stunning personal essay films  dealing with horrors of this intensity and scale  guzm n can be forgiven a slight penchant for the galactically vaporous  
1582,mr_holmes,as someone who neither hungers for yet another incarnation of this character nor understands why anyone would  i watched in subdued bafflement  
1583,boy_and_the_world,one wonders how receptive young audiences should be to a film that puts its storytelling secondary to its message making  
1584,disneynature_monkey_kingdom,adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing  with marvelous narration from tina fey  stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to disney s long tradition of nature family films  
1585,the_lady_in_the_van,she s not easy to love and the film is slow going and a little laboured in its attempts to shape her idiosyncrasies into a plot  but the gradual revelation of the reasons for her decline give smith plenty of opportunities to soften her grouchiness  bennett offers maggie smith a chance to renovate her own recent persona with a woman who s heroically alive  smith takes it with both hands  giving us more of the loneliness and despair of old age than the glib comedy  there s an elegiac  sentimental quality to this film adaptation  from the manipulative meet cute of alan and miss shepherd through their disputations  you leave  lady in the van  entertained but troubled  it s an agreeably but oddly off balance film  juggling and nearly dropping the star turn at its center  it s exhausting just to list the accolades that dame maggie smith has accumulated over her decades on screen and stage  imagine how tiring it must have been to earn them all  the film is based on actual events in the life of british writer personality alan bennett that he turned into a book in 1989  a play in 1999  and now a film directed by nicholas hytner  you might call this beating a dead horse  the english call it thrift  in the end  the mystery doesn t matter except insofar as it reveals the person at its heart  and it is alan s experience of that person that makes his account significant  if  as arthur miller wrote  attention must be paid to people we would prefer to overlook  bennett has done that for miss shepherd  with grace and humanity  it s about the boundless talents of maggie smith  sometimes chewing up the screen  sometimes saying volumes simply by sitting very  very still  with a perfectly perfect expression on her face  bennett livens up a narrative that trades heavily in reminiscence by splitting the character based on himself into two people and this proves to be a rich vein for bennett s comic musing  smith s performance is not only virtuosic but indispensable in grounding the various loose threads of the story  
1586,the_peanuts_movie,overall  wry observation and pathos take precedence over crowd pleasing slapstick  although some dreary pop songs prove a drag  without suffering  peanuts becomes little more than wholesome distraction for kiddies  
1587,when_marnie_was_there,while marnie lacks the densely mystical  immersive quality of ghibli at its best  the film features characteristically exquisite hand drawn animation and a sensitivity to the precarious  friable quality in an adolescent girl s self worth  the painterly  old school aesthetic brings an aptly nostalgic feel to this examination of how the past can haunt the present and the rapturous intensity of young friendship  at times as awkward as its young protagonist  yet brimming with the familiar ghibli magic  that s what ghibli s films have always done   they sweep over you like summer showers  and leave the world seeming brighter and refreshed  studio ghibli has created a gorgeous animation that digs deep within the darkest fears of childhood  while also weaving a beautiful tale of friendship that knocked me flat  dramatically unworthy of its gorgeous coastal landscapes and ever shifting light  to those film lovers attuned to quiet moments and emotional nuance  this film has a shine all its own  the old school hand drawn animation celebrates sweeping landscapes and but also the telling detail  revealing character through spare gestures  yonebayashi made his feature directing debut with the secret world of arrietty  adapted from the british children s book the borrowers  and this emotionally resonant second feature takes its story from another such title  as a children s movie  it s uncommonly sensitive and complicated  rooted in relationships rather than dazzling action  but adults may notice its simple poetry turning  after a while  to suds  
1588,james_white,it s not easy viewing by any means  but it is strangely refreshing for a movie to show us that terminal illness involves agony and vomit and terror  despite what beaches might have told us  whether you want to spend time with  james white  depends on your tolerance for yet another film about how hard it is for guys who just feel too much  it s abbott who s the revelation  showing off all sorts of previously unseen leading man potential  with an intimacy caught in tight close ups  abbott and nixon hold the pared down script and each other gently  like grief itself  this film might knock the wind right out of you  abbott s feral depiction of such fierce loyalty is something close to brilliant  a knockout lead performance by christopher abbott and a superb supporting turn by cynthia nixon make the propulsive and deeply felt  james white  worth experiencing despite a difficult  at times elliptical story  mond  making his feature directing debut after producing a slew of intriguing indies  brings intensity to an intimate domestic drama about a feckless new york city slacker who appears to have a fight or flight approach to a familial crisis  josh mond s debut film is the indie find of the year  filled with scenes that hit like a shot in the heart  cynthia nixon digs so deep into her character that you can feel her nerve endings  alas for james  sadness is not a jerk license and his bid to seem dark and complicated merely comes across as tiresome self pity  with the camera close on his expressive face  abbott finds power in explosions of self destruction and glimpses of vulnerable soul within the character  an honest  moving  and occasionally even funny portrait of what happens when a cripplingly immature young man gets hit with one reality check after another  
1589,bone_tomahawk,ultraviolence aside  there s plenty to admire about this innovative genre bender  cult status could beckon for this well made  macabre and violent western horror from cinematographer turned director s craig zahler  it has a nice line in wry chatter and a pleasantly old fashioned  lost posse  plot with engaging  odd characters striving against the wilderness while swapping cynical frontier wisdom  you ll be watching   at least  i was   with your hand clamped over a mouth in various states of aghast ness  but the film s bloodiest moments  in a real turn up for the books  are also its saddest  with this film the cowboy genre moves beyond modern and postmodern  you could call it postmillennial  post apocalyptic  post ironic  a precariously balanced  genre literate oddity with something to say  while the genre jump from john ford to eli roth may be off putting to some  it raises the stakes on a climax in a way that most westerns fail to do  viewed through the lens of italian exploitation films  bone tomahawk starts to make sense  it s an uneasy mixture of bizarre character development  arty dialogue laced with black humor and gruesome horror flick  the characters are thoughtfully embellished  and zahler s script finds occasional traction with engaging dialogue that includes exploration of the men s contrasting attitudes about marriage  
1590,the_revenant_2015,ultimately  the revenant suggests no deeper or more nuanced truths than a medieval morality play  i  rritu continues move away from his earlier work  which i still prefer  to bring a more hollywood digestible tale like this one that blends themes of spirituality  primal instinct and humanity  as it is  you re bound to be impressed by what the actors went through  but you won t be so bothered about the characters they play  this is a frontier story made as no other has been before  it s immense  leonardo dicaprio delivers a barnstorming performance as the embattled glass  whose quest for survival takes him on a herzogian odyssey to the very borders of life and death  i admired its ambition  but also found it an endurance test  i was longing for it to be over  and so relieved when it was  the locations and cinematography are wow inducing  as an action movie with a grisly exploitation edge  the revenant could have been a triumph  but inarritu can t seem to stop lunging after greatness  some of his symbolic touches reach new heights of kitsch  the film  never less than visually magnificent  is almost entirely pointless  a shaggy bear story at best  dicaprio is called on to depict the man s desperation  grief and searing anger almost entirely through his eyes and he does it with remarkable depth  turning glass s endurance into a steadfastness both physical and emotional  how do you decide who is in charge and what to do  the film s most fascinating moments are the ones where we see characters across the continuum on those questions  
1591,dope_2015,the film falls so hard off its course that i basically checked out after about 40 minutes  the film s primary colour palette provides a satirical antidote to cinema s more familiar gangsta hues  the setting and these traits   including diggy s slippery sexuality   ensure that dope never becomes just another laddish adventure pivoting around a bag of drugs  an authentic inner city parable that fails to live up to its initial promise  this coming of age story set in south central la may not know quite what it wants to say  but it sure has fun saying it  rather than judging his characters for turning to crime  famuyiwa makes society the target of his anger  implying that in an unequal world  even a kid as bright as malcolm has little chance of succeeding by honest methods alone  moore gives a performance layered with energy  and famuyiwa s direction is equally charismatic  the film s rascally kineticism very nearly compensates for its underdeveloped ideas  the film s ability to confound expectations while delivering some big laughs may be its most crowd pleasing characteristic but the anti stereotype message rings clear as a bell throughout  dope s biggest strength lies in its affectionate and honest portrait of a different kind of young urban blackness than we re used to seeing on movie screens  the film feels off kilter more often than not  though it isn t without its inspired  successful moments  even as famuyiwa acknowledges the preconceptions that malcolm s blackness engenders  he invites audiences to identify with the character on the basis of his relatable interests  aspirations and vulnerabilities  
1592,the_black_panthers_vanguard_of_the_revolution_2015,the film doesn t shake our suspicion that the stories being told have calcified into legend  
1593,the_walk_2015,you can t help comparing this film to the 2008 documentary man on wire featuring the man himself  i actually hid my eyes from the laser projected 3d imax image at one point  overwhelmed by the sheer visceral spectacle of it all  
1594,sunshine_superman,a generally splendid documentary by marah strauch about people throwing themselves off cliffs  literally  
1595,respire_2014,breathe is a deftly observed look at teen power games and how closeness can turn to animosity in one miserable night out  laurent has an excellent eye for shot composition  and cinematographer arnaud potier s crisp photography aids the director in creating an enviable set of gorgeous and memorable shots  and the film is consistently visually compelling  in some ways it plays like a horror movie  in other ways it s almost a documentary  these are extraordinary performances  and considering france s way of nurturing female talent  japy and de laage could be at the dawn of 40 year careers  they re that good  the entire piece is precisely woven together  from script to performance to execution  and the result is a chilling study of emotional annihilation and its aftermath  breathe is also about the great intimacy between girls that is an exclusively female domain  the closest boys can achieve is a bromance  but don t even think about cuddling and stuff  bro   an obsessive friendship between two teenage girls unfolds with equal amounts of tenderness and terror in breathe  a modest but acutely observed and affecting adolescent portrait  though the story has undergone quite a few changes  what s intact is the novel s grittiness and emotional honesty  which more than compensates for the occasional coming of age cliche  with her co screenwriter  julien lambroschini  laurent doesn t make the mistake of overhyping the mounting dread  the intensity is best served by their methodical  low key approach   breathe  conveys an uncanny insight into the psychology of late adolescence  when lingering childhood fantasies can combust with burgeoning adult sexuality in a swirl of uncontrollable feelings  it s perhaps no surprise that laurent  who could probably have played sarah herself a decade ago  gets superb performances from her two young leads  aside from the innate understanding of female friendship dynamics  it s hard to see exactly what else m lanie laurent brings to this overly familiar story  
1596,gueros,draining the color in service of the disillusioned youth may initially seem detrimental to the depiction of mexico  but the gorgeous and striking cinematography emits its own radiance  capturing every gradient of silver  it plays like a dreamy  structurally fractured richard linklater homage to the french new wave  seek this one out  then make a friend happy by forcing them to see it too  a very smart debut  handsomely shot by damian garcia in full frame black and white  g eros is at times both painfully arty and arbitrarily plotted  as a whole  gueros does not hang together at all  but its pieces are intriguing enough to warrant a look for fans of stylish visual filmmaking  every five minutes or so  ruizpalacios comes up with something strikingly expressionistic  even if g eros doesn t entirely work  it feels worthy  a film made independently and without interference whose reverence for the past thankfully doesn t result in too much solemnity or seriousness  more than perhaps any other country  mexico has lobbed some real cinematic intelligence onto the world stage in recent years   g eros  continues that salutary tradition  there s no reverie alonso ruizpalacios s g eros can t shatter  no presumed truth it can t complicate  no expectation of closure it won t dash  by all indications  ruizpalacios still seems to be finding his voice  and yet this modest little movie does seem to have its finger on the pulse  the film s droll humor and unexpected twists go a long way towards sustaining audience interest  even if the film goes from homage into self conscious parody territory several times  the film s social commentary unspools quietly in the background while the narrative focuses on the ennui  free floating anxiety  and inchoate longing for meaning experienced by two or three privileged young people from the middle  to upper middle classes  
1597,cartel_land,heineman goes through the gates of hell and comes back empty handed  horribly real  an urgent and alarming account of a crisis so hellishly labyrinthine it s hard to see how anyone can escape its widening web of violence  extortion and corruption  matthew heineman s documentary about the mexican drug wars plays like a real life version of some grim sam peckinpah western in which violence and corruption have become endemic  the road to hell  as paved with best intentions  has never looked better  thoroughly researched  occasionally engrossing  but ultimately frustrating  there s no doubting heineman and his crew s audacity as they venture close to the line of fire  but the commitment to observing dispassionately at all times starts to feel a bit like a cop out  there are scenes here unlike anything you ve seen  timely  thoughtful and supremely well constructed  we d be stunned if this isn t the doc to beat on oscar night  by the end of heineman s rattling 98 minutes  the war on drugs seems more than ever like a war destined to go on forever before being lost on every side  although the film has its shortcomings and simplifications  it s a bleakly persuasive view of a decades long combat that respects no boundaries  and seems to hold no prospect of surcease  a worthwhile report on a pressing humanitarian issue  it s one thing to invent a vigilante drama as darkly perfect as this  it s another to capture it as it actually unfolds  
1598,backcountry,macdonald does quite well in his dramatic feature debut with solid performances from the cast  backcountry is satisfyingly intense  although quite gory in patches  i already think twice about going in the ocean thanks to  open water  and now i ll have the same problem with camping courtesy of this disturbingly brilliant feature directorial debut  a couple of weekend backpackers face off against man and beast in director adam macdonald s accomplished  blunt force wilderness adventure  apparently inspired by a true story that the movie made me very much not want to look up  which i suppose may be taken by some to be a token of its effectiveness  just when you thought it was safe to stand up to a bear in the woods  this jarring indie horror drama will make you scurry back indoors  macdonald elevates backcountry by couching what turns out to be a keenly observed relationship drama inside a horror flick  backcountry is simply another paranoid cinematic reminder that exiting the beaten path is a course best avoided   or  at least  one that also requires taking some basic  common sense precautions beforehand  
1599,kumiko_the_treasure_hunter,a truly mystifying human puzzle  at her best  kikuchi evokes the little match girl  bathing her bleak existence with too brief warmth  
1600,moonlight_2016,moonlight displays the kind of empathy and humanity that we desperately need right now  jenkins boils a life down to its decisive moments  a life in three parts is an eloquent and acute summation with nicholas britell s heart rending music underlining  moonlight may be a quiet  understated gem  but you can expect the buzz surrounding it to become deafening  i doubt that i will see a better film than moonlight this year  cinema has been in and around this area time and time again  but moonlight still feels abundantly fresh and endlessly imaginative  from the start moonlight announces itself as something different entirely  this is a deeply compassionate film that not only does astounding work on the being black  being gay front  but is also about anybody who feels they exist outside the world they ve been born into  you won t find a more sensitively rendered  evocative  or surprising coming of age film than barry jenkins s moonlight  moonlight is at its most eloquent when its subtext is soft spoken  a genre defying film  its visual splendour belies its tough  surface level subject matter  while the performances pull us deep below that surface with their soulful naturalism  a personal political triptych which offers keen perspectives on masculinity  queer sexuality  racial identity  and the odd angles at which they intersect  
1601,arrival_2016,everything about arrival feels meticulously crafted  from the gorgeously composed shots to the j hann j hannsson score  a spielberg nolan lovechild of sorts  wondrous and mind bending in equal parts  denis villeneuve s latest is a quintessential science fiction blockbuster steeped in genre traditions and made singular by amy adams s transporting performance  it s a film you ll want to discuss and debate with your friends  the message may not be original but the methodology certainly is  a movie doesn t have to spell everything out for me if i get a sense that the filmmaker is offering me something to ponder the revelation here is villeneuve  who expands on the symphonic pacing showcased last year in the drug war drama sicario  even though the concept of arrival is far out fiction  villeneuve treats it with no less detail or urgency  arrival may be just the poem we need  a departure from the dystopian visions which now appear all too real  a memory of a future in which light still shines in the darkness  the chomsky esque notions that language shapes our thinking even more than our thinking shapes language is conveyed in the film s own structure as well as its dialog  learning heptapodese seems easy compared to the tough talks americans need to have with each other  those expecting a whiz bang film should be prepared for a more cerebral and emotional experience  admirable for its ambition and tone  if not wholly satisfying in its payoff  arrival plays with your head as gently as any sci fi thriller i can remember  arrival has the look and feel of a big ticket production  albeit torqued towards millennial melancholy  complete with a muted  blue grey colour palette by cinematographer bradford young  
1602,manchester_by_the_sea,writer director kenneth lonergan s manchester by the sea made me leave the theater feeling empty    it could easily be filed away as just another white male angst narrative  not a moment in the film is wasted  though on the long side  this is from start to finish a rewarding and strangely beautiful drama with a conclusion that is immensely satisfying in its touching understatement  with an outstandingly icy casey affleck as a mournful loner drawn back into his old fold  kenneth lonergan s new england community study is a masterful  darkly american account of a heart in the dead of january  this is about life as it is lived in the real world  with unassuageable pain  loose ends untied  life lessons unlearned  life with no narrative closure  each scene brims with self contained humour and drama  regardless of whether it moves the story along or simply fills in background colour  for all its moments of discord  manchester by the sea sings its lonely song with tremendous heart and soul  lonergan is so precise with his actors  the sense of place  and the level control of tone that you feel him methodically striving here to avoid false notes  this is without question my favorite film of the year unforced acting couples with a nuanced  insightful script to tell a story that  although seemingly simple  is achingly complex  affleck is magnificent  but the movie is something less than that  because it can t completely overcome some built in challenges  even so  manchester by the sea deserves honors for being so different  and for working on the mind in a particular way its initial enigma seems to need no explanation  yet  once deciphered  the film does not falter but moves only deeper into the emotional territory it charts  
1603,la_la_land,it makes it more difficult to just let something like la la land just passively wash over you when  however well intentioned  the film hearkens back to a time when black humanity onscreen was deliberately hamstrung  don t get me wrong  la la land is fun and cutesy  and made me leave the theater with a big  goofy smile on my face  but there s one distinct difference between good movie musicals and great movie musicals  it s just gorgeous  like a flipbook made of dreamy vintage postcards that are somehow about contemporary life in los angeles  it is simply a splendid continuation of cinema s ever evolving love affair with song and dance  la la land ravishes from densely populated beginning to eye moistening denouement  the film is at its most convincing in those intimate exchanges between gosling  with his melted eyes  and stone  with her anime face  la la land with caveats is still more wonderful than almost anything else  open hearted gushy romanticism in cinemascope  what s not to love  if you haven t already fallen for this gauzy romp through the city of angels at this point  you surely will during the last scene  with its bittersweet homage to the way times goes by   chazelle s  filmmaking exuberance and the energy and sweetness of his two stars give this thin soup considerable tang  
1604,zootopia,what saves this big budget cartoon behemoth is its modest  old fashioned storytelling  
1605,finding_dory,who would have thought one of the deepest films ever made about learning disabilities would star a talking blue fish  much like its titular character  it keeps swimming  and in doing so teaches all of us life lessons that we likely already knew yet still could use to revisit all the same  it is approached with such charm and warmth that it hardly matters that the two films share such similar arcs  there are commendable lessons here about being resilient and resourceful and kind  but you ll have fun learning them  there are large dollops of sentimentality and we all know just how the story is going to end  but there s an enjoyably anarchic undertow to proceedings  not least when the fish commandeer a lorry and race the wrong way up a freeway  when there are lulls in the action  these are filled too often by homilies and life lessons that demand no spelling out  there are few dud jokes  if any  in a script directed with vaudevillian verve by andrew stanton  the human pilot fish behind nemo and wall e who also wrote toy stories one to three and monsters  inc  finding dory succeeds in transporting us to a wonderful underwater world while enhancing the franchise s emotional core  finding dory is enjoyable in its own right  even if its powerful sense of d j  vu keeps it from approaching the pinnacle of the disney pixar collaborations  
1606,hell_or_high_water,we will never get another howard hawks or raoul walsh  but  every now and then  we see a film that pays homage to their spirit  this neo western works splendidly as a self contained tale of loyalty  loss and redemption  with polished turns from a smoldering chris pine and spunky ben foster  this classic  thoughtful  and evocative storytelling lets audiences have a guilty pleasure watching two wretches get payback on a banking system that s ripping off old ladies  the whole movie offers ample evidence that  mackenzie  has stealthily achieved an unassuming but utterly genuine mastery of his craft  art heist  part western for the occupy generation  this sharply plotted thriller is a triumph for both director david mackenzie and writer taylor sheridan  there s no bonnie and clyde style glamour but the film has an emotional depth that you don t often find in a heist thriller  a smartly crafted heist thriller that quietly peels back the layers from its macho male characters to reveal the pain and tenderness inside  for mackenzie  a british filmmaker whose career to date has been nomadic  the movie feels like finally finding the right key for a lock  unexpected directions  sharp humour and powerful performances  taut  tense and burnished by jeff bridges at his best  this is a deceptively simple tale of texan cops and robbers that drags the old west into the modern age  from a purely narrative perspective  there s nothing new here but like a new arrangement of a familiar tune  the slight changes make it fresh and enjoyable  
1607,captain_america_civil_war,it s this levity that makes the much touted battle royale between team cap and team iron man so much fun  
1608,the_jungle_book_2016,a visually stunning and highly dramatic movie that pays only brief homage to the music of its predecessor and whose threatening characters and scary moments would surely have given walt the heebie jeebies  
1609,paterson,it s 2016 and we re still supposed to be impressed with watching a white guy move through life with quiet  alarmingly minimal  disappointments  no  thank you  as paterson makes these rounds again and again  jarmusch unhurriedly crafts a cinematic ode to finding both art and delight in the quotidian  jarmusch  who made supernatural vampires seem human in only lovers left alive  now finds inspiration in the mundane  a filmmaker telling his story in pictures and the limitlessness of control he brings to his art  what more can one ask of cinema  jim jarmusch s latest has moments of beauty that help compensate for a slightly static narrative  for the second year in a row  my favorite film is a winning love story named for an urban area more or less in my backyard  jarmusch is a next level storyteller with an amazing ability to deliver a scene that works on face value and as a metaphor if it sounds like not much happens in this film  well  have you ever seen a jim jarmusch movie  i think jarmusch has actually remade  groundhog day  as a work of spiritual ecstasy  i also think paterson the man may be a zen ralph kramden  or would you rather be a fish  driver s performance as an uncertain man getting through the day to day prosaic  quietly buoyed by passion and artistic commitment  is exquisite  we come away from the film filled with the alertness and engagement paterson and laura bring to their days  viewers are treated to a portrait of romantic devotion  contentment and vocation all the more affecting for being so utterly  unapologetically heartfelt  
1610,moana_2016,one of the mouse house s most sumptuous looking films from an animation standpoint  i have a soft spot for the gigantic  arrogant  avaricious crab named tamatoa  who knew the rock could belt out giddy showstoppers like an old broadway ham  directors ron clements and john musker here segue seamlessly into their first cg feature  embracing the malleable magic of digital animation while retaining the clear lines that underpinned their previous work  an amiable new animated musical that speaks to the tween princess sleepover demographic while tapping into polynesian myths and making a modest  decently intentioned gesture at diversity  there could be umpteen charges of kitsch  political incorrectness and mongrelised cultural history  yet this south seas hurricane of a film blows us away  scattering our faculties and effects and substituting its own  even if it isn t exactly unique  that doesn t make the movie any less rapturously entertaining moana functions as well as it does because the story team ultimately focused on finding everything about disney stories that worked in 2016  and improving everything that didn t  brimming over with spectacle and visual inventiveness  
1611,kubo_and_the_two_strings_2016,it explores unexpectedly profound ideas of rebirth and destiny rewritten  like origami paper sheets refolded into another form  there are so many layers  knight finding a way to navigate through them with dexterous ease  doing so without ever losing focus  
1612,hunt_for_the_wilderpeople, its  sheer good naturedness pulls off a not particularly inspired crusty old coot thawed by young scamp concept  maintaining an agreeable tonal balance despite occasional wobbles between spoof  sentimentality and silliness  strictly for those who love pie eyed problem pics with scenic wanderlust  
1613,things_to_come_2016,as denis lenoir s camera recedes into a carefully bisected domestic composition  the boundaries between the past  the present  and the future shimmer and blur together in a way that suggests that nothing ever really slows down  visually arresting  but never precious  it s filled with ideas that have relevance to actual life  ideas that are based on a moral conviction that a question well posed is far more valuable than an easy answer  following her triumph in elle  french screen legend isabelle huppert scores another bullseye with this delicate tale of philosophy professor starting over this french drama gives huppert a brilliant  rousseau quoting character to play around with  and she saunters through the role  finding fresh moments in every scene  it has slow patches  but it has a cumulative effect  thanks equally to hansen love and huppert  we come away feeling enriched and expanded  without exactly knowing how or why  things to come is astonishing  bringing delicate truths into the glaring light of day that are as timeless as they are universal  a career best performance by the increasingly essential isabelle huppert perhaps the most fascinating thing about watching philosophy professor nathalie chazeaux s  isabelle huppert  life crumble is the utter lack of drama accorded to various disasters by both the film and its characters  complementing hansen love s deft writing and direction  huppert transforms what might have been an unsympathetic role into a character who embodies universal anxieties  desires  weaknesses  and virtues  suffused with wry humor  vulnerability and radiant warmth  huppert s performance captures that delicate period in life during which resignation morphs into graceful  even grateful  acceptance  huppert never loses sight of the fact that nathalie s wounded heart often overrules her steel trap mind  this is an intelligently made film about an intelligent woman  but it s also emotionally engaging  who among us wouldn t like to feel that we could persevere even if stripped of nearly everything that defines us  hansen l ve s gift is in presenting this vast internal journey with elegance and clarity  resisting the urge for scenery chewing catharsis  
1614,doctor_strange_2016,an extremely entertaining and sure footed adaptation that manages to conjure more than enough magic to easily pass its spell check  
1615,love_and_friendship,the real pleasure here is in the complicated portrayal of the women of this time period and the various ways they navigate and subvert the gendered expectations put upon them by society  though the corseted bodices and full skirts suggest an oscar bait y period drama  stillman quickly establishes love   friendship as an out and out comedy  love   friendship is magnificent  and anyone saying otherwise is in my eyes one gouty attack away from objectionable ignominy  kate beckinsale takes much of the credit for the film s success  austen did like to have fun with her characters to show the stranger sides we all have  watching this classy adaptation of one of her lesser known works will remind you of that  and make you laugh  i ve never been much of a jane ite  myself  converted now  though  this is the zingiest austen adaptation you ll ever see  with the usual pastel palette and slow decorum abandoned in favour of acid colours and acid remarks  which keep the audience in stitches  why  mr stillman  we are driven to conclude that  in your match with miss austen  you have engineered a union more perfect than any found in divine nature  stillman doesn t upend the austen formula  he burrows into it and embraces all its trappings  the snappy dialogue  meanwhile  rewards a finely tuned ear and will thrill all lovers of language  even though this is a walking and talking film  except in those instances when it s a sitting and talking film  stillman keeps everything moving fast  fast  fast while the script crackles and spits and bites  a delightful comic romp that fans of the classic english author will love  it s self consciously mannered and merrily playful  a mixture that austen herself might find just right  
1616,the_nice_guys,a defiantly old school action comedy that delivers big where it really counts  
1617,weiner,it s a fabulously entertaining view from inside a political campaign  giving us a firsthand experience of all the weird  good wife style maneuvering that takes place  weiner shows  without embellishment  without cinematic sleight of hand  that a person s worst enemy remains themselves  in the end  it s hard to tell if his downfall is due to blind egotism or suicidal optimism  edited to perfection  this is like watching the slow motion footage of a building collapsing  the facts of the case are outlandish enough  but what s even more eye opening is that so much of it has been documented in real time by directors josh kriegman and elyse steinberg  weiner doesn t try to push the filmmakers away once the scandal breaks  they respond by treating their subject in an even handed way  you will often have to watch through your fingers  so cringe inducing are some of the scenes  the sheer unlikeliness of a politician sharing a name with a slang term for the organ of his undoing reflects the sheer unlikeliness of almost every twist and turn in this fly on the wall thrill ride  a case study in blunt force media trauma  a can t look away documentary about the trainwreck 2013 mayoral run of her husband  anthony weiner  easily escapes the fading headlines about a botched campaign to become an enduring portrait of a political animal caught in a technological trap  it s a movie from which you can t look away  no matter how hard you may try  
1618,the_handmaiden,far too good to be watched in one sitting  
1619,the_witch_2016,the film starts with wordy wittering and ends by trying to woo our shrieks    from arthur miller to dennis wheatley in the shortest time possible between two blunt points  i m fairly positive scares are not the point  eggers takes things to a place that s far more disconcerting  showing how human nature can be the most destructive of all forces  as a curio  the witch has its own fascination  at least until the over explicit finale shatters much of the mood that has been so carefully built up  aware that gender  as much as faith  remains a burning issue  eggers makes our hearts swell and our brains sweat  an atmospheric chiller rooted in the fertile soil of religious zealotry  social isolation and original sin  the little known cast of british actors succeeds in convincingly portraying these threatened pilgrims who  while seeking out a new and better life  find themselves in the middle of an inexplicable nightmare  anybody seeking torture porn or mindless jump shocks will be in for a disappointment  but eggers s slippery  intelligent film is not short of accumulating unease  like any outstanding horror film  its true impact only reveals itself once the credits have rolled and it stays buried under your skin  breaking through every now and then to remind you of its insidious power  the best moments are early on  its hypnotic spell lingers  in the tradition of william friedkin s the exorcist  this chilling low budget horror movie taps into the same temporal fear that sparks religious feeling  
1620,sing_street,carney nails every quirky detail  
1621,dont_think_twice,a deeply sincere and literate coming of age tale  it has more laughs than any big studio comedy i ve seen this year  but it s dead serious about the difficulty of creating something collectively in a world where everyone s chasing the spotlight  the most biting comedy of the summer has nothing to do with talking pets  don t think twice is about the creeping realization that you might not live up to that dreaded thing called potential or that the mythical big break might never come your way  it s also about learning to be okay with that  each actor  is  given multiple moments to shine  all of these recognizable faces bringing each of their respective characters to life with winsomely authentic determination and grace  clear eyed but generous   don t think twice  manages the neat trick of remaining sweet natured while letting absolutely no one off the hook  birbiglia s penetrating observational skills make don t think twice an exceptional film about both the comedy world and the plight of young professionals who wonder if they ve stalled out before even getting into gear  a smart  wistful and very funny movie in which six friends weather difficult times but ultimately realize that they do  indeed  have each other s back  for always  this sketch of a group of co workers coming together and potentially falling apart is at once a knowing glimpse into dashed dreams and a skillful portrait of fraying adult friendships  it s a movie that fleshes out the people who entertain us  not with bemusement like a christopher guest mockumentary  but with compassion  
1622,cameraperson,an autobiography of sorts  cameraperson demands we think beyond johnson s own extraordinary career and reflect upon our own status as observers  and the ethical and emotional responsibilities that come with it  cameraperson is at its best when it captures instances of unexpected life  watching cameraperson  we take johnson s rich images into ourselves  having watched them  experienced them  they become entangled with us  too  although we only see johnson s face once  briefly  it s a detailed self portrait of an extraordinary woman  kirsten johnson has created a resonant and revealing kaleidoscope of her life behind the camera on films from bosnian war documentaries to the edward snowden film citizenfour and even a portrait of the philosopher jacques derrida  cameraperson draws our attention not just to what we re seeing  but to how we re seeing it  it encourages us to wonder how a camera operator negotiates personal space in tense  intimate  emotionally fraught situations  cameraperson is not merely a grab bag of images  it pulls double duty as a theoretical essay on the cinematic apparatus itself  cameraperson summons us to really think about a world that is more connected than we may realize   cameraperson  testifies to a world in which it would be clear to see that we re all connected  if only we took the time to look at one another with reverence and simply listen  
1623,fences_2016,denzel swells with dangerous charisma  viola works high emotion from every one of her many lines  they are so good they almost convince us we re watching a movie  the stunning acting and august wilson s timeless words will captivate you again and again  
1624,10_cloverfield_lane,it works best whenever goodman swaggers into frame  a slack jawed psycho with a cuddly side  10 cloverfield lane might not be a true sequel to cloverfield  but that doesn t make it any less magnificent  watching it a spellbinding treat i simply did not want to see come to an end  john goodman brings his a game to the part of the tightrope walking howard who is at times kind and gentle and at others unhinged and cuckoo  mary elizabeth winstead matches him note for note  until its final ten minutes  this is a dazzling  absorbing  sometimes unbearably tense thriller  an efficient and precise three hander that rarely takes a false step  all three cast members play their roles to a tee  with goodman walking a thin line between threat and pathos  while winstead does a terrific job of leading the audience through the increasingly outlandish revelations of the plot  a wildly entertaining genre mash up  after a particularly dull oscar season  this is a refreshing and extremely satisfying palette cleanser  don t give away the secret of this j j  abrams production  which begins as one sort of movie before turning into another sort of movie but manages to be continuously bad  a smart and tense chamber piece that builds suspense carefully  put this down  close this tab  go to your local multiplex and just buy a ticket  even better if you haven t seen more than a teaser trailer  do not pass go  do not collect  200  proceed directly to the theater  
1625,eye_in_the_sky,this riveting drone thriller is contemporary edge of your seat stuff  propelled by a crack cast led by helen mirren as single minded british col  katherine powell  
1626,rogue_one_a_star_wars_story,there are suicide squad level moments of confusion  weak characters and regressive storytelling that left me downright angry  more proof that diverse casts can actually lead to big box office numbers  
1627,tower_2016,the overall absurdity of the piece left me numb beyond belief  why stop here  why not a claymation recreation of the events of 9 11  or jiminy cricket in steven spielberg s when you wish upon auschwitz  this movie is very smart about when it unpacks its interviews versus its recreations  it does it in such a way that i was emotionally flooded  tower is a vivid snapshot of derangement  heroism  endurance and sometimes admitted cowardice on what remains the most traumatic day in university of texas history  a haunting re creation of a first of its kind tragedy  fifty years later  it seems  we re no closer to answers or solutions  no matter how many years later  no matter how cool your animation technique might be   nobody  somehow feels like the wrong answer to that question  deftly combining archive footage  interviews and handsome rotoscoped animation  tower is an innovative documentary account of the mass shootings on the university of texas campus on 1 august 1966  this is a morbid but very original film which manages both to be reflective and dramatic  despite the grim topic  tower offers moments of genuine hope in the acts of bravery and kindness that took place during the siege  the result is a remarkable film that deserves an academy award nomination for best documentary  it brings the terror of those 90 minutes on a sizzling 100 degree august day to vivid life  maitland has created a documentary with a remarkable you are there immediacy  
1628,toni_erdmann,toni erdmann is the fastest and funniest 164 minute film you ll ever see   director maren  ade steers her story with a confident hand  the actors test each other in this splendid chamber piece with a seamless narrative in which ade lets the characters run wild  maren ade s toni erdmann is a testament to the precision necessary for really good comedy  proving that fart jokes  sophisticated black humour and a profound sensitivity to broadly experienced human emotions can     find perfect balance  an offbeat and sometimes off putting german farce drama hybrid that features a father daughter pair that are two of the most fully realized characters in recent memory   full review in japanese  when ade s opus works it admittedly does so with a level of precision and genius that s mesmerizing  making this a modern comedy of heartbreak  forgiveness and family deserving of multiple looks   toni erdmann  has plenty to say about parenting  ambition  feminism and modern happiness  but not enough to justify its absurdly longwinded running time  h ller is amusingly discombobulated as the uptight ines  but the film is perhaps best appreciated as a showcase for the gifted simonischek  whose portrayal of winfried toni is one for the ages  simonischek  all ruddy  playful bearishness  and the amazing h ller allow themselves to sink deep within these two characters  and the end result is nothing short of unforgettable  boasts two fascinating characters and a string of surreal set pieces that you can t afford to miss  the story of a nuttily disguised father stalking his uptight business executive daughter is surreal and screamingly funny  but also a tender dissection of their relationship  force of feeling and intelligence meets force of comic metaphor and invention  somewhere in a dadaist deep space miraculously liberated from solemnity  
1629,the_edge_of_seventeen,steinfeld smartly weighs the comedy of nadine s hormonal disquiet against her potentially tragic need for affirmation  never more adroitly than in a shaded set piece involving an accidental sext  
1630,little_men_2016,there are no cliches here  little men is a deceptively intimate drama that presents itself as a quirky coming of age story  sachs captures the concentrated joy of youthful larks and loyalty but he is as wise as fassbinder ever was to the impact of economic and social pressures on our emotional choices  sachs s preoccupation with real estate may be a trifle bourgeois  but the films that result are finely tooled little gems  this understated drama thumbs its nose at the business of gentrification with delicately calculated movements  following up love is strange with another slice of urban bohemia  sachs  latest is another gem that s full of heart and warmth  beguiling and sad but also a tough pill to swallow  it s about good people reluctantly competing for what they want  and how circumstances can be a friendship s best friend  but also its worst  the film s sheer delicacy exerts a continuing fascination  shoring together small moments from the lives of believable characters  in a manner free of special effects and fluky plotting  and with the same dramatic and visual gusto one would apply to an epic is what independent filmmaking should be all about  as in the films of the french new wave s eric rohmer  nothing cloying happens here  nothing plainly engineered to elicit emotions  but emotions are elicited   moral and ethical concerns are addressed  examined  defined   little men   barely 80 minutes without its end credits  feels right in its size and scope  even when you wouldn t mind an extra beat or scene or two for each character  
1631,under_the_shadow,did you honestly doubt that peeling duct tape and a sheet of printed fabric  if handled with imaginative brio  could be as frightening as any ten million dollar monster  o ye of little faith

1633,embrace_of_the_serpent,crucial for global audiences to see  while guerra clearly owes a debt to herzog and coppola  he blazes his own trail  i can t wait to take this trip again  david gallego s opalescent monochrome cinematography is simply breathtaking and only enhances an utterly magnetic experience  
1634,oj_made_in_america,could one man simultaneously embody such grace and such brutality  sure  just look at the country he grew up in  as detailed as a great history book and as addictive as an airport novel  though simpson himself only speaks through archival news footage and occasional audio recordings  edelman paints a rich  three dimensional  tragic portrait of the man  it s a journalistic marvel  assembling fact after fact and observation after observation into a portrait far more complex overall than it appears at any given moment  
1635,jackie_2016,jackie does what the very best biopics should  it makes you view someone you ve seen countless times as if you were seeing them anew  
1636,the_age_of_shadows,it may not be the helmer s finest film  yet it darts nimbly and appealingly between its slickly delivered set pieces  the action is lengthy but well constructed  particularly a sequence on a wood panelled steam train  but the torture scenes and occasional severed toes may try some viewers  this film certainly believes in giving the audience bang for their buck  although it s a little over extended  a blisteringly entertaining and exquisite genre exercise  kim sometimes loses the rhythm of his spy thriller  but he s such a confident filmmaker and his leading man such a magnetic presence that he quickly gets its back  you d be hard pressed to find a more lavishly staged staged chunk of pulp nonsense  for this director  exposition can t hold a candle to elegantly staged shootouts  and who can blame him  he knows his strengths  the screenwriters  lee ji min and park jong dae  embellish this crafty scenario with no shortage of ingenious complications  effectively doubling the number of double agents at every turn  kim jee woon s gripping 1920s period piece isn t just an homage to older movies  even if it never goes anywhere you don t expect it to  while the notion of a cop and perp who could be friends under different circumstances is nothing fresh  the age of shadows puts its own spin on it  cult director kim jee woon delivers the goods with an ultra stylish cloak and dagger actioner set in 1920s korea  under the japanese occupation  
1637,queen_of_katwe_2016,queen of katwe is still a bright addition to disney s roster  as audiences and actors demand more complex roles for people of color  let s hope we see more groundbreaking projects like this one  when the feel good finish rolls round  you feel it s been fully earned  as feelgood stories of empowerment go  this has a ring of authenticity and mixes intelligence with irreducible emotional immediacy  this disney drama manages to avoid patronising sentimentality with an uplifting and punchy look at the conflicts faced by 14 year old phiona  we already know from his turn as martin luther king jr in selma that oyelowo can be stirring in a statesmanlike role  but here he brings a similar kind of moral conviction to a far humbler underdog character  it is a thoroughly heartwarming story in which you re rooting so hard for the heroine that you scarcely notice how contrived some of nair s dramatic gambits really are  its plot isn t going to win any prizes for originality  but nair tells the story with immense warmth and cheer  you can see just about every move coming  but it s making all the right ones  i loved the way that the film shows so much patience  that it allows things to develop at their own naturalistic pace  director mira nair knows just how to deploy her excellent cast  giving weight to the drama of both mom and coach without ever forgetting her sweet young queen  
1638,fireworks_wednesday,it succeeds  as very few films do  with simultaneously presenting several distinct viewpoints without shortchanging any of them  
1639,aquarius,a performance of tremendous wit  vitality and lusty defiance by snia braga drives brazilian film maker kleber mendona filho s remarkable second feature  sonia braga is wonderful as a retired music writer who lives alone in a gorgeous old apartment by the sea in recife  brazil  i mean no offence  and hope brazilian film maker kleber mendona filho takes none  when i say aquarius could be a stage play  indulgent  occasionally unwieldy  but put together with passion and verve  wonderfully evocative of time and place  this considered assault on brazil s economic and ethical crises revolves around a majestic performance by sonia braga  there just isn t enough content here to sustain the film s length  and though there are moments of brilliance  the conclusion is a disappointment  this isn t a movie about a situation  it s a movie about a fully formed  red blooded character dealing with a situation while also dealing with everything else  this is a film more about the sacredness of our memories than the evil ways of gentrification  but skilled director kleber mendonca filho is clearly interested in both  despite sonia braga s fierce performance as a woman of unbreakable determination and proud refinement  this drama by the brazilian director kleber mendona filho quickly lapses into sentimental attitudinizing   aquarius  makes a compelling case for looking up from our ubiquitous distractions to take in the world around us   the one that we live in and  whether we re aware of it or not  lives in us  filho is a born filmmaker whose storytelling rarely follows expected narrative pathways  and  aquarius  takes its sweet time  focusing on what appear to be inconsequential details and gradually building force by accretion  it may feel like it drags a bit in the middle  but aquarius has so many individual moments of grace that it rewards you for sticking around

1643,the_fits_2016,while leaving plenty unsaid  the fits rarely achieves the thrill of discovery  if the fits are lemons  caused by metaphorical lead poisoning  then toni s amazing closing sequence is lemonade  holmer draws confident  luminous performances from the cast that rise to the occasion but never seem over coached or phony  the fits celebrates young black women  with an accent on their bodies  hard to pin down  but guaranteed to leave a mark  what the movie lacks in narrative it makes up for in mood and invention  slow paced and methodical  filled with arresting long shots  using a lot of real life west end of cincinnati dancers and athletes in the cast lends the film an authentic feel without ever feeling amateurish  and the specificity of toni s story resonates outward  anna rose holmer s strange but beautifully crafted film is worth seeking out  holmer directs with supreme confidence  allowing the film to build to a boil at its own measured pace but not in a way that ever feels slow or drawn out   holmer  and cinematographer paul yee infuse the community center  in and around which the entire film takes place  with elements of magical realism to accentuate the protagonist s passage from childhood into adolescence  the movie is a nearly perfect thing  made with such assurance that every shot holds weight and widens your heart  like its lead royalty hightower  whose performance is just as spectacular as her name  the fits is impossible to look away from  it s gorgeous  poetic  and opaque  and i ve never seen any other movie like it  you honestly don t know what to expect  and when the film is done  you re not exactly sure what has happened

1645,the_beatles_eight_days_a_week_the_touring_years,unearthed fan footage and gorgeously restored concert clips make this a must see for beatles fans  howard assembles eight days a week with an eye to appeasing those knowledgeable about beatles history  the material is uncontroversial to say the least  but hugely enjoyable with some remastered live performances that were previously drowned out by screaming girl fans   howard seems  as if he were intent on making a film for anyone who tuned in to the ed sullivan show in 1964  fell in love with the four adorable mop tops and regrets all the long haired plonking about with sitars that came later  beatles fans will relish this musically rich trip down memory lane  while even the uninitiated will surely be impressed by the talent  humour and  yes  class on display  90 percent familiar and a bit hagiographic as well  but just try watching it without smiling  don t expect trenchant analysis or deep insights into the group s creative process  do revel  however  in the gleeful tumult and the gorgeous music  howard is more interested in wowing audiences with exuberant  hysteria ridden performances than he is in digging for explanations  the familiar events presented here were covered more thoroughly in the band s own 11 hour beatles anthology  though howard has dug up some good ancillary concert footage that illustrates the chaos swirling around every show  as someone who s been a fan since 5  twisting away in my living room to their ed sullivan appearance  there isn t much i haven t seen  or thought i hadn t  but howard still digs up surprises     
1646,hail_caesar_2016,in other words  it s perfect  and like the best of the duo s achievements it s an ending i m going to be pondering for quite a long time to come  the greatest thing about hail  caesar  is that its loose structure allows the coens to just mess around with the things they like  it is  all in all  mid level coens  but as so many others have noted  mid level coens still tops most other filmmakers at their peak  mostly it s about the meaning of life by way of religion  with which the coens have always fiddled  sometimes dancing around the edges and sometimes diving straight into the middle  you could see it as a sampling menu for chez coen  like most sampling menus  however  hail  caesar  leaves you craving a proper main course  as for the coens themselves  eccentric and critical hollywood tomb raiders they might be but  like sturges  they believe sincerely in the value of delight for its own sake  think of altman s the player  mix it with random pages of fitzgerald s the last tycoon  shake and serve  every new scene is a surprising delight in what  at the time  appearing as a sunny  screwball satire pinpointing the moment where the hollywood production line was starting to clank and creak  although it s beautifully crafted  filled with amusing detail and in jokes and cast with the coens  usual deft precision  it all falls a little flat  as coen movies go  this is one of the most upbeat and optimistic  one of the few to suggest that good people can have happy endings  classic hollywood wouldn t have it any other way  the coen brothers  new comedy isn t quite an homage to 1950s hollywood  but it s not a spoof of it either    it strikes that tone of crisp drollness that s their specialty and that some people misread as aloofness or contempt  but it s not  
1647,green_room_2016,its go for broke horror aesthetic a real world cavalcade of terror that had me noticeably shaking long after the film itself had come to an end  
1648,long_way_north,the beautifully animated long way north has an attention to detail visually that evens out some clich s  making it a must watch for families with young girls  the lovely long way north is an old fashioned animated movie  but don t let its unfussy execution fool you  beautifully animated with a delightful paper cutout and oil crayon look that delicately conjures up ice  snow and fog  what it lacks in invention and tension  it makes up in painterly beauty and a kind of tough sweetness that is never in danger of spoiling into sentimentality  long way north is a small scale gem deserving of being seen be as many as possible  the lessons learned mixed with the visually resplendent delights combining to make the film an emotionally optimistic sensation i unabashedly adored  the sort of cartoon discerning parents are constantly seeking to enrich their kids  imaginations  with its simplistic perspective  long way north risks being merely a nice gesture instead of a poetic  ice breaking guide that points towards progress  this tale of a late 19th century russian teen on an arctic quest is undeniably dazzling to behold  but as an epic action adventure saga it must  by definition  be exciting and brisk  it is instead stately and a bit bland  stunning stylized visuals  girl power and a strong rooting interest fuel a wonderfully old fashioned tale  where most post shrek animated films are manic and all too eager to please  r mi chay  s deliberately paced long way north tells its story with clarity and an urgent calm  the characterisation is particularly strong  the goal driven  hard working  clever and brave sasha ultimately wins over even the most hard hearted of navvies  a little dark in its themes for younger audiences  the film still makes gripping viewing  
1649,certain_women_2016,like crossing paths with strangers in real life  i left my interactions with these women mulling over small details and wondering what remained unsaid  
1650,almost_holy,almost holy is a deeply disturbing and shocking documentary portrait of life at its lowest ebb  a telling scene where he gets worked up about the  criticism  of him on his wikipedia page hints at a darker side to his character  and he doesn t take kindly to a journalist querying his vigilante methods  this is a film that challenges us to accept a flawed protagonist  his faults do not negate his charitable work  but it is up to us to decide whether they make him less of a hero  steve hoover peels back multiple layers of mokhnenko s story with artistry and acuity  assisted by a heady and propulsive score from composer atticus ross  director hoover utilizes some tricky spot focus to draw the audience in  and the grim yet entirely appropriate score by atticus ross provides a perfect complement to the events unfolding onscreen  vital viewing   almost holy  captures something meaningfully urgent in the brutal day to day of tough love amid a world of tougher indifference  almost holy has the feel of following an embedded journalist on one of those raw  ground level views of a problem you d never considered before but now  by virtue of good reporting  feels urgent and alive  steve hoover s documentary affords one an unusually intimate glance at the collapsed infrastructure of the former soviet union  hoover s style seems equally fit for a bleak documentary  suspenseful thriller  black comedy  dystopian sci fi nightmare and grisly horror film  steve hoover s outraged documentary follows pastor gennadiy mokhnenko  a furiously committed intervener who drags drug addicted kids into clinics and confronts the pharmacists who sell them codeine  
1651,aferim,its spotlight on racial prejudice has resonance given the current refugee crisis  as does its jaded attitude toward any political or economic change  
1652,the_innocents_2016,an emotionally involving rather than harrowing film  with scenes as beautiful as oil paintings  
1653,sully,neither eastwood s controversial politics nor his worst storytelling instincts could really mess up sully  sully can feel like a dutiful  hagiographic slog  even though its actual running time barely tops 90 minutes and both hanks and eckhart give warm  understated  funny performances in the only two roles developed enough to qualify as real characters 
1654,deadpool,who needs a hero when you can have an entertaining antihero  watching the film is like sitting at dinner with a teen ager who believes that  if he swears long and loudly enough  he will shock the grownups into accepting him as one of their own  it s fun for a while  and then it all becomes deeply disheartening  because calling attention to the more businesslike mechanics of superheroics isn t subversive when you re also playing right into them  it seems less irreverent than self congratulatory  deadpool is everything that hollywood has raised audiences to believe heroes are not  crass  selfish and with a vocabulary that would have made george carlin blush  reynolds has never meshed as well with a character or found a better outlet for his smirking  smart aleck persona  in a landscape where superhero roles are too often seen as paycheck parts  reynolds breaks the mold  too bad his film doesn t  for all the creakiness of its plotting  this is a marvel adaptation mercifully shorn of bombast  there is far more bite in its humour than in last year s ant man  reynolds plays the lead role in an enjoyably freewheeling fashion

1658,marguerite,marguerite s unspeakable voice is counterpointed by cinematographer glynn speeckaert s exquisitely composed tableaux  and the denouement yields more than one surprise  catherine frot gives a heartrending performance as the title character  an aging baroness in 1920s paris who feverishly pursues a classical singing career despite her utter lack of talent  
1659,neruda_2016,this smart  whimsical  extremely quirky and devilishly entertaining portrait of the poet is far from being a traditional biography but it joyfully celebrates the spirit of the man and his momentous times  breathtaking cinematography  but focusing the narrative from garcia a character s point of view would have been far more compelling   love is so short  forgetting is so long   neruda once wrote  if only this pablo were that succinct  it s a clever  analytical film  as opposed to an absorbing one  which holds a funhouse mirror up to its subject in place of a looking glass  the talented director pablo larra n  who brought us a slice of political myth with jackie  is back on his chilean home turf with neruda  a wacky semi biographical take on the radical poet and senator pablo neruda  neruda starts as political cabaret  turns into dark fairytale  ends as a kind of destiny waltz  this is a determinedly playful  magical realist style yarn  tribute is paid to pablo neruda s memory by mixing an exquisite and irreverent cocktail of his passions  poetry  politics and pulp  an unusual and richly enjoyable love letter to a fellow artist and chilean  neruda further marks out larra n as a director of serious range and ambition  this is a serious movie that often feels playful  one that has metafictional ambitions but wears them lightly  you can surrender to the enjoyment of the chase at the film s heart  while not losing sight of larra n s serious aims  calderon and larrain have taken great dramatic license with neruda s story  and the payoff is more than worth the risk  
1660,cemetery_of_splendor,an enchanting interpretation of where our sleeping and waking minds wander  
1661,rams,sigur ur sigurj nsson and theod r j l usson are utterly convincing as the battling brothers whose alienation is expressed more through morosely bearded gesture than drunken buckshot dialogue

1664,our_little_sister,rarely has a film more eloquently captured the universality of human experience  kore eda is one of the most optimistic and humanist filmmakers working today  and even though our little sister isn t quite as finely articulated as some of his previous work  his core compassion for humanity comes through clearly  under a less masterful hand  you d be dying for a fistfight  a sex scene or a gunshot to shatter the calm  but koreeda makes thrilling the rich inner lives of four young women trying to navigate rocky emotional terrain in the wake of their father s death  koreeda allows the action to unfold gradually  and plum wine isn t the only food metaphor enriching his tale  each meal seems like an invitation for the sisters to learn more about each other or to be reminded for good or ill of their parents  audiences softened by hollywood cynicism are bound to be confounded by filmmaker hirokazu koreeda s  after life  like father  like son  gentle  upbeat tone  with a delicate palette and soft tones  the craftsmanship on display is impeccable  but the pulse free drama   think crying over spilled milk   makes for muted impact  while the emotions may be muted  there s still something appealingly heartfelt about the way these siblings find each other  one can t help but cheer them on  beneath its sugar frosted quality  however  our little sister has a singular character of its own  all one needs is a close up of suzu s face euphorically looking skyward  eyes closed  as she rides on a road surrounded by cherry blossoms to grasp the laudable humanity at the heart of kore eda s patient  warmhearted worldview  
1665,star_trek_beyond,the result is a taut piece of filmmaking  with perfectly choreographed action scenes and a rapid fire pace that only leaves time to gasp for air maybe if star trek beyond were stupider it wouldn t feel like such a chore  it does seem strange that a franchise whose original appeal was futuristic should now be treasured entirely as faithfully retrospective  but there it is  this is something that has been missing from star trek for a while  an arresting picture of a shiny  hopeful future worth dreaming of  this third installment in the millennial star trek reboot races along without an idea in its head  often recalling the silly  monster driven final season of the 60s tv show  the movie bounces along  hurtling its heroes over colliding wreckage and into currents of artificial gravity  pausing just long enough for a punchline or a knowing exchange of looks  lin and his cast s clear affection for the material helps temper the familiarity  the enterprise s mission was to explore strange new worlds  this movie s is to give us a smooth ride  the actors work so well together that they reinforce the series  central appeal  this crew is like family  this is the sort of reboot i like because it s there for everyone  star trek devotees will have their specialised views on its place in the 13 film universe  but average viewers will not feel marooned  the movie never delivers on its considerable promise because it s always in such a hurry to get to the next action scene  it s exactly the kind of fun  steeped in effervescent goodwill that hollywood should be delivering right now  
1666,train_to_busan,yeon keeps us guessing until the nervy closing seconds  
1667,life_animated,editor david teague skilfully places original animated inserts and favourite movie scenes to allow us a brief glimpse into owen s wonderful disneyfied psyche  director roger ross williams  storytelling skills are at their finest in an engaging story suffused throughout with emotion that never descends into mawkishness  
1668,lo_and_behold_reveries_of_the_connected_world,lo and behold seems to be stoking fears that our tools are evolving beyond our capacity to control them  which offers an intriguing twist on his usual theme of the indifference of nature  a lesser werner  but still worth dipping your brain into  it s a sporadically fascinating film that dips its toe into many different themes where perhaps it should have chosen to immerse itself in just one or two  he specialises in stories about impossible dreams and defying nature and for his latest film werner herzog turns to the most ambitious  abominable creation of them all  the internet  herzog plays intellectual explorer  notching up points of view like a kid in a cerebral candy store  the unsparing eye feels a little more sparing than usual  the existential pondering ometer goes into the red zone  there will be robots  any of its ten chapters could probably have sustained features of their own  but an overarching vision emerges anyway  even if it s one herzog never states explicitly  the film is saved from mere competence by that herzogian feeling  at once grandiose and self deprecating  
1669,fire_at_sea_2016,though conceived as a humanitarian statement  the movie wouldn t be as memorable or challenging without its quotidian aspect  sometimes real life provides us with symbolic imagery that is every bit as potent and sophisticated as anything you would find in a fictional narrative  
1670,tickled,more meaningfully  tickled offers an anatomy of intimidation that feels particularly relevant for our post gamergate times  
1671,gleason_2016,while the director s vision never strays too far from the positive message that he and the gleasons doubtlessly wish to impart  the movie winds up being most effective at doing what cinema cannot avoid doing

1676,the_lobster,farrell absolutely kills it as david  weisz gives one of her best performances since her oscar winning turn in the constant gardener  
1677,dont_breathe_2016,i never feel totally comfortable watching a movie in which the heroine is punched repeatedly in the face  in wide shot  by a muscle bound psychopath until she blacks out  it s hard to care much what happens to any of the highly unsympathetic cast  plot and character quibbles aside  there s doubting alvrarez s taste for horror  but  while you might hold your breath while watching  don t breathe probably won t give you any lasting nightmares  the film makers work with familiar colours to construct deliciously horrid variations on established patterns   a  taut  appropriately breath stealing new movie that galvanizes the tired home invasion subgenre of horror the way films like the witch and it follows have done for the coven and slasher subgenres  panic room meets wait until dark in this pitiless  uncommonly serviceable horror thriller  for alvarez and sayagues  the film is additional proof these are two guys who know their stuff  and watching them continue to work over the coming years is likely going to prove to be a real  delectably frightening treat indeed  it s visually resourceful and honest in how it sets up and delivers on its shocks  there isn t a single false scare  a home invasion story that is as artfully terrifying as home alone was entertainingly hilarious  you could treat it as a casual primer on suspense film craft  or you can just watch through splayed fingers  like the women who sat next to me at the screening i attended  robbery crews are strongly advised to avoid 1837 buena vista  but moviegoers hoping for a thrill might like to visit  but don t linger  
1678,everybody_wants_some,while everybody wants some   isn t a great movie  there is something comforting about its predictability  self awareness  and ability to basically recapture the plot of every single end of school year beginning of school year teen early 20s storyline  the movie respects its audience in a way few of these coming of age comedies ever do  and while not a home run for linklater  it s still a solid triple off the wall i m certain to still be cheering for throughout the remainder of 2016  there s no storyline  the script just drifts from one vignette to the next as the boys cruise around  ogling girls  haunting the campus night spots and staging a party while their house does its best to remain standing under their assaults  despite its easygoing spirit  everybody is tightly structured  framed by four parties and a countdown clock to the start of classes  for a movie that s pretty much about nothing  it s incredibly well paced and never overstays its welcome  it s as if linklater is bound by a bro code that obliges him to present these guys in a basically uncritical light  there s none of the humiliating gross out humour that dominates modern teen comedy  giving the film an affable  breezy appeal    although  as often happens in linklater land  apparently light hearted scenes are tinged with violence  after his intimate  generation spanning epic boyhood  richard linklater is back with an equally special and magical film  albeit one with a much tighter focus  linklater is too besotted with his male creations to see that they can be divided almost without exception between the bland and the obnoxious  even his usual eye for detail is a little off  i was fed up of them all by the end  i have to say  a perfectly pitched blast of nostalgia  which will transport you to that time in life when the future stretched before you and anything seemed possible  imagine  porky s  as an intelligent character study and you re on the right path  another love letter to the magic hour of adolescence from director richard linklater  can only be described in the same way you might talk about college jocks    attractive  dumb and charming  against your better judgment  
1679,the_little_prince_2016,it is deeply personal and profoundly moving  a sensitive and affecting portrait of humanity  if saint exupry offered readers a petite  queer tasting square of some delicate cake they d never heard of  netflix has served up a familiar  fragrant  well balanced meal  the little prince should make a compelling  if not always fully incisive  case for clinging to the lessons of youth  director mark osborne  achieves  some charming effects    but the computer animated portions that function as a real world framing device are more tedious than fanciful  the little prince depends on its viewers  willingness to go along with twee flutterings like  the stars are beautiful because of a flower that cannot be seen   i m too much of an adult to swallow that saccharine bilge  i guess  it s a film with charm and sweetness  but for me is structurally encumbered by this new present day narrative level  the smarter  zappier modern animated style makes the marionette style images of the past look a bit low octane and quaint  there are only a few     delightful moments in an otherwise muddled movie that feels like three films ineptly grafted together  mr  osborne has done himself proud  what s essential in his film is the singular beauty of the first half  when the film hews to its source material  the results are enchanting  but the predictable and sentimental framing device around the slim tale undercuts the potency of the book s meditations on love and mortality  as fragile and beautiful as the beloved rose guarded by the wee fellow of the title  we ve yet to get a masterpiece level film adaptation of the classic novella the little prince  but if and until that day comes  this will do just nicely  thank you very much  at its inventive best like the creation of a little cloth fox who never speaks but steals almost every scene he s in it does capture the odd  tender wonder of  saint exupry s  world  the whole movie s done with great skill and artistry  and while some of the original story s more philosophical moments have been toned down  they haven t disappeared

1682,being_17,if you can buy into the premise  good luck to you  i didn t  these are characters xavier dolan could have a field day with   just imagine the high pitched screaming matches bouncing off the surrounding mountain landscape  but being 17 is quieter and sturdier than that  what elevates the film is not just its beautiful setting in the french pyrenees but also how the beautiful mountain exteriors serve as a metaphor for characters  inner lives  few filmmakers have portrayed the messy reality of human desire and sexuality as consistently  as elegantly  and as powerfully as andr tchin  ultimately  there s a sense of just one thing after another  linked only by an overarching aura of portent that the characters themselves seem to be complicit in  two masters of naturalism deliver a coming of age story that dares to let its characters chart their own paths  fila and klein are equally good in roles that  while more predictable in outcome  benefit from small unexpected moments  calling to mind the sullen lovers of wong kar wai s happy together  the young men of being 17 are more gestural than verbal  tchin intuitively favors movement over chatter  and he directs his young actors toward intimate  yearning performances  
1683,command_and_control,survivors give gripping accounts of events  while journalist eric schlosser  on whose book the documentary is based  explains that the risks of an accidental nuclear weapon explosion have always been much higher than we imagined  there s an important story to tell here  one about the risks created by the very people and things we employ to keep us secure  but not enough to fill the 92 minute runtime  proceeds like a real life thriller  one with striking parallels to its narrative contemporary deepwater horizon  kenner and schlosser not only remind us of a danger that never went away  but honor the men whose bravery was never recognized  since 1980  our weaponry has grown far more sophisticated  whether the sophistication of its handlers has grown as well is something you ll be pondering after the ending credits roll  robert kenner s stylistic choices amplify the film s fetishistic fascination with the nuclear weaponry itself  equal parts history lesson  cautionary tale and nerve rattling thriller  using all manner of nonfiction devices to elicit both horror and outrage over the precariousness of our deadliest arsenals

1687,the_last_man_on_the_moon,a biographical tale that captures more than just the story  given the wealth of footage available  you can t really go wrong with docs on the apollo era   and yet amongst all that  cernan is compellingly frank about the human costs of spaceflight  tales of remarkable men in extraordinary times  cernan knows how to spin a great yarn  and if you do zone out for a moment  he can quickly reel you back in with the time he nearly died on his gemini 9 mission or the surprisingly fierce politics behind his being chosen for the apollo 10 crew  the film traces cernan s career trajectory  going back to his days in san diego as a hot shot naval aviator  blending terrific archival footage with contemporary perspectives to quietly poetic effect  craig charts the flight path of cernan s life from his years as a naval aviator flying off aircraft carriers in the late 1950s to his selection as an astronaut in 1963 and his trips into space  cernan is clearly still in awe of what america achieved during those cowboy years   but he also speaks  with the melancholy that results from several decades of hindsight  about the havoc it wreaked on the personal lives of the astronauts  cernan is proud of what he accomplished  calling himself the luckiest man in the world for all that he got to see  but he also expresses regret at having done it at the expense of his family  take a pinch of top gun  stir in a generous dollop of the right stuff  add a light sprinkling of mad men and you have the formula for this uplifting documentary portrait of former apollo astronaut eugene cernan  craig s film stirs emotions closer to what cernan exclaimed when first stepping into the lunar dust   oh  my golly  unbelievable   the last man on the moon alternates between archival footage and current interviews  the latter tinged with nostalgia and regret  but craig avoids either lionizing or reducing his subject  
1688,hacksaw_ridge,if they gave out awards for  most movie in a movie   then no other movie need turn up  a rousing tale of pacific war heroism that has more in common with jingoistic wayne staples such as sands of iwo jima or the green berets than anything in the 21st century  this is wearily formulaic film making  vintage mel odrama  mel gibson s hacksaw ridge is one of the best second world war movies since terrence malick s the thin red line  it is also a wildly contradictory affair  combining folksiness with a pathological quality  a sterling modern war picture with an intriguing moral twist  gibson has made a movie that s nearly pathological in its love of violence but he nonetheless counterbalances its amoral pleasures with an understanding of the psychological devastation that war wreaks  hacksaw ridge is a fine motion picture  one whose themes and ideas obviously speak to the filmmaker  and if doss  story has helped change him as far as being a decent human being is concerned  that makes it all even better  as director  gibson s approach is bold and fearless  this represents his best work to date behind the camera  by the time hacksaw ridge reaches its necessary messianic finish  it s hard to not be moved by the boggling heroism of this dutiful man  if the film s director were anyone but gibson  a fixture on or even atop hollywood s enemies list  it would be expecting several oscar nominations

1690,i_am_not_a_serial_killer,enjoyably gory and wry   sinks  its storytelling teeth deep enough to draw blood  while still retaining the flesh wound frivolity of cackling morbid fun  a pleasingly macabre study of a mixed up teen who could be a dexter in waiting  o brien here both successfully reintroduces max records to the world  and elicits christopher lloyd s best performance in a long time  his film deserves cult classic status at the very least  an affectionate  often funny look at small town slaughter  with a killer protagonist for whom it is all too easy to root  the arbitrary value of life in i am not a serial killer makes its nature as an ostensibly character driven mystery that much harder to swallow  a well filmed indie that doesn t let its low budget get in the way of some true chills  the film comes unsettlingly close to being an apologia for the kind of violence that stems from adolescent disaffection  a sticky vein of macabre humour is a key selling point for this genre blurring adaptation of the cult novel by dan wells  
1691,lion_2016,i don t think i ve ever seen a movie that s this much about the experience of adoption and the relation between adoptive parents and adopted children   it s a rich subject that we don t see much in film  despite its wavering focus from its fascinating lead to his white supporting actors  this is an inspiring story about one young man s search for identity if you don t blub at the end  you may wish to secede from the human species  a deeply empathetic performance from dev patel and an unflinching view of child poverty on the streets of calcutta provide a winning edge to lion  has some pacing issues and an overbearing score  but nothing that isn t erased by the swelling  tear jerking crescendo of an ending  robustly made  but very little to gnaw on  director garth davis and screenwriter luke davies throw all the soap suds at the story  the film is moving enough in its own terms but lacks the depth and complexity that might have been expected  an astonishing true story that s treated with an admirably light and artistic touch  rather than an overly dramatic heavy hand  the source material is so rich that it s easy to forgive lion s small flaws when the film treats its characters with such empathy  crucial to these early scenes is the casting of sunny pawar  a marvellously instinctive child actor who gives an indelible performance as saroo  garth davis uses close ups sparingly and hits no false notes  cinematographer greig fraser creates a child s perspective by setting the camera at the hero s eye level and conveys the grandeur of india through sweeping panoramic and overhead shots  
1692,eat_that_question_frank_zappa_in_his_own_words,any true zappa fan will eat this stuff up  for novices it may open up the universe  eat that question  a fascinating and compelling dive into an artist s uniquely ticking parts  gives voice to a complex dude and broadens the picture  there s no small irony in a frank zappa doc being built around the man s interviews  since he regarded journalism as a form of torture  frank zappa was an innovative composer and musician  but as this royally entertaining documentary illustrates  he was also an articulate and opinionated man  high minded and mordantly funny  amusing and even edifying  although it is also unlikely to make converts out of those who just don t get zappa s pastiche of juvenile parody and sophisticated songwriting  derived from rock  jazz and 20th century experimental music  eat that question is a fitting title for a movie that never quite gets at the mystery of zappa s contradictions  even as it stacks up intimate live clips and fierce monologues from a rich trove of vintage interviews  seeing mr  sch tte s film  i m reminded of how much more there was to explain about zappa  and delighted to find how well the film explains it almost a quarter century after his death  along the way  we are given an overview of zappa s career  from his early albums with the mothers of invention through his not particularly accessible classical compositions  along the way  we learn some things that may be surprising  zappa made for a good celebrity if a rotten musician  and his takes on language and fame keep this doc sprightly and engaging  there s no explicit attempt to put forth a grand unifying theory of zappa  sch tte immerses us in the competing aspects of zappa s public persona for their own sake  the results are fascinating  
1693,demon_2016,this is a portrait of poland as a not so sweet little village  unable to move on from small town xenophobia against jews like hana or modern outsiders like piotr  even as its unresolved past returns  like a dybbuk  to reinhabit the present    a paranormal descent into madness and mayhem that s hauntingly good  though it s based on piotr rowicki s play clinging  director marcin wrona s spirited staging keeps it from ever dissolving into canned theater  not only an instant genre classic but also an astute and affecting rumination on the notion that the shades of the past are always with us and can disrupt us to the point of personal and societal collapse  a chilling  eerie cautionary tale about the ghosts that continue to haunt poland long after the war  wrona jumbles several genres together  including dark comedy  to illuminate larger  more ambitious themes  wrona keeps everything creepily ambiguous right up to the end  when the foggy dawn breaks and what we have witnessed becomes like a dream within a dream  it s also so weighted down with mysticism and metaphor it forgets to quicken your pulse or whiten your knuckles  more interesting than the horror imagery is the film s painfully somber message no matter how far we try to run  the sins of history surround us always  the film has a powerful undercurrent suggesting the feverish workings of a troubled yet brilliant mind  whatever demon s autobiographical elements  this film feels incredibly personal  like a howl of pain ripped straight out of someone s soul  
1694,zero_days,it s remarkable how gibney packs complex  jargon heavy ideas into a neat package  this documentary might be better titled day zero  because it features a doomsday scenario in which cyberwarfare shuts down the electricity grids and other networks of entire countries  using computer malware  gibney s new cyber war documentary brilliantly unpacks the story behind the stuxnet virus  created by the cia and us government to sabotage the iran nuclear programme  unnerving and likely to give viewers some bitter food for thought  zero days is gibney s most important work yet  zero days makes clear that we re already enmeshed in this terrifying new cyber reality  and unfortunately for us all  we ll need more than john mcclane to help avert forthcoming global disaster  gibney is surely right in calling for open and informed debate about cyber warfare  but his own movie lacks transparency and persuasiveness  what a terrible moment for this director to go unclear  gibney s movies are professional and solidly executed  informative if you go in underinformed but rarely surprising or aesthetically noteworthy  zero days is     under attack from little stylistic worms that threaten to turn an otherwise solid doc on the evil that 21st century hackers do into a hack job  since no terrorist group or nation state has ever claimed credit for stuxnet  gibney can only hypothesize about its origins  but he makes an alarmingly lucid  if circumstantial  case for the culpability of the united states and israel  director alex gibney does this vital material a disservice  giving it an air of deflated pomposity  in documentary filmmaking  as in news writing  there is a fine line between irresponsible alarmism and dispassionate reportage  and mr  gibney has a proven record of tiptoeing to the edge without going too far  you ll want to see  zero days  just not when you re counting on a good night s sleep a few hours later  
1695,sand_storm,there is a grim sense of inevitability that runs through sand storm  yet jalila s incandescent spirit contains the hope that the old ways are soon to be a thing of the past  rich in cultural specifics but also universal longings  it s a fairly familiar critique of patriarchy from a humanist  feminist perspective  but one put across with some very impressive filmmaking skills by a first time director  as a director  ms  zexer has a fine eye for the texture of daily life  which she fills in with resonant physical details and sweeping  scene setting views  this emotionally intelligent first feature offers a sympathetic but clear eyed look at the tangled skein of inequalities that entrap women  and the men they love and resent  in a bedouin village  the lead performances have power  whereas pictorially the film is pretty rough and ordinary  despite its simple plot  it s a complex drama with characters to match  elite zexer weaves an impressively terse narrative of distinctly motivated characters  but the film s core remains somewhat shapeless due to the routine dramatization  strong headed women spiral out of control against an archaic patriarchy in this scorching and intimate israeli melodrama  
1696,hush_2016,an intelligent thriller that finds almost constant ways to introduce blood curdling tension  it s a sharp  finely tuned thriller that goes down familiar paths but with flair and skill  flanagan doesn t hold back on the gore  but he doesn t rely on it  flanagan s taut direction reinforces his rep as an up and comer we will hopefully be hearing much more from  
1697,the_measure_of_a_man_2016,in scene after scene  briz  exposes with an unrelenting focus the incessant scrutiny that those living in poverty like thierry are placed under by those in positions of power above him  st phane briz  s  the measure of a man  feels so real  you re almost startled when it s over   it seems as if this french drama about a middle aged husband and father facing unemployment should just go on  as life tends to do  the subject is one that will be familiar to working class people all over the world  and is presented by brize and his co writer olivier gorce without a hint of compromise or sentimentality  uncompromisingly authentic  impeccably played and quietly compelling  briz  has cleverly cast people with an extraordinary confidence in front of the camera  which means that lindon s customary minimalist yet charismatic performance style blends wonderfully with the rest of the cast  as 15 minutes turns into a half hour  and then an hour  and then more  viewers will get tired of nodding their heads  the movie makes a point  but it doesn t build on it  lindon brings gravitas and pathos to his role as the french everyman trying to stay afloat in a society that has spurned him  it s a miniature portrait of quotidian desperation that nevertheless speaks to the collective psychic moan of job seekers and those barely holding on everywhere  it s a memorable portrait of a man whose dignity and humanity are slowly pried away from him  until he snatches them back at the end  on this small scale and rather ordinary canvas the human drama is keenly felt  
1698,kung_fu_panda_3,kung fu panda 3 concludes on a definite high note  filled with eye popping animated set pieces as well as thrilling story beats that i was perfectly entertained by  the first two films laid down a distinctive visual template which this pushes ever further into trippy  sliced and diced abstraction  nodding frenetically to the techniques of the wuxia martial arts genre  
1699,microbe_and_gasoline,dramatizing the two boys  respective insecurities and strengths  gondry has crafted a pair of loners who complement each other but aren t so outrageously different that their companionship feels forced  we appreciate the unique personalities of these two kids  and we re glad they found each other  the laughs are sometimes bigger than expected  and so are the emotions stirred by the bittersweet finale  a cross between fran ois truffaut s sometimes harrowing dramas about childhood and a steven spielberg fantasy  gondry s film abounds with sentiment   without falling prey to sentimentality  too flip and sweet natured to be obviously appealing to adult lovers of french art cinema  too digressive  melancholic  low key and gently raunchy to classify as a children s movie in any usual sense  there s no falling back on elaborate shots or effects  any audience knows the road trip movie and coming of age conceits well  and the director makes no attempt to reshape the structure  he trusts the actors and material to do the work  gondry offers up his take on the long running european tradition of unambitious  naturalistic coming of age portraiture  gondry has always worn his heart on his sleeve  which remains endearing   especially when he shows that he still has a few more tricks left up it  
1700,lady_bird,the densely packed detail which makes this such a luminous work shows gerwig to be an uncommonly alert filmmaker  its joyful  forward rushing narrative rhythm captures the feeling of adolescence ending before it has barely begun  as teen movies go  it s supremely sophisticated  capturing and crystallising that moment in adolescence when it seems that life is at last about to start and the only place you want to be is elsewhere  while there is an acute authorial intelligence informing the transitions between scenes  the steady trot of clipped vignettes comes to seem monotonous and somewhat evasive  a way to move along before anything too hard and hurtful happens  like many wonderful actresses with a gift for words  think julie delpy  sarah polley and lake bell  gerwig has slipped behind the camera to create something quietly political  if gerwig is capable of all this in her first solo feature  who knows what feats of woodwork she ll craft for us next  writer director gerwig manages brilliantly the delicate feat of portraying the vulnerabilities and eccentricities of the townsfolk without patronising them  it s almost too hard to write about lady bird precisely because it s so brilliant that no words could possibly capture its spirit and convey why this film absolutely has to be seen  and loved  almost everything here bespeaks gerwig  including the cast s tendency to act one line or dramatic moment with breezy brio  as if already on the run to the next  very gg  
1701,get_out,peele succeeds where sometimes even more experienced filmmakers fail  he s made an agile entertainment whose social and cultural observations are woven so tightly into the fabric that you re laughing even as you re thinking  and vice versa  
1702,wonder_woman_2017,jenkins and screenwriter allan heinberg have created an unassailable icon  one who fits into the pantheon with ease  and stands out like no other  invests princess diana with possibly the most genuinely heroic characterization of any modern cinematic superhero  
1703,dunkirk_2017,masterful visual storytelling on an epic scale  
1704,coco_2017,several times i found myself sobbing without knowing exactly why only to realize why the scene had hit me so hard a few minutes later  
1705,the_shape_of_water_2017,as she did in the under garlanded maudie  sally hawkins reminds us that there is nobody better at turning robust fragility into something other than a paradox  
1706,thor_ragnarok_2017,chris hemsworth releases a comic daredevil spirit comparable to that other dashing australian swashbuckler  errol flynn  cate blanchett s hela is hella mean  hella snarky and hella striking with her hair slicked back into antlers  
1707,logan_2017,another expensive throwaway aimed at milking money out of people who still read comic books  color it stupid  whenever the filmmakers have a choice between cruelly slaughtering characters and letting them live  they almost always choose the cruel path  logan does go defiantly against the grain by favouring melancholic mood and themes of mortality and deterioration over inflated  end of the world stakes or grandiose action pyrotechnics  
1708,the_big_sick,watching this judd apatow produced romcom is like clicking on a for real youtube clip of a kitten juggling spoons  cute  clever  no wonder the big sick has gone viral  not quite life or death viewing  but as good a star vehicle as nanjiani might have wished for  
1709,star_wars_the_last_jedi,rian johnson leavens political high seriousness and fan service tear jerking with enough charm and humour to prevent the last jedi becoming the biggest downer ever delivered at christmas by the walt disney company  as the third act approaches  the crescendo of air punching interludes accelerates  eliciting gasps  cheers and omg whoops from an audience whom johnson treats with respect  affection  and evident admiration  but the biggest thing this eighth chapter does is change where things go next in a fundamental way  
1710,war_for_the_planet_of_the_apes,serkis has invented an entirely new medium of performance   one that pushes the series into a realm that would have blown poor george taylor s mind even more than a half buried lady liberty  if he weren t acting with dots on his face to be replaced by a detailed computer simulation of an upright chimpanzee  it would be all but impossible to deny serkis an academy award nomination for best actor  
1711,the_florida_project,a work that combines boundless energy and childlike enthusiasm with dark social realism  sean baker s wildly inventive style of filmmaking has resulted in the gorgeous masterpiece that is the florida project  little moonee is innocent in every sense that counts  and even her worst misdeeds are fuelled by excitement at the possibilities of life  the world captured by sean baker s lens is colourful and bright  despite its impoverished inhabitants  and he never judges or pities them for their choices  even if you might  here is a movie that shows  not tells  there isn t much of a narrative going on here  but baker succeeds in enveloping the viewer in a very particular place  another superbly sympathetic portrait of marginalised experience from a film maker whose great triumph is that he never feels like a tourist  this is moonee s world  and for a couple of hours at least  we are privileged to live in it  the audience is invited to believe that their lives are devoid of thoughts and motivations beyond hustle and pleasure  and so the movie ends up feeling like a millennial instagram feed  cute  edgy  explosive  pithy  but shallow  the film s sympathetic eye ensures it doesn t exoticise the family s plight  or dip into poverty porn  drunken brawls  pissed off johns and vicious catfights are simply day to day eruptions here  blowing in and out of the motel like the florida weather  vibrant and brimming with vitality  this is empathic towards its subjects but fiercely critical of the system that victimises them  for the most part what you get here are raw  non star performances combined with knockout neon visuals  it seems more casually curious and at times even exploitative in its attempt to center the narrative of a poor  marginalized single mother and her precocious young daughter  the florida project  though  dances deftly around kitchen sink realism and instead looks at this pastel world through the eyes of characters too young to know  or care  that they aren t rich  
1712,baby_driver,oozing menace as addicted bank robbers  jamie foxx and jon hamm are all the more charismatic thanks to bill pope s luscious noir photography  credit jonathan amos and paul machliss for the razor sharp editing  
1713,spider_man_homecoming,a strangely oblivious film  one that undercuts its story with exactly the sort of praise hungriness that its hero learns to overcome  director jon watts has learned from his predecessors that the huge set piece scenes only work with spider man if there s a character point being made  a film that smuggles in a delightfully dorky high school saga under the banner of a too familiar superhero one  the chorus of advance raves has declared that watts has hit the sweet spot  i d call it sweet and sour  an utter gas  a fast and very funny superflick that inserts spidey into the larger marvel cinematic universe without ever losing sight of what makes him unique and beloved  by partially demonstrating what a newer  fresher superhero movie might look like  homecoming ultimately underlines its own genre defined limitations  holland probably has five more years in which to dazzle us  and it ll be a crime if batalon and zendaya aren t by his side  this franchise is now all about peter and his friends  here s looking at you  kids  holland is immensely appealing  young but already very much a hero  my spidey sense tells me he s just right for the job  
1714,three_billboards_outside_ebbing_missouri,perhaps it takes an outsider like mcdonagh to get it right  but by picture s end  a few wrenches of plot unite the deplorable with mildred and lend him a contrived sympathy  mcdonagh takes the audience s loyalty and swings it around  taking you on an emotionally volatile  but fascinating  drive by in rural america  three billboards outside of ebbing  missouri unfolds as a typical revenge vigilantly ploy  and could have stayed so under normal direction and screenwriting  instead  it gets turned into one of the best pictures of the year  the result suggests a greeting card spattered with gore  beneath the little flecks of brain and bone  the hallmark logo is unmistakable  martin mcdonagh has crafted a magnificently rich story filled with complexities and twisting turns   it s an experiential kaleidoscope  three billboards doesn t exactly fall apart  but too many implausible turns and uncomfortable gags impede the hitherto smooth machinery  watching it is like having your funny bone struck repeatedly  expertly and very much too hard by a karate super black belt capable of bringing a rhino to its knees with a single punch behind the ear  the narrative never goes where you think it will go  instead  it takes your narrative expectations and shreds them before your eyes  as usual  mcdonagh is alert to how conflicts are codified into games by opponents who share affinities  funny  brutal and breathtakingly beautiful  two exceptionally raw lead performances  supercharged by a bold script from martin mcdonagh  could make three billboards this year s awards upsetter  but while that is a rage that s exhilarating to witness  it s a rage that s not available to everyone  just as not everyone in ebbing can claim the protection of being considering  good   we still don t live in a world where everyone gets to be angry  despite my reservations  three billboards outside of ebbing  missouri is certainly memorably clever and boldly conceived  and any film that allows mcdormand to strut her to stuff to this degree can t be all bad  
1715,i_am_not_your_negro,its themes are as important today as they were yesterday  especially in the current climate of radical right wing ideas and racist sentiment sweeping trump s america  baldwin re emerges as a devastatingly eloquent speaker and public intellectual  a figure who deserves his place alongside edward said  frantz fanon or gore vidal  
1716,blade_runner_2049,spectacular enough to win over new generations of viewers  yet deep enough to reassure diehard fans that their cherished memories haven t been reduced to tradable synthetic implants  it does something sci fi movies rarely do anymore  and sequels do even less  it shows us things we ve never seen  
1717,hidden_figures,this splashy  feelgood period piece is every bit as enjoyable as a best picture oscar nominated blockbuster could hope to be  
1718,the_disaster_artist,this movie isn t just some hollywood parody or inside joke  it takes wiseau s humanity seriously and portrays him as a wounded individual who wanted to be an all american james dean type hero and not the ogre or villain everyone else saw him as  
1719,mudbound,the players are uniformly excellent  rees notably avoids the blinkered perspective such traditional stories often have  in doing so  she captures the racism of the period in ways both routine and heartbreaking  what really lifts the heaviness of mudbound s story over the top is the excellence of its cast  starting with mulligan  who plays laura as a woman whose adaptability to farm life is more about survival instinct than enthusiasm  this beautifully composed film engrosses from the first frame to the last  breathtaking in its humanity and its ability to build out a fully realised world that never feels antiquated despite its 1940s period setting  elevating netflix s theatrical game  mudbound is a powerful and absorbing film  one that does a splendid job of preserving its literary voice while painting a densely layered portrait of two families in world war ii era mississippi  with great performances across the board and a socially relevant story  mudbound will resonate long after the credits roll  the shifting voices help to create interiority without relying on inelegant exposition  and allow rees to refract broad themes like love  war  and racism through very specific points of view  with an impeccable ensemble  taut tension  striking cinematography and a resplendent emotional intelligence  this drama one not to be missed  mudbound is the work of a filmmaker whose vision is uninhibited  even when it falters through later narrative twists that become almost too much to bear  it s a captivating experience one that we re lucky exists  mudboundis easy to admire but tough to watch at times  it tells a truthful tale from america s not so distant past  the highest compliment i can pay rees is that her movie feels truthful  
1720,faces_places,faces places is the most melancholy yet uplifting buddy movie you ll see all year  the pair makes an oddly compelling harold and maude coupling  touring the countryside in a minibus cum box camera and honoring the locals by turning the facades of buildings into ephemeral open air portrait galleries  
1721,my_life_as_a_zucchini,my life as a zucchini has grace and charm  but what breaks your heart is its mental toughness  the upfront acknowledgement in my life as a courgette that many childhoods play out with nary a hint of magic  sparkle or sugar to help the medicine go down feels unorthodox and bracing  this isn t just good writing  it s humane and honourable  every child here feels like a real human being  and as such is accorded a dignity the world invariably hasn t extended to them in their lives to date  barras succeeds brilliantly in his stated ambition to  make a film about children that speaks to them about abuse and its remedies in today s world   my life as a courgette isn t perfect  some of the adult characters lack nuance  but its attempt to redefine innocence is stirring  the only downside to this charming and disarmingly thought provoking gem is that it lasts a mere 66 minutes  few would complain if a sequel came along  claude barras  oscar nominated stop motion animated feature is as poignant and as well observed a film about the darker side of childhood as you could ever hope to see  i asked myself  why nominate a film like my life as a zucchini for an academy award  after viewing the film  it is a step above the rest for me  as it s unafraid to tackle themes where the other films just scratch the surface  seeing the world through a child s eyes can be pretty eye opening  watching my life as a zucchini  the altogether marvelous and oscar nominated stop action animated film by director claude barras  that world is one you will not soon forget  the movie can be funny and heartbreaking at once zucchini s only keepsake of his mother is an empty beer can though in the end what registers most is the children s resilience when  there s nobody left to love us   this french movie uses remarkably expressive stop motion animation to create an honesty and sense of whimsy that help offset the darkness of the intrinsic story  the film is a real rarity  made even more so by the fact that what has moved us so profoundly are a bunch of pop eyed plasticine figures  
1722,the_salesman_2017,there is perhaps no director more adept at capturing the unfolding stories of ordinary people when the drama of their lives runs away with them  for two thirds of its running time  attention must be paid to an exquisitely realized suspense thriller  it isn t until farhadi borrows a calculable cup of revenge from the death wish cookbook that his souffl  begins to flatten  
1723,logan_lucky,logan lucky is sensational  the fact it stole my heart away with seemingly so little effort whatsoever the greatest heist of them all  a singular film maker returns from a cinematic sabbatical in qualified triumph  we re lucky to have him  though the prison break and heist scenes are slickly and efficiently staged  the film s great strength is its good nature  it would be a fabulously funny and endlessly entertaining summer treat no matter who was making it   though it s hard to imagine anyone making it as well as soderbergh  soderbergh directs with his trademark pace and panache  but to this he adds an obvious affection for his hapless hillbilly heroes  remember how panicked we all were when soderbergh said he was retiring a few years back  thank the film gods  there s always one last heist  it s always supremely watchable  but rarely  if ever  commits itself to genuine jeopardy or suspense  we admire the cheek and chic of how it s done  we wonder quite why it was thought worth doing   logan lucky  is not going to win him any oscars but soderbergh certainly appears to have recovered his zest for filmmaking  logan lucky is like a cheerful sing a long of a movie  sweeping its audience along easily  even if some of the details quickly vanish from memory  
1724,the_lego_batman_movie,as spinoffs go  this one has more than its fair share of super moments  and with so many seemingly sturdy building blocks in place i m curious to see how the studio will continue to piece these legos together in the future  
1725,guardians_of_the_galaxy_vol_2,even as vol  2 proves to be overlong and needlessly complex  with a last act that doesn t merely drive the point home so much as hold you hostage to it  the movie proves endearing  as baby groot s companions battle the tentacular horror in the background  we re treated to the delightful spectacle of the mini veggie juking his way through  mr  blue sky  in the opening credits  disney and marvel haven t learned that less is more  instead they subscribe to the lego movie mentality that  everything is awesome   no matter what   yondu s  presence kicks the idling movie into gear  and into a final third act for which all of the previous meandering can be forgiven   and the talk of family finally accrues the weight the film has been trying to put on it  why should every manner of director hanker to make movies that are  character driven   what a terrible phrase that is  it makes drama feel like heavy labor  what doesn t work  alas  are the big things  the main story involving peter and his real space dad  played by kurt russell  and the romantic  unspoken thing  between peter and gamora  gunn s vision continues to be the most inspired of any director currently working inside of marvel s universe  and like a dancing baby groot i m pretty sure at this point i d jive right along to any beat he chooses to lay down next  the reunion of the guardians cements pratt s mega stardom  he has a shaggy young kurt russell vibe  think big trouble in little china    and russell himself is a great addition to the ensemble  providing a dose of kick back  kick ass action gunn has given us a rousing piece of entertainment with plenty of action  ingenious ideas  and visual effects to engage us at every level  that s as much as anyone could ask of a movie  let alone a sequel  how many times is it funny or unexpected to score an action sci fi set piece with an incongruent  70s pop song  in the first film  it was a novelty  but nothing kills novelty like monotony  
1726,bpm,perhaps more impressively  director robin campillo  squeezes drama from the group meetings  which in most films would be snooze fests  120 bpm understands that conflict is not abuse and that comrades need not be friends  it immerses us in tangled lives of passion and anger on their own terms of tenderness  frustration  charisma  mess  pride  fury  pain  laughter  intimacy and bitterness  the film captures very vividly indeed the urgency and turbulence of the period in which the aids epidemic took hold  however  in our current age in which social media has become the message  bpm is a good reminder that when physical bodies aren t present on the front lines their silence can very well indeed equal death   director  campillo tries to give both personal and political equal weight  or at least equal screen time   and proves more adept at the latter  never have highly regulated meetings to propose policy and review results been so richly engaging   bpm  devotes significant screen time to philosophical debate but also appeals to the senses with graphic sex and a throbbing techno score by arnaud rebotini   bpm  is often exhilarating and ultimately moving  but it makes few concessions to audiences without a strong preexisting interest in its subject  bpm  beats per minute  wrecked me something fierce  campillo s latest a piece of historical fiction that s just as relevant today as it ever was a quarter century ago  a restless  engrossing dramatic portrait of parisian activists fighting the aids pandemic in the early 1990s  however specific its time frame and focus  bpm is not a narrow nostalgia piece  nor will it ever be as long as people are still dying  still being vilified  here  as characters hit the streets for demonstrations  hit the discos to relax and hit the skids when they get sick  you re there with them  pulse pounding out more beats per minute than you might have thought possible  bpm resists becoming a tragedy  even as it documents one  you could say it resists becoming the resistance  too  but there ll always be a chance to make that movie  in the meantime  campillo has given us a hard won  loving look at history  
1727,gods_own_country_2017,but o connor and secareanu give such aching performances that their romance feels real  this enigmatic little film says it all in razor sharp closeups and minimal words 
1728,lucky_2017,stanton s navy veteran quietly dominates virtually every frame  weather beaten as the landscape around his small american town  sounds grim but character actor john carroll lynch s directorial debut is a wonderful and warm meditation on mortality  those gentle jowls  that hawkish nose  those quirky  popping eyes and the incomparable slur of that slow jazz vocal delivery are what keep us in our seats  even when we fidget a bit  john carroll lynch  who s worked with everyone from martin scorsese to albert brooks  doesn t explicitly borrow from any of his directors  though it s clear from his careful precision that he learned a little something from all of them  
1729,kedi_2017,humans can only draw so many lessons from cats

1731,it_2017,doesn t cut very deep and isn t very scary  
1732,your_name_2017,beautifully animated  we re talking studio ghibli standards here   your name captures that sensation of waking up from a dream you wish lasted longer  or misplacing a name that s still warm on your tongue  but has just departed  by the time your name reaches its final half hour or so  the film has moved so far beyond its initial premise that if you think back to the beginning  you ll be astonished by how far it s come  throughout  there is the nagging sense that the whole thing will unravel if any one thread gets tugged too hard  but when both the heart and the sky are on fire  why lean in and go squinting at flaws  with its balance of grounded emotion and wondrous escapism  your name should firmly establish shinkai as an auteur to follow for many years to come  this concept could be used for stock shenanigans worthy of a john green novel  but shinkai unleashes a twist early on so clever and cerebral that j j  abrams and christopher nolan will kick themselves for not thinking of it first  it s thoroughly charming and gently comic and  if mr  shinkai finally plays it safe about what it means for an adolescent boy and girl to trade bodies and lightly toy with gender  he complicates the story in other ways  the movie s spirit is by turns energetic and serene  impetuous and wise  its wild shifts from comedy to tragedy to romance revealing themselves not as tonal swings so much as variations in a larger cosmic pattern  a beautiful  captivating piece of work that gets off to kind of a rocky start but achieves remarkable momentum toward an emotional  powerful ending  the way masashi depicts wind blowing through grass or a falling star illuminating the sky makes any dream  however convoluted  seem real  your name is the most beautiful anime since patema inverted  with which it shares themes about the difficulties of personal connections as represented by inexplicable cosmic phenomena  
1733,jane,perhaps we ve all been spoilt by  blue planet   but that original footage doesn t feel strong enough stretched out over 90 minutes  
1734,good_time,good time isn t an exuberant or happy go lucky emotional ride  rather it s the cruel irony of white privileged in even the lowest rungs of class  nick s character doesn t exactly develop  but we do see its innards teased gradually apart  ben safdie s touching performance bookends the film with enormous grace  the masterstroke of the script is how it takes a situation that  in almost any other film of this type  would be played for pathos    and instead strip mines it for every last iota of moral ambiguity  robert pattinson finally drives a stake through his image as the moony hunk from twilight with this convincing  career shifting performance   his finest to date  few of the characters have the first idea what might be coming next   nor do we  strapped into this feral shaggy dog story the safdies have set rolling  hurtling towards their brilliant future  an intoxicating downer odyssey  good time follows in the footsteps of martin scorsese s mean streets  the action keeps up a relentless pace as new characters are introduced  forget twilight and kristin stewart romance rigamarole  those days are done  pattinson s take on a queens dirtbag with an adrenal gland on overload proves he s the real deal  this isn t conventional hollywood horror thriller  suspense  but something more primal  pattinson s performance is one of the year s finest and a revelation for anyone who has wanted to pigeonhole him as an actor  pattinson is what helps us keep pace  he completely inhabits connie with his jittery  twitchy efforts   he can t stand still  so neither can we

1736,city_of_ghosts_2017,a clearly significant document  bringing compassionate immediacy and personalised humanity to an unfolding catastrophe  
1737,dawson_city_frozen_time,we come away with a contemplative suspicion that we re all participating in something  and even if we don t ever get to see the big picture  there probably is one and it might even make sense  this film tells two stories  both fascinating  morrison s purposeful editing and story sense make frozen time a mesmerizing tale bill morrison  whose extraordinary documentary decasia turned decomposing film stock into the stuff of avante garde reverie  returns with another staggering journey into the past  an instantaneously recognizable masterpiece  i miss the weird  metaphoric entropy  which morrison would always score but not narrate  but watching this forgotten history happen is cool  too  documentarian bill morrison delivers a worthy follow up to his classic 2002 film decasia with another cinematic tone poem dedicated to the glories of silent cinema  while the film s purview may suggest a pbs documentary  the density of morrison s detail and the twists in his long game storytelling make for a constant titillating simmer of discovery  a secret history round every corner  
1738,the_work,never has a 4 000 year old aphorism seemed more devastatingly of the moment  but the results are inspiring  it seems the work works  sceptics may enter folsom with suspicion  but these are extraordinary scenes  so shocking and dynamic they might be mistaken for exorcisms  more than just an advertisement for the process depicted  the work carries a profound  implicit point about a culture that encourages men to bottle up what they feel  then condemns them after those emotions express themselves in violent  destructive ways  by simply watching the participants talk about their feelings  sometimes in the vaguest of terms  mcleary illustrates how men build strong faades to conceal their pain from others and themselves  in its visceral purity  the film drags male toxicity up into the light  offering it as a cure for itself  jairus mcleary s stirring documentary is a riveting account of folsom prison s unusual way of rehabilitating inmates  through a group therapy akin to an exorcism  there s something indescribably moving about watching grown men   at least one of whom has tried to cut another man in half   wail and sob  just spending time with this motley crew makes the world seem a saner place  for the open minded this is moving  even wrenching viewing that might inspire similar approaches in british institutions  this is not just an exercise in soul searching by a group of overprivileged navel gazing males enjoying a bonding session in the woods  but a rather touching  enlightening and at times harrowing experience  the work chronicles a kind of breakneck psychoanalysis in which the origins of problematic behavior are dramatically expunged in public  
1739,bright_lights_starring_carrie_fisher_and_debbie_reynolds,self deprecating bon mots  wordplay  song lyrics and perfectly timed occasional moans are what elevate this beyond simple  keeping up with  material  
1740,after_the_storm_2017,as ever  the director has fashioned a lovely  appealing  lightly comic film that exists somewhere between late ozu and early spielberg  hirokazu koreeda s bittersweet comedy about three generations of a japanese family is a gentle delight  this isn t a weepie but as you realise what s happening you may want to cry  there is such intelligence and delicacy in kore eda s film making  such wit and understated humanity  no one makes family melodramas quite like japanese director hirokazu koreeda  his style is deceptively low key and matter of fact even as he deals with seismic moments in the lives of his protagonists  proof that the japanese maestro deserves to be the metronome of all movie lovers  hearts  no modern filmmaker has as sure a grasp on family dynamics as hirokazu kore eda  kore eda s very fine film is almost painfully honest in its even handed depiction of this character  and never seeks to condemn him  a quiet character study of a man in slow motion crisis  the director keeps his characters and audience bobbing together over waters that grow deeper and deeper  until it s impossible to distinguish the everyday from the profound  kore eda aims for the sentimental  but not without acknowledging the real pain and wretchedness in the world    especially when it s exhibited by those closest to us  kore eda looks sensitively at the deep roots of unquenched anguish  but he constructs the characters too neatly and the situations too precisely for the drama to seem like anything but a well meaning lesson  
1741,truman_2017,not your typical cancer drama anchored in grief  instead a clear sighted journey that makes demands on one s emotions in the most unlikely ways  there isn t a mawkish moment to be found  though there are plenty of lovely  humane ones  as well as some that are quite funny  this well made  low key drama  written by mr  gay and toms aragay  offers some insights into terminal illness  this spanish argentine drama  2015   set in madrid and framed by a four day visit from the actor s witty old friend  javier cmara   is pitch perfect  its comic drollery rooted in character and its awkward  poignant good byes credibly staged  the film s real triumph is in how accurately it captures the intricacies of human relationships  especially when tested  a quiet humour suffuses this tender insight into the importance of friendship  camara and darin contribute outstanding work here  a beautifully meshed pair of performances that reveals nearly everything you need to know about the characters and their inner lives through exchanged looks  shrugs and the odd arched eyebrow  a clean lined  sensitively written and beautifully played two hander that tackles complex issues in a refreshingly straightforward  downbeat way  gay s picture proves once again that one can construct a comedy out of such material  as long as one respects the subject matter and refrains from being gimmicky in order to feel edgy and cool  
1742,strong_island,ford s building blocks are familiar  but this is no call to action film or how to guide for getting answers and moving on  ford is so gifted at taking old photographs and interviews and making a movie that is always beautiful to look at  a view of systemic racism through a highly personal and artistic lens  strong builds a poignant  methodical portrait of loss  telling william s story won t bring him back  but at least it will let the world know he lived  this documentary is important  not just as personal investigation  but as a statement against official records  the countless cases where indictments aren t reached  where cases are closed  where young people are pressured to take plea bargains  there are questions that circle around themselves  endlessly  providing no broader outlook  however  by the same token  it is that very lack of objectivity that makes strong island the experience that it is  it is a very tough film to shake  the doc is a demanding  wrenching watch  an important work  if not necessarily one you d recommend to your friends  if the excerpts from the diary leading up to his death don t break your heart  you probably haven t got one  ford is more than a witness he is a crucial participant in the events of the film  and its elements of pain and guilt are reflected in his grief stricken  self interrogating aesthetic  truly special  especially as it moves towards its final act  in which yance begins to wonder about his own actions before william jr  s death  and how they might have contributed to the situation  the documentary won t bring william ford back  and it may give yance ford some catharsis  but more importantly it could and should lead to greater justice and empowerment  
1743,whose_streets,it s likely not even the most well intentioned and determined news crews could gain the kind of access and give us the unfiltered viewpoints provided by the smart phone visuals and home video camera footage shot by residents of ferguson  this is direct and frequently powerful filmmaking that doesn t much care about meeting my aesthetic standards  even through this more personal lens  folayan and davis take an evenhanded approach  civilians loot stores and burn police cars  whereas police officers fire tear gas and aim rifles at peacefully protesting crowds  
1744,my_journey_through_french_cinema,this is essential viewing for cinephiles and francophiles alike  but others may find the three hour plus running time a little excessive  more distinctive and revealing are the fannish tributes to tough guys jean gabin and eddie constantine  innovative composers maurice jaubert and joseph kosma  and forgotten auteurs edmond t  gr ville and pierre schoendoerffer  it perhaps emerges that  the more interested an artist is in a whole variety of different things  the less they may need to impose a single stamp on every work they create in response  whoever you are  you ll learn a lot  it would be a shame if the film were to be seen only by those already interested in french cinema  anyone with an eye for grace  industry  resilience  rich shadows  and strong cigarettes should go along  tavernier pays homage to the rich tradition of commercial yet personal  elegant but observant cinema that had already given french film a name before godard and company drew up their canonical map  detonated their explosives and reassembled the pieces  i was glued to the screen from start to finish and when it was over i wanted more  if you love film you can t afford to miss the experience of seeing bertrand tavernier s journey through french cinema  especially on a theater screen its explanatory title doesn t begin to convey just how exhilarating or inspiring a documentary this truly is  and how excellent a trip this well respected french director takes you on  a passionate  opinionated  drop dead fascinating documentary essay about that country s film history put together by a clear eyed enthusiast who was born to tell the tale  bertrand tavernier s exquisite documentary consistently avoids mere hagiography by looking to the films themselves

1746,menashe,it s a film that just keeps getting stronger as it goes  unfolding almost imperceptibly and becoming deeper with each scene  it goes within one of the world s most filmed cities to discover an environment rarely revealed to outsiders  but it also wins kudos for the emotional honesty of its uncomplicated narrative  this terrifically authentic look at life inside new york s yiddish speaking hasidic community is a bittersweet treat   a vibrantly engaging portrait of down to earth lives that is affectionate  amusing and ultimately very moving  whatever pickle he gets himself in  we can t help but root for menashe  menashe is a deeply felt and absorbing yiddish language drama about new york hasidic jews  a brave step into uncharted territories  the superb leading performance from menashe lustig elevates this beautifully observed film  well worth your time  doubling as a fascinating look at a subculture that is normally sealed off from the rest of us and a gently amusing comedy of manners  this manages to say an awful lot by  paradoxically  saying it endearingly gently  weinstein brings a palpable authenticity  attributable in part to a cast made up of local non actors  to this universally resonant story  rendering it unique and specific in a meticulously detailed setting  the subtle on screen chemistry between father and son gives this sweet and poignant drama a solid emotional base  delicately woven and sensitively told  director writer joshua z weinstein s ode to a shlemiel rings true  in scene after scene   menashe  strikes complex notes without telegraphing how the audience should feel  at times sweet  but never patronizing  menashe examines a world that might seem foreign or oppressive without ever turning its inhabitants into caricatures or figures of fun  
1747,graduation_2017,by shining a spotlight on the everyday corruption and dirty dealing  mungiu enables us to understand just why his homeland is struggling to escape from the weight of the dictatorship that ruined it and betrayed its people for so many years  it feels like nothing s happening until you realize everything is  right before your eyes   graduation  is a masterfully composed effort that is instantly fascinating  moving towards its emotionally hushed conclusion with breathless  if still unhurried  intensity  mastering a movie equivalent of a detached first person point of view  mungiu unearths hidden depths in the supporting characters while creating a three dimensional portrait of romeo as a man who no longer lives in quiet desperation  writer director cristian mungiu continues his expert evisceration of his native romania  and by extension  this whole rotten world and the people who make it that way  even as they convince themselves otherwise  graduation may not occupy a place at the top of the class of contemporary eastern european cinema like some of mungiu s other films  but it definitely sits above the curve  this is a tough film that deals with serious issues  and that may hurt its box office chances  but  graduation  will probably be around long after less challenging fare is forgotten  mungiu eschews music almost entirely  his takes run long enough that viewers are forced to take in the frame s details and figure out which are important  and his flatly matter of fact conversations almost never include obvious exposition  it s consistently absorbing and well acted  and mungiu s camera makes even simple police station interrogations or drive around sequences unassuming things of beauty  the writer director  mr  mungiu  is a master of ramification  his films start off as plain tales  told with seeming simplicity  then they deepen into complex psychology and spread out into contemporary culture  bleak  naturalistic and flawlessly acted   graduation  distills the mood and moral decay of a place whose gray skies and nondescript housing blocks feel like permanent reminders of its dark history  mungiu is almost sadistically patient in letting this play out  by the last 40 or so minutes you can more or less see where it s all headed  even if it s through your fingers  
1748,raw_2017,julia ducournau s feature film debut raw joins the canon with the french teen cannibal  coming of age story i didn t know i was waiting for  ably assisted by marillier   and ella rumpf as justine s controlling sis   ducournau captures the more quotidian dread of fitting into cliques  losing your virginity and living up to family expectations  the picture justifies the feminist analyses it will inevitably generate  it also offers much disgusting fun  some may claim the film is about a young woman discovering herself  but the writer director s obvious delight in shock for shock s sake constitutes a major turn off  no matter how efficiently made or well acted the film may be  directed with the same cross genre dexterity as kathryn bigelow s seminal vampire western near dark  raw is a thrillingly confident and vigorously executed work  the intelligent  deliciously repellent raw stays with you long after the sight of a nice trainee vet snacking on a fellow student s severed finger has gone  its power   its shuddering  relentless intensity   lies in the way it makes you vicariously feel both her dual hungers  and surreptitiously relish every sticky  illicit bite  the plot lurches from gross out to gross out with little wit and less logic  a classy french belgian horror with an unusual female perspective on monstrous taboos  shocking but not sensationalist  this is a strong cannibal movie worth chewing over  a coming of age tale like you ve never seen  julia ducournau s  raw  left me intrigued  mildly nauseated and extremely curious about what passes for recreation at french veterinary schools  this gruesome french horror flick  2016  functions more as a mystery than as an action film  with an endless drip drip drip of revelation that gradually exposes a terrifying world behind the everyday  its command of tone is constant  even in the film s darkly droll final moments  during which you may not know whether to laugh or gag  
1749,quest_2017,there is no grand narrative or point to be hammered home  instead  olshefski delivers a subtle  sincere and honest portrait of barely making ends meet in modern america  it is a rare fly on the wall documentary that doesn t generate some ethical dilemmas  olshefski had chosen his subjects well  quest makes it clear that some things endure beyond political events  
1750,step_2017,rest assured audience members will be thinking about step long after it s over  no movie has lifted up my soul this year as much as this one has  no movie has had me crying tears of pure joy in quite the volume this one has  director amanda lipitz takes viewers home with the students and creates palpable drama around their quests to attend college following their senior year  there are quite a few moments in step that will reduce you to mush  and not because lipitz exploits those things that make life difficult for young black women growing up in baltimore  just blocks away from where freddie gray was killed  
1751,dina_2017,filmmakers antonio santini and dan sickles mostly let the couple s routines and journeys paint their own emotionally dappled picture  sweet without being sappy  the film extends an uncommon empathy to two characters that colder films  and  as we see  people  would treat as a punchline  there are moments of humour in a gently affecting story that celebrates the ordinariness of its subjects  co directors antonio santini and dan sickles tell the story gracefully  doling out dina s tragic backstory in excellent increments  sickles and santini excel at constructing a respectful  but never cold or clinical  distance from their subject  using long takes to let her explain herself in her own words  dina offers it s audience far more than they bargained for without being moralising or predictable  powerful film making  executed with subtle style  even if approached with more than a few misgivings   dina  is valuable if only to offer viewers an honest  touching  ultimately optimistic portrait of people embracing intimacy and honesty the best way they know how  it is a beautifully shot  coolly composed movie  in which the principals emerge as intensely likable and intelligent  a poignant snapshot of marginalised lives  although there may be no fairy tale endings  by the movie s end it s impossible not to wish one for dina and scott  it s rare for filmmakers to get so close to any couple  but a special sort of caution comes with watching the lives of people whose view of the world might be far from our own  the film is mostly happy to stay in its sweetly mundane lane  but not without keeping a couple dramatic and moving bumps waiting down the road  what redeems dina is the fullness of the woman herself  who s managed her disability and survived a mortal threat in order to open up to the possibility of a long term relationship  
1752,the_happiest_day_in_the_life_of_olli_maki_2017,this classically styled romance serves as an intoxicating reminder that historic sporting events invariably have a human side to them  
1753,the_red_turtle,small children often experience the world as simultaneously solid and fantastical  de wit s beautiful film tugs us into that mindset  
1754,the_meyerowitz_stories,you have to wonder about a writer director who wishes his characters would just shut up  i thought that was my job  while this episodic film  configured like a short story collection  think j d  salinger s glass family   is laser pointer specific  its tensions are universally relatable  and its performances are first rate  you need a big screen to savour these effects as well as these performances  particularly sandler  who discovers deep pockets of vulnerability in his familiar comic rage  and the aptly named marvel  who is one  it s a balancing act so delicate  you all but hold your breath  baumbach sketches out the intra family conflicts with aptitude  making sure there s enough lightness to avoid a spiral into the kind of grim and humorless affair the french are fond of  but there s an element of familiarity to the overall narrative arc  we enjoy the meyerowitz clan  even as we praise the heavens we re not like them and we don t live next door to any of  em  baumbach is particularly adept at finding the humour in what could ve been tragically sad situations  for all of his characters  flaws  baumbach is generous  never playing them for caricatures even though it would ve been all too easy  it might call to mind woody allen or j d  salinger along the way  but in the end  this is pure baumbach  from its compassionate analysis of broken families to its empathetic insistence that even the most broken can still find redemption  i loved this movie from the moment it started  writer director noah baumbach hits many resonant notes in this perceptive screenplay about a dysfunctional family  a rich drama about parental ties  parental scars and getting on with life  
1755,in_this_corner_of_the_world,it would be great if a story about imminent nuclear warfare didn t feel quite so relevant  but this quietly powerful anime gives us reason to hope  sunao katabuchi displays a vivid  shattering awareness of how domestic routines can spiritually ground one during a time of demoralizing chaos  
1756,i_daniel_blake,whichever side you come down on  johns  and squires  low key performances are impressive  and the technological red tape hurdles their characters face feel stingingly accurate  writer director ken loach has been making movies about the british working class since the mid 60s  and this masterful dramatic feature proves that even after all these years he can still work himself up into righteous  white hot rage  brims with spirit  sympathy and candor as it tackles the catastrophic displacement brought on by economic and technological change  utimately this political film s sentimentality and transparency detract from its power  a film of empathy  grace and wit that goes a long way to explaining the populist anger so emblematic of these times  there s a heightened edge to i  daniel blake  an embittered streak of comedy that keeps the otherwise miserable plot from weighing too heavily  this new ken loach landmark sums up everything that has kept his muckraking motor running for decades  an old school social realist  the 80 year old filmmaker again speaks up for the exploited lower classes  loach s film isn t as stridently political as it probably sounds  these are just proud people who want to be treated with respect  loach s low key naturalism  which barely masks his fury at the injustices perpetrated on screen  is matched by dave johns s performance as daniel

1758,ex_libris_new_york_public_library,for the last half century  wiseman has never stopped looking outward  but this could be his unwitting self portrait  if only all study sessions were as enchanting as this  there are so many wonderful activities of compassion that wiseman captures that my heart burst about a dozen times  a conservative estimate   three hours plus is an absurd amount of time to sit through the visual equivalent of thumbing through the nypl s program guide  ultimately ex libris demonstrates that libraries are about people  and what gives the film its great and accumulating force is that people are infinitely complex  maybe one temple of learning will inspire a visit to another  see the movie  then pop into your local biblioteca  ex libris s graceful exit suggests that wiseman always knew exactly where he was headed  one would be quite wrong to regard frederick wiseman as a mere observer  rather than the agent provocateur he is  the huge canvas becomes an inadvertent self portrait of this most self effacing of auteurs  whom one senses entirely shares the nypl s noble aims and belief in the power of education  community and hard work  
1759,1945,set in a specific time and place  1945 also resonates as a story of people doing terrible things to other people in the name of opportunity and getting ahead  it hits home at a time when the idea of loving thy neighbor feels sadly pass   1945 serves as both a reminder of hungary s complicity in the holocaust and as an examination of what happens when an entire community is asked to keep one horrible secret  this film adds to a growing list of holocaust dramas and documentaries that move past the guilt of nazi germany to ponder the complicity of smaller communities in eastern europe  features an intrusive sound design  including tibor szemz  s jarringly contemporary score and sound effects that include the ringing of a clock tower  buzzing flies  rumbling thunder and noisy birds    the resultant sensation of uncomfortable prying underlines the boiling suspicions that power the plot  the fractured rhythm of 1945 and the desolate aesthetic are engrossing  but ferenc to ro k s film doesn t linger  in this twitchy  claustrophobic view of moral degeneration  it becomes apparent that this town is not so much convulsed with guilt as with defensive anger  a fresh  intelligent cinematic approach to a difficult topic that takes on a transitional time in hungarian history with subtlety and nuance  
1760,a_quiet_passion,davies doesn t shrink from the challenges this darkened mood poses for his audience  
1761,felicite_2017,the meandering narrative has a lyrical quality consistent with the many musical numbers  think high noon set in kinshasa and backed by a congolese beat  this heady trip into downtown kinshasa is as magnetic  and enigmatic  as its forceful central character  a heroic  award winning central performance from the congolese actress v ro tshanda beya mputu is reason alone to see this often gripping  occasionally infuriating french language melodrama  it s a film with seriousness and compassion  though a little lengthy and diffuse  dramatic storm clouds gather and pass overhead without ever quite bursting into rain  f licit  has a lyrical spirit that worms its way to the surface even at its most directionless  the film s tonal range is formidable enough to suggest that this director may be a major talent who s now emerging from relative obscurity  f licit  is a work of art  it is also the anguish in everyday day survival when you are losing your will to live that makes the film largely captivating  alain gomis never reconciles throughout how the film s disparate parts are meant to fit together  it s intense if somewhat choppy filmmaking  although the passion of the amateur cast and vividness of the kinshasa locations help make up for the narrative shortcomings  
1762,the_last_laugh_2017,an eye opener in every sense 
1763,dolores_2017,it s a powerful  provocative filmmaking that could potentially inspire a new generation of dolores huertas  using powerful archive material  the film chronicles huerta s life and triumphs  with dolores  we re getting the lesson we deserve  what s clear is that after watching dolores  this woman becomes an unforgettable figure in the annals of mexican american history    hagiographic but still lively and informative  this documentary by peter bratt shines a spotlight on a historic  relatively overlooked figure    her social activism often left her children  some of whom are interviewed  in the lurch  it s a contradiction the film could have more sharply explored  bratt and his collaborators clearly admire their subject  while recognizing that the struggles and some possible contradictions don t make her a weaker leader  huerta is such a commanding figure  and the array of historical footage marshalled on behalf of her story is so impressive  that the film makes a strong impression  as a girl  she says  she had wanted to be a dancer  in some way you can see that in her work  she has made activism an art form  with any luck  dolores will move the needle  enlightening viewers about the formidable huerta and raising awareness of her rightful place in civil rights history  bratt fleshes her out in fullest political and social dimension  but also captures her personal life and driven personality  
1764,montparnasse_bienvenue,is the woman whose adult capabilities are a thin veneer over hysteria a rebellious threat to patriarchal expectations  or a perfect product thereof  there s a white knuckle sense of emotional freefall powering every fraught scene  two mesmerising portraits for the price of one  it s like a film that philippe garrel might have made  although paula isn t a thousand miles from agn s varda s cl o  thrillingly capturing both time and place and fizzing with non judgemental empathy and cinematic flair  this is a magnificent debut that catapults laetitia dosch into the front rank of french actresses  i was bowled over by its dynamism and comic brio  and cautiously suggested that laetitia dosch might be considered   france s answer to greta gerwig  she brings to jeune femme the kind of irreducibly intense charisma that gerwig brought to frances ha  snappily edited  and shot with intimacy and imaginative framing  the energetic jeune femme also skips along to a suitably spirited but melancholic electro soundtrack from composer julie rou   serraille is less interested in neatly resolving plot strands than she is in depicting the furious moment with all its colour and confusion   a state cinema rarely captures

1766,the_b_side_elsa_dorfmans_portrait_photography,elsa dorfman s work is ephemeral yet grand  using a giant 20  x 24  camera  that is now discontinued  dorfman has produced some of the world s largest polaroid images  showing that unwieldy technology does not need to be limiting when used imaginatively   elsa  dorfman s a fascinating character whose sunny demeanor  much like her generally cheerful photos  contains hidden depths  morris  film also functions as an elegy for polaroid and the large format imagery that has now ceased to exist as a result of the company s demise  more than any of morris s films  the b side is directly about the mystery of capturing a person s identity on film   this likeable close up portrait may not be one of his most substantial films  but it s his most likeable and most casual  there s a lot more movie contained within this charming oddity  but only for those who are willing to look deeper  a fine grained  no photography pun intended  look at the way that the development of an artist s style is usually intertwined with the technology and materials that she chooses to embrace  you can almost sense morris smiling off camera as she pulls each exposure from her file drawers for reminiscing and newfound scrutiny   that s how strong and warm his admiration is for dorfman and the humble richness of her work  if errol morris  new film is a relatively minor work by his standards  then its bittersweet  faintly lilting tone is here to remind viewers of the big heart that s always been there in his oeuvre  this film will convince you that she definitely deserves a higher position in the pantheon  if this doc is sometimes elegiac in tone  there is nothing mournful about it  her stories are great  especially the one about dorfman gate crashing dylan s rolling thunder revue in 1975  it would have been nice to hear more of them  
1767,thelma_2017,the scary moments are there  but they take patience  and then they take you by surprise  as a hushed  haunting portrait of a young woman reconciling daughterly duty and her own incipient power   thelma  feels like a stylish  timely allegory for the present moment  trier has found a new way to depict and talk about these emotions and experiences that most human beings know and can never really get over  his way is cold  deadpan  extreme  and very scandinavian  and it s effective  if you ve ever held something deep down that nearly ruined you  then you ll relate to thelma s plight  while the film doesn t entirely deliver on its start  the overall mood remains pricked by a similar sense of doom and shivering unease  enriching thelma s chaos is the director s refusal to outright censure any of his characters  no matter the sometimes awful choices they make   thelma  exerts a grip of its own  not least when it presses against other genres  leaching details from both science fiction and horror  the level to which trier is willing to lay thelma emotionally bare is just as heartbreaking as it is harrowing the dread in thelma is not so easy to pin down  coming as it does almost totally through trier s choice of visuals  there s too much undeniably impressive filmmaking to dismiss thelma  there s too much uncertain storytelling to actually recommend it  trier is a ingenious filmmaker  and he makes thelma visually compelling even when the story lazily turns to the usual scare flick tropes  
1768,girls_trip,it s a raucous ride  unlike anything i ve ever seen in theaters  girls trip is better plotted than the similarly themed  scarlett johansson vehicle rough night from earlier this year  it has a looseness to its structure that helps the momentum move from one crazy set piece to the next  there have undoubtedly been more polished  stylish movies released this summer than girls trip   even among comedies  but were any of those movies this much fun  it s loud  at times unwatchably gross and sometimes lingers on the verge of hysteria  but it s also a warm hearted and optimistic celebration of black womanhood  maybe friendship can save us all  some of the comedy veers into the absurd  but each joke squarely hits its mark  there s nothing embarrassing about the posse in girls trip  which depicts the friendships these characters have sustained not as vestigial remnants  but as a guiding force toward being true to oneself  the movie is about a group of old college friends who take off for a long overdue girls  weekend in new orleans  but  thanks to the smart script and lee s slick direction  we re emotionally invested in each of their journeys  paired with a few good friends and a strong beverage or two  it s an absolute scream  what girls trip does have going for it is an irrepressible energy and an absolute lack of embarrassment about its own crudity and pants down humour  no film with a cast this strong could fail to raise laughs  but the actors are wasted in a huge bloated mess  throughout the film  there s a sharp specificity to the women s various emotional travails that cuts across its occasionally baggy construction  while conventional comedy fodder  girls trip surpasses all expectations with its ability to remain unapologetic even when you expect it to dial the gross out jokes down a notch  
1769,stronger_2017,gyllenhaal has rarely been better  with its swelling score and obligatory shots of noble  fluttering us flags  the film buys into the hero narrative wholesale  it s one of those decent  well acted  non revelatory efforts destined to be filed snarkily under  this had awards buzz  through no real fault of its own  aside from a few mawkish missteps near the tail end  this film feels like the product of a confident  able and self aware director  a deeply human and often brutally honest depiction of trauma and recovery  anchored by three superb performances   though it often falls victim to formula  but the movie shouldn t be dismissed as just another real life drama to catch on cable tv someday  stronger is a profound  sensitively made gem  stronger does a good job of conveying a sense of hope and forgivingness amongst the chaos of senseless violence and for that alone  green and co should be commended  the boldest thing stronger does is trust enough in maslany s performance and in the writing of her character to allow erin to do something that a lesser movie would never even attempt  its interest in personality over symbolism makes  stronger  much better than your average based on an inspirational true story situation  there are few actors in their 30s more well rounded than  jake  gyllenhaal right now  as capable of taking on disturbing psychologies in aggressive indies as they are the lead roles in crowd pleasing tearjerkers  
1770,it_comes_at_night,it comes at night is a powerful  slow burning horror  a distressing and nihilistic examination of human nature that lingers in the mind long after the shocking denouement  shults s adoption of a more vicious mode sharpens his already discomfiting take on families in states of extreme duress in his debut feature krisha  it s a simple exercise in terror that avoids too much explicit violence  and a quietly impressive little movie  shults wants to ask his viewers   how far would you go to protect the people you love   but his work is so clinical and devoid of revelation that it s neither persuasive nor involving  it s a grim vision of a world losing track of objective facts  descending into a poisonous abyss of chaos and disorder  no wonder it strikes such a contemporary chord  the film feels more like an indie art film than a generic shocker  it s not exactly scary but it made me so tense i could hardly breathe  let alone think  the performances are all strong  but how anyone can say this doesn t bolt headlong into all the usual horror clich s  i don t know  a treat to ponder and deconstruct  sombre nocturnes are rarely so entertaining  the film is at its best in querulous  nervy scenes of cabined panic as the unknown lays shadowy siege  in the end  i was left hungry for a payoff that never came  and lamenting that it comes at night s mood and nightmares are not enough to be satisfyingly scary  a fairly straightforward post apocalyptic story  tightly focused on human torment  but suffused with surprising  undeniably atmospheric sights and sounds  
1771,i_called_him_morgan,i couldn t have anticipated that swedish filmmaker kasper collin would provide such a personal and moving portrait of the musician  who died at age 33  you don t have to love jazz to be drawn into this remarkable story 
1772,wind_river_2017,sheridan has professed admiration for clint eastwood s towering anti western  unforgiven  and dark night of the soul dramas from michael mann  both are reference points for his adept mix of masculine posturing and wounded soul searching  
1773,darkest_hour_2017,the script has been written with the caps lock on and joe wright directs accordingly  oldman delivers the greatest hit speeches not just with mastery of cadence but with enough raw power to make the exceedingly familiar sound fresh  director joe  atonement  wright exhibits his trademark flashes of visual aplomb and captures the peril of nazi invasion with thrilling immediacy  despite being almost entirely confined to the claustrophobic corridors of power  who wouldn t want to see the nazis taken to task by george smiley  count dracula and jean baptiste emanuel zorg  this isn t an uncritical celebration of british bulldog spirit but a nuanced portrait of churchill at a key point early in the war  taking us from chamberlain s resignation to the aftermath of dunkirk  the film resists no opportunity to indulge in clunking exposition  it s an amazing performance  the only star turn i ve seen in which a famous actor visible in nearly every scene would be unrecognisable if we didn t know his name already  oldman is sheer joy in a role which transcends an otherwise uneven affair  darkest hour may be brash  but it s never less than riveting when actors such as these are doing their stuff  and yet for all that telling about how it was  the film feels much more like happy fantasy than detailed history  a fond look back on the lead up to a moment of moral righteousness  
1774,battle_of_the_sexes,at 121 minutes  battle of the sexes occasionally drags  but it s the hairy legged feminist male chauvinist pig showdown that we needed right now  a light  funny  blissfully entertaining flick about heavy  sadly still relevant themes  this dramatisation revisits those carnivalesque events in splendidly springy fashion  achieving the quadruple grand slam feat of being emotionally engaging  politically intriguing  dramatically gripping and frequently very funny  stone gives her best performance since she first exploded as a fully formed generational talent in 2010 s easy a  watching male chauvinism get a drubbing will never not be good cinematic sport  and battle of the sexes gives us ringside seats  in a performance tinged with comedy and pathos  carrell captures riggs s sleaziness  his chutzpah and his childlike quality  meanwhile  the triple threat of sarah silverman  alan cumming and elisabeth shue all rolled up in one film is a joy almost too great to bear  finally  a tennis movie that works  after the disappointing borg vs mcenroe  we get another high profile tennis film about a clash of personalities  only this one is defined by thrills  heartache  politics and passion  faris and dayton are interested in how the players got there  not in the game itself  and their emphasis on the whole environment of the match creates a far richer and chewier film than the usual triumphant sports drama  the story of a remarkable woman and her remarkable accomplishments suffers  as too many lgbtq themed twenty first century docudramas do  from an accretion of it gets better telegraphing  despite being aware of the outcome i caught myself quite literally cheering when emma stone s king got a point off steve carell s riggs during the big showdown  
1775,trophy_2017,schwarz and clusiau also come across as glib storytellers  cutting impatiently between several different stories and presenting them in bite size chunks  as in a tv news broadcast  
1776,american_made_2017,but by the time the movie roared to its shockingly grim  remarkably embittered ending  american made had won me over  one assumes that cruise got this film made  yet he s a terrible fit for the role  he s always done his best work portraying smart  insightful characters in dramatic stories  but seal was a yahoo whose sorry escapades are played here for cynical laughs  american made gives director doug liman and charismatic star tom cruise a superior vehicle and plays to their strengths  it s a solid piece of entertainment that takes a stranger than fiction story and brings it to life in convincing fashion  if it isn t always as focused or as deep as i wanted it to be  that does not make the finished feature any less invigorating  this romp into arrogant american excess a tragic flight of fancy well worth taking  there s an aspirational pleasure in seeing cruise  now in his mid 50s  jump through these hoops  he knows we prefer him when he shades his easy charm with self doubt  and barry has a pleasingly sweaty desperation  but not enough     stylish  politically savvy  exceptionally well constructed  if american made were limited to what seal knew personally  some of the dangling threads in gary spinelli s script could be written off  as it is  they hint at stories we d like to know better american made delivers so much as rambunctious entertainment that it s easy to miss the film s withering assessment of american foreign policy during the reagan years  it s everything you could want from a flashy true crime biopic skewering the hypocrisy and malice of the reagan administration s covert war in central and south america  
1777,20th_century_women,mills is clearly fond of all these characters  and is happy to dwell on their moments of happiness and sadness  all of which provide knowledge and worldly wisdom to the teenage boy whose life they will so profoundly affect  we finally have a good film that explores what it looks like to raise a male feminist  particularly during this crucial era  more importantly  we finally have a film that actually cares to do so  shout out to writer director mike mills   too often  one yearns for the simple organising principles of three act structure and boring linear storytelling  exasperatingly supercilious and smug   unfocused  self consciously cute  nostalgic and empathetic  but never properly funny  it feels like someone else s long therapy session  20th century women  deeply charming though it is  takes its cues from dorothea s parenting  it may seem all loosey goosey but there s a dictatorial streak underneath  as there is in so much us filmmaking  indie or otherwise  eras and generations mingle productively in this film  it s a social historical mural that exists in flexitime  where america the beautiful is an eternal and unassailable dream  you won t see any other film this year that tries as hard to get under the skin of its characters as mike mills  20th century women  that s both its glory and what makes it sometimes such a trial  an insightful and  on occasion  laugh out loud piece of filmmaking  artfully shot and structured  while its warmth and wit shine as brightly as the californian sun  brilliantly acted  lovingly shot by sean porter and seamlessly edited by leslie jones  mills shows that the near virtuoso brilliance of beginners was hardly a fluke  the film is well worth a look  if just for the performances  just know going in that director mills calls upon his cast and script to do most of the heavy lifting  
1778,the_womens_balcony,a close knit congregation fractures along gender lines after a catastrophe at their synagogue in this nicely observed dramedy  
1779,a_monster_calls,it s a small  almost delicate film that will richly reward those who connect with it  the movie delivers its meaning repeatedly to make sure that no one misses the point  its lessons  rendered even more explicitly than the ones in conor s classroom  are missing only the chalkboard and pointer  as the movie rumbled toward its inevitably devastating conclusion  the chief emotion i felt wasn t sadness but annoyance at the dashed grander potential  the movie is an emotionally cathartic marvel i was continually captivated by  its final moments as genuine as its title character is pretend  the overall spell it ultimately casts unforgettably pure  director j a  bayona presents appealing worlds  real and imagined  awash in color and detail  but while his movie and its monster are very interested in exploring and explaining humanity  they don t quite get people  the latest young adult novel turned film  a monster calls  approaches its narrative of grief and loss with equal parts nuance and ferocity  plus some beautiful animation  too mature to lure in the younger set and too one dimensional to make much of an impression on adult audiences  rich in folkloric symbolism  this fantasy from director j a  bayona starts promisingly but eventually sinks under a wave of pop psychology  
1780,the_survivalist_2017,you ll leave completely rapt  
1781,okja,it will be a forgiving audience indeed that doesn t recoil from this approach  which is too much stick and not enough carrot  
1782,their_finest_2017,it feels inappropriate to be moved by a film about propaganda during an era of  alternative facts   yet i found my soul soothed by their finest  arterton is excellent  her chemistry with claflin absolute perfection  the two actors disappearing into their respective roles  arterton brings a grace and dignity to the role  which suggests reserves of courage in her character that the screenplay only hints at  stories to inspire a nation have long made up a sizable percentage of hollywood schlock  and their finest deserves credit for exploring a woman s role in such an effort  in its modest  largely comic way  it paints an unusually convincing picture of how films are shaped by factors beyond the control of any one individual  there s the inevitable love triangle as catrin is torn between ellis and tom  but much of the film professes to depict how a film like this would be made in 1940  and it s here that their finest falls short  it s the kind of handsome  rousing  rigorous entertainment you can t help but play along with  drenched in a sweet nostalgia that only very rarely tips into sentimentality  grows into something special  powered forward by arterton s charming central turn  a true breath of fresh which will devastate as well as delight  
1783,citizen_jane_battle_for_the_city,like his previous film  valentino  the last emperor  about the famous fashion designer  director matt tyrnauer takes on a fascinating subject yet mostly consolidates existing information without adding much to our knowledge base  a timely warning against big block buildings with empty ground floor shop units  nonetheless  she was also one tough cookie who appreciated a good fight  a bit more internal tussle would have both better honored her spirit and made for a better documentary  
1784,frantz,the perhaps too beautifully manicured black and white  scope cinematography and paula beer s bravura turn as the german girl who got left behind make it worth your while  
1785,the_lost_city_of_z,they don t make them like this any more  writer director james gray stages all this with an impressive sense of narrative scale  
1786,lady_macbeth,at one hour and 30 minutes  every aspect of the film feels spare and graceful  director william oldroyd delivers a taut and well paced period drama elevated by pugh s riveting performance  each scene is shot with intensity and precision by cinematographer ari wegner  and the dynamic editing helps to build tension in this dank environment  a fascinating portrait of empowerment gone awry  lady macbeth is an acquired taste  but once you get it there s no denying you want more  it is so calculated that you can see every shock from 3 miles out  and if it weren t for cold cruelty  lady macbeth would have no life at all  it s smart about evil  especially about the way it tends to radiate  a corrosive  intelligent costume drama from first time director william oldroyd  oldroyd never allows us to look away from the horror  focusing  in long  intense shots  on the faces of his characters as they suffer  the endless scenes of women being barked at  beaten  and dehumanized make this an unlikely date movie  but they lay the ground for a mighty revenge that earns the heroine her shakespearean nickname  
1787,the_other_side_of_hope,one couldn t help but think of the obvious  heavy handed messaging we d be spared if all directors followed kaurismki s expert smuggling techniques  
1788,princess_cyd,what might have devolved into cutesy odd couple territory instead moves in unexpected directions  bolstered by a fundamental idealism  
1789,land_of_mine,denmark s so called biggest war crime forms the historical backdrop of this nerve jangling bomb disposal drama it s a harrowing story neatly shaped into melodrama by danish writer director martin zandvliet  ham fisted though the drama might be  this 2015 danish german production will almost certainly keep you awake  not least because every few scenes some poor kid is getting blown to bits through fear  incaution  or plain bad luck  
1790,gook,in rooftop conversations  an impressionistic dance sequence that takes place in a parking lot and a devastating conclusion that teeters on the edge of melodrama  chon finds a tone all of his own  the racial discussions happening throughout are far from simplistic or rudimentary  this fearless multidimensionality giving chon s script an impressive edge that s invigorating   john  chon shows a definite talent for drawing out strong performances from his actors  as well as marshaling expressive imagery that s enhanced by roger suen s lyrical music score  justin chon looks at bigotry through the eyes of two korean brothers in l a  s south central in 1992  the result is hardass yet hypnotically beautiful  the film isn t perfect   mr  chon s wild camera motions seem more undisciplined than electric   but it does find an angle on the riots that hasn t been seen much onscreen  yes  it s uneven  but viewers who can forgive some of its shortcomings will be rewarded  and look forward to whatever chon may come up with next  raw and compelling from its poetic opening shot to its gut punch finale  gook doesn t always find the best way to express itself  but it knows what needs to be said  chon directs with style and a humane eye for all parties  he s a dynamic young director to keep your eye on  chon s drama is uneven but bristling with life  and it offers a new perspective on a calamitous moment  one whose 25th anniversary has been commemorated in recent months with a slew of potent documentaries  we ll definitely be seeing more from actor director chon in the future  nodding to spike lee s do the right thing and kevin smith s clerks  this sophomore feature exemplifies the grunge and angst ridden energy of the 90s  with a humorous streak as frank as its racially charged title  
1791,human_flow,beautifully filmed testimonies that tear at your soul  
1792,abacus_small_enough_to_jail,disarmingly human moments   the sung daughters  all high powered lawyers  fret over their 80 year old father s disappointing sandwich   pepper this compelling courtroom drama  
1793,school_life,boarding school  especially for these youngsters  aged eight to 12  has rarely looked more appealing  file this charming documentary alongside  tre et avoir in the list of films that make the case that teachers are the closest thing we have to superheroes in everyday life  there are some lovely observations from the directors neasa ni chian in and david rane  especially the scenes of music lessons  imagine fred wiseman directing a remake of school of rock but in ireland and you re almost there  but with more incidental music and a closer focus on the charming characters  a rambunctious collage of a self contained self sustaining world  with its own rules of play and concerns  while headfort may offer an aspirational model for schools  such pervasive niceness can come across as repetitive on screen     it s the kind of school that could never exist in today s america  it s too freewheeling  too unstructured  maybe it won t exist in ireland much longer either  so it s a good thing that school life manages to capture its weird  wonderful world  ostensibly documenting a year in the life of headfort school    the spanish co production instead quickly reveals itself as an irresistibly admiring portrait of long married couple john and amanda leyden  both staff members for over 40 years   the film  thrives whenever it regards headfort as a place suspended between an ancient institution and an overgrown home  one that fosters both the transient children and the adults who have become part of the furniture  
1794,all_this_panic, filmmakers jenny gage and tom betterton  got close to them as brooklyn neighbors and spent three years following them as they matured and began to separate from parents and forge their own identities  gage makes each minute boldly and deeply matter  there s no judgment to be found here  only an unvarnished look at its subjects struggling to figure out who they are  what they want  and how they might achieve their goals  gage s singular  gendered focus is refreshing  simply offering these young women a platform in which to articulate their immature but still perceptive worldview carries some inherent value  a wisp of a thing at 79 minutes  the film punches above its weight when it comes to quietly life changing insights into the tricky business of growing up  affirms what we have suspected  fun in the social networking age   web one upmanship  wars of esteem and self esteem   has become fraught  even neurotic  compelling material that never quite comes of age  more remarkable for the way it looks than the actual  somewhat banal  girl talk content  it s a marvelous  absorbing film  with truth vibrating through frame after frame  
1795,silence_2017,while it is certainly more like an endurance race than a stroll through the park  there is something redeeming in its cinematic beauty  scorsese doesn t glorify martyrdom  and he doesn t even hate the killers  he makes death as blunt and dull and useless as a snapped pencil  the point is that there is no point  alternately powerful and somnolent  not all so called passion projects are able to convey actual passion on screen  this one does  silence feels like both an ardent reaffirmation of faith and a lonely cry out to god in the dark  silence is scorsese s most expansive historical canvas  but in the tightness with which it plots these torturing relationships that might lead to enlightenment it is his most hermetic  secretively enclosed  scorsese s abiding passion and respect for his source material are everywhere in evidence  for once  perhaps  they are a little too great  silence is a troubling  emotion fueled enigma  and only through additional viewings do i believe an understanding of what it is scorsese is attempting to say will ever be determined   silence  feels like a career summation for a filmmaker who has spent his life exploring his faith through his work  here is a movie about the importance of religion that will move you  regardless of whichever god you worship   or don t  this is a long and dull costume drama that seems to think a contemporary audience can picture faith as easily as it does a cassock  cross or kimono  the movie eventually achieves a level of powerful drama   but only after dithering for more than an hour  the actors are steeped in the drama and mysticism of the moment  especially garfield s stoic rodrigues  who emerges as the central figure and also narrator of this journey into the unknown  both the physical and metaphysical  the film can be ponderous in its rumination and ambiguity  but few cinematic treatments of christianity and sanctity have been as generous or as intellectually challenging as silence  silence is martin scorsese s film about jesuit priests in 17th century japan whose faith is sorely tested  just as your patience will be sorely tested too  
1796,maudie,both writer and director set out in search of a heroine  they re so intent on crafting a legend  they leave out the uncomfortable bits  they do her and us a disservice in that respect  maudie is a sad film about poor people  but it could scarcely be more open to benevolence and quiet humanism  walsh s film feels jarringly at odds with contemporary sensibilities  a bully is a bully  no matter how cheerfully he is painted  a difficult and highly mannered performance from sally hawkins coupled with a repugnant and profoundly unappealing character played by ethan hawke sink this curious  and curiously saccharine  biopic   maudie  fulfils all our narrative expectations and you ll almost certainly exit the cinema happy  so long as you can leave it there  the only fireworks here are of the indoor kind  but this sensitive  beautifully acted film lingers long after the final frame  and the newfoundland locations are breathtaking  maud lewis left the world a brighter place than she found it  this drably earnest rendering of her life story doesn t follow suit  aisling walsh knows how to balance the comedy and the pathos as she takes us through her subject s life and chronicles her unlikely emergence as an artist  an oddly affecting love story about burying the hurt and trudging forward in the face of pain and finding your own version of happiness  there s much to appreciate in maudie  especially if you re a fan of odd pair love stories  but don t expect to learn much about what drives folk artists to create or what makes a woman pelted by life s lemons squeeze them into lemonade  an unsentimental but emotional film for anyone who suspects in their heart of hearts that suffering really is the only thing that makes anyone worth a damn  walsh shapes hawkins and hawke s interplay so that the film registers as a bizarre couple love story    these actors conjure a deep nonverbal bond that defies explanation  the story offers many opportunities for glibness and sentimentality  walsh falls for none of them  
1797,endless_poetry,this bullishly played saga has enough quirky detail  audacious incident and visual panache to sweep the storyline through its less persuasive phases  
1798,detroit_2017,it s not an easy film to watch but bigelow s control over every aspect ensures it s utterly convincing  what might be most characteristic of bigelow is the eerie feeling that the police are halfway  acting out   performing their brutality  it s an admirably worthy project  but not nearly as worthy of your time as it ought to be  detroit becomes a kind of neo gothic horror story  detroit comes out of its corner slugging and barely stops  by the end the viewer has a swollen eye  ringing ears and a conviction that the referee should have stopped the fight  each actor inhabits their role with a precision and mettle that means even in the depths of confusion  the complex group dynamics are easy to read  fascinating but deeply flawed  i don t hate detroit  i simply can t recommend it  
1799,obit,as someone who takes great pleasure in both reading and writing valedictions to the recently deceased  i can personally attest that the movie s dead on  these folks are neither dour nor sappy  they are just talented journalists who want to do right by the people who left their mark on the world  vanessa gould s brisk  affectionate documentary obit suggests that obituary writing as practiced by the ace team at the new york times could be the most imaginative and organic form of journalism in contemporary newspapers  a fascinating look at the way in which these memorials function as not only tributes to fascinating  influential  idiosyncratic lives  but also as crucial records about our society and culture  it is abundantly clear that obit was made by someone who  to paraphrase featured obituarist bruce weber  has encountered death before and knows how to approach the subject with compassion  readers of the new york times are bound to enjoy an inside look at one of the paper s most dependably enthralling sections  entertaining if a bit conventional in its anecdotal structure and slightly cutesy tone  these 95 minutes should appeal to the same public that happily spends half the day reading the sunday times     the film ascribes to a conventionally contrapuntal take on the lives of those who spend all day surrounded by death  gould secures plenty of nuts and bolts detail about the reporting and writing process  which can range from novelistic use of detail to the prosaic but no less critical matter of confirming the death itself  
1800,black_panther_2018,you could feel like everybody felt like they were making something that they were really proud of  
1801,mission_impossible_fallout,i stayed to the final credit  in case there was a clever tag  but i didn t feel cheated when there wasn t one  i needed the time to catch my breath  mcquarrie cleverly controls the ticking clock quality that makes these films so much fun  
1802,blackkklansman,what i especially love is how the movie refuses to offer up any pat or easy answers  blackkklansman slips seamlessly from borderline absurdist humour to all too real horror  conjuring an urgent blend of sociopolitical period satire and contemporary wake up call  blackkklansman blends comic irony and outspoken polemic but still works very effectively as a hardboiled crime drama  
1803,spider_man_into_the_spider_verse,actually captures the sensation of getting absorbed in a comic book  a great story from top to bottom   this film manages the delicate feat of embracing its source material while also satirizing it   this juxtaposition of old fashioned graphics and modern cgi effects is quite effective in bringing together the almost real and the animated  the latest entry in a fully saturated genre that somehow  through sheer creative gumption  does something new  it easily ranks among the more enjoyable superhero releases in recent memory and that s in large part thanks to the charming young man at its center  the spectacularly colorful  varied  and busy animation is impressive but bombastic  leaving little room for wonder and suggesting exertion rather than inspiration  yet with great power comes great responsibility  and one such responsibility  as a critic  is to admit when you ve made a mistake  the scale feels vast  yet the spirit is joyous  it s as if everyone had set out to make the best spider man movie ever  which is exactly what they ve done  an all around terrific new animated film that perhaps more than any superhero movie i ve seen translates the jubilant experience of comic books to the screen  
1804,a_star_is_born_2018,pop singer lady gaga is quite good as the wife    she subtly and convincingly manages the character s transformation from vulnerable ingenue to self confident celebrity  what really works about this version is the fact that bradley cooper co wrote it  he produced it and stars in it  and put it together but he incorporates little elements of lady gaga s story  a star is born foregrounds all of the ways jackson and ally are enamored with each other  the intimacy that enhanced their bond and the affection that inspired their songs  a star is born doesn t push any cinematic boundaries  it isn t edgy or provocative  but it s emotionally rich and hugely satisfying  some of the best performances of the year   cooper is going to be a great director if he can continue this kind of filmmaking momentum  if you re able to forget the stars that have gone before  a star is born is a very professional tear jerker with some very loud music  and for many that will be enough  co written by cooper  who also helped write some of the film s music  the script doesn t exactly bubble with wit but it doesn t have to  what matters is that it gives both leads the chance to charm one another   and us  at its huge  pulsating heart this is a story about lovers desperately trying to save one another   from the loss of integrity in an industry that disdains it and from self destructive impulses with roots too old and deep to be touched  the problem is whenever cooper turns the film away from his best asset  gaga  and into a vanity production  bradley cooper s 2018 rendition of a star is born manages the impossible  bringing this seemingly old fashioned story about fame into the present while retaining its classical  timeless appeal  as deep and resonant as bradley cooper s drawl  and as bright as lady gaga s screen future  
1805,a_quiet_place_2018, john  krasinski never lets up  his directorial hand moving various pieces this way and that as he plays his little cat and mouse most dangerous game with astonishing virtuosity 
1806,eighth_grade,one of the things i think works really well is that they show not only her perspective but her single fathers perspective  
1807,roma_2018,this has plenty to say about class relations too  but what s most impressive about it is how the mexican writer director cinematographer editor transforms even his political observations into the stuff of big screen spectacle  narratively  not a lot happens during the opening 60 70 minutes  but cuaron is marinating us so that later events have an uncommonly strong impact  
1808,can_you_ever_forgive_me,this film takes an altogether different view of the imitation game  by embracing frauds and failures  it achieves greatness on the sly  perfectly cast  israel is anti social and aggressive but you do find yourself rooting for her  it doesn t hammer anything home  there is no heavy handed exposition  no back stories  the characters arrive as is  every beat of the film is just so  its portraiture as rich as the characters themselves are barely solvent  we can t believe the two got away with it for so long  but simultaneously we will them on  the screenplay by nicole holofcener and jeff whitty is well structured  witty and poignant  the funniest moments tend to be the most painful or humiliating ones  a poignant and tender caper that doesn t sugar coat its protagonists with redemptive hollywood schmaltz  can you ever forgive me  is a dirty martini of a movie you ll want to savour  mccarthy is very good at showing how lee s unpleasant bad temper and rudeness were not simply part of her psychological makeup  they were symptoms of existential panic  a moving hymn to outsiders  this thrives on two criminally good performances from melissa mccarthy and richard e  grant  it also confirms marielle heller as one of the brightest directorial talents around  heller does do a fine job of showing the physicality of israel s morally dubious work  melissa mccarthy gives a brilliantly calibrated performance that should see her touted on the awards circuit  
1809,the_favourite_2018,it s a dark view  but dark views  like sunny views  have to come from somewhere  where is lanthimos s dark sun  i don t know  but i ll definitely keep watching  yorgos lanthimos  dryly funny historical feature is all about power  and that means literally wearing the pants in a strange time  pushes the idea of the capricious monarch through the far reaches of comedy and almost into tragedy  colman embodies sublimely the punch drunk confusion of a woman unsure whether she s child or adult  plaything or puppet master  weisz and stone are both brilliantly witty and nimble  but colman s performance is nothing short of sublime  it is savagely funny and often preposterous  with duck racing and ludicrous  vertiginous wigs and an astonishingly weird dance scene  yet it is also involving and deeply moving with performances that are monumentally stellar  the favourite gratifyingly proves that lanthimos can put his mordantly idiosyncratic stamp on even the staidest of genres  breaking  olivia colman is our new god  the favourite doesn t offer horrors to compare with lanthimos s the lobster or his the killing of a sacred deer  but the creative misanthropy and orchestral cruelty are every bit as striking  colman  always brilliant  has never seemed more divine  if she s not nominated for an oscar  i will cry  quite simply  an utter and hilarious delight  weird  dirty but accessible  the favourite is a perfectly performed  thrillingly made period picture that morphs before your very eyes  the favourite is so assaultively entertaining that you keep wanting to go outside for fresh air  despite its period setting  the favourite just might be lanthimos s most trenchant and relevant work yet  there are no heroes in the favourite  there are only sad creatures driven by their various needs  there is  however  a morbid morality to the proceedings  one in which decadence is its own punishment  
1810,paddington_2,is anything as improbable as a  feel good  movie that actually leaves us feeling terrific  how about two of them in the same series  the paddington films preach a message of acceptance that s no less straightforward than that of the shape of water  encouraging viewers to share in the hero s tolerant worldview  a dash of wes anderson and a sprinkle of jean pierre jeunet  swirled around with a wonderfully fluid sense of airiness and light  it s mannered  yet carefree  colorful  and evocative  it s a fun movie  within which lurks a poignant idea and  yes  an oversimple one about communities and their outsiders   paddington 2  has one out loud laugh  plenty of sincere cleverness  vast technical ingenuity  a warm heart  lively performances and enough gyroscopic camera moves to make max oph ls jealous  i might even go so far as to proclaim paddington 2 pretty much perfect  but let me indulge in one more marmalade sandwich before i make the decision to say just that  even in a sequel  bond s furry metaphor survives its animation intact  if you have kids  take them  if you have nieces and nephews  take them  if you don t have kids but just want to feel like one yourself  go see it  paddington is a bear for all seasons  utterly beguiling  this bear is constantly striving to earn the approval of the humans in his life  one day  maybe we can all be worthy of his  
1811,leave_no_trace,granik s star making instincts are as sharp as ever  i loved this film  occasionally uplifting and sometimes heartbreaking  it is nothing less than sublime  debra granik directs with a touch that s as gentle on the audience as bees are to tom  there is not a move  cut  sound  or deliberate stretch of silence that in some way doesn t advance and inform the plot  granik s films also convey a strong sense of place  which is aided in large measure by cinematographer michael mcdonough  leave no trace might be described in social terms as a film about homelessness  but it never loses sight of the fact that what makes a home is the privacy people need to connect with each other  with leave no trace  filmmaker debra granik revisits themes of female power years after the flawless winter s bone  this movie filled my heart  and it broke my heart   thomasin mckenzie  is a massive find  there is such wisdom in her presence   you can feel her seeing everything and taking it all in  there s such a naturalism to the way she responds in every single situation  leave no trace is further evidence granik is one of the most talented directors around   and ben foster ranks among the finest and most intense actors working today  it speaks in hushed voices  makes few fast moves and requires the viewer to infer a lot about its characters   and also to fear for their safety  granik is one of the most distinctive filmmaking voices we have  i d love to see her make more features but i m also glad she takes the time to do them right  
1812,incredibles_2,what thrilled me the most     watching these characters do the thing they were born to do  and  fully be themselves instead of repressing something fundamental about themselves  you ll gawp  you ll ponder  you ll laugh  a pixar flick would be nothing without the last  there s a serious movie lurking at the heart of all this hi tech adventure that takes timely swipes at gender inequality  family stress and the modern triumph of salesmanship over substance  the result is hugely entertaining and often visually audacious   yet it doesn t quite pack the emotional wallop of the original  a gorgeously curated scrapbook of sharply observed household comedy  sublimely staged action  a pinch of chuck jones era slapstick  and enough modernist eye candy to induce a sugar coma in design buffs  how great to see them back in this funny  exciting  if less audacious film  the visuals  voiceovers and music are all in perfect sync  brad bird creates an immersive  mesmerising world that you flow into unquestioningly instead of pausing to crib about the sundry plotholes and twists and turns  incredibles 2 regresses to a time when any power women managed to acquire was carefully controlled so as not constitute a threat to the male order  such nostalgia is self defeating  incredibles 2 spins like a pop art pinwheel because  brad  bird boasts a coherent and scintillating vision  he turns an action comedy about superhumans into a jamboree of human possibilities  craig t nelson and holly hunter in particular are on top form  and the laughs are genuine and well earned  i exaggerate not a bit when i say that parents will feel just as empowered while watching  incredibles 2  as any child  it s a nostalgic vision of total power of a local minimum that echoes sickeningly with the nostalgic pathologies of the current day  nowhere more than in win s enthusiastic declaration of his plan to  make superheroes legal again   
1813,call_me_by_your_name,the characters  beauty and intellectual perfection is so consummate that i couldn t entirely believe that these people actually had genitals that they could ever sweat or incur sunburn  you may not realize how strong the acting is until you replay the movie in your head later  
1814,widows_2018,mcqueen sets a relentlessly portentous tone and employs lots of stark mise en scene  but all the fuss feels arbitrary here   the pulpy story simply doesn t warrant such grave stylization  a thriller for modern women who identify more with the messiness of human lives than with flattened slogans about how great women  as a monolithic group  are  a great ensemble cast  steve mcqueen lets loose on some of the formalism we ve seen in some of his other films and  it moves really well  it offers everything adults used to love about cinema  with its themes of political corruption and large scale criminal activity  widows is effortlessly transformed into an american setting  a gritty romp that makes the clich  prone heist genre feel fresh again  a cast this stacked can t help but generate glory  widows is filled with wild beauty  heart thumping grotesquerie and even some good ol  soapy treachery  the movie isn t interested in being about women  or even womanhood  so much as the specific women we watch mature from partners of convenience into true equals  and yet these people aren t a mere substitute for an archetypal male character  davis is superb as veronica  her grief is palpable  her pain is omnipresent  
1815,shoplifters,a film that just grows and grows and grows  it seems very quiet  but you are absolutely hooked  writer director hirokazu kore eda fills the film with grace notes  humor and fine observations  circling and filling out each character while leaning more on innocence than corruption  it s all beautifully done  if seemingly aimless  for most of its two hour runtime  the joy of the movie lies mostly in watching these fine actors build their beautifully flawed and lived in characters  at once charming and heart wrenching  this exquisitely performed film will steal the hearts of both art house and mainstream audiences  shoplifters achieves that ultimate goal of art as expressed by the artist robert filliou  it s art that makes life more interesting than art  there are numerous tender  affecting moments en route to the finale s tearjerker overdrive  many of them productively tangential to the overarching idea of choosing one s own family  a story whose ethical quandaries are presented with equal parts compassion and toughness  every one of master japanese filmmaker hirokazu kore eda s movies breaks your heart in a different way  the movie uses a domestic drama to illustrate larger and more compelling concerns about society in general  
1816,wont_you_be_my_neighbor,this timely doc will resonate deeply with anyone who remembers rogers befriending them from the small screen  
1817,first_man,damien chazelle is an enthusiastic  visually expressive filmmaker with practically nothing of interest to say about the human experience  first man doesn t just dwell on its subject s achievements  it takes a beat to glance into armstrong s personal motivations and vulnerabilities while using technical mastery to tell an engrossing true life story  a fascinating film  it s difficult to watch at times because there s so much loss and so much risk that we never really thought about that lead us getting there  while gosling plays everything close to his chest  it s foy who invites us into the unfolding drama with her wonderfully empathetic performance  it has amazing performances  and it s technically very well presented  unfortunately  i felt very detached from neil armstrong  from start to finish the moon landing segment is arguably the most sensational bit of filmmaking i ve had the pleasure of witnessing in all of 2018  it s a movie where the technique matches the ambition  one that moves from tragedy to grandeur to personal drama without becoming bombastic or even worse  falsely patriotic  ryan gosling s impassive visage must have the gravitational pull of a black hole  because chazelle can t seem to keep his camera from being pulled loose from its moorings and drawn in thisclose for more than one or two scenes at a time  first manis one of this year s must see movies  a quietly profound drama that pays tribute to one of america s all time greatest achievements  what the movie does do is give you a hair raising feeling of what it really felt like inside the space craft  where every hour was life threatening and the outcome was always perilous  
1818,crazy_rich_asians,feels blithely liberated from the obligation to offer up suffering that has long been part of the implicit bargain made with so many mainstream movies focused on characters of color that they are treated as marketable in relation to the pain they portray 
1819,i_tonya,how much harding knew or didn t know about the attack on kerrigan is somewhat secondary  if that can be believed  gillespie has imbued his film with black humour  while never undermining the authenticity of the characters or detracting from the abuse that runs through the story  craig gillespie directs with all the subtlety of a baton wielding thug but has made at least one brilliant decision in casting margot robbie  who is practically a machine for generating empathy  whatever your views on the us in general and harding in particular  you ll leave this cheering for margot robbie  bravo  it leaves a sense of several stronger movies half buried beneath a mish mash of the poignantly heart rending and the outlandishly farcical  and just about salvaged from mediocrity by its one sensational turn  a furiously engaging movie that features margot robbie in an ice rink  margot robbie at the action end of brutalising domestic abuse and  most significantly  margot robbie transforming fourth wall breaking into a nearly sublime art form  one of those rare films that gets better as it continues  compellingly stumped by its own heroine  the film simply can t make its mind up about tonya harding  if it did  it wouldn t get away with being such a blast  what does emerge from every account is that tonya harding was a force of nature  single minded  very tough and always ready to keep on fighting  even if she had the fatalistic view that people from her background simply weren t allowed to become winners  robbie and janney are flawless in a compelling and corrective account of a misunderstood figure  one of the more darkly funny biopics you ll ever see  gillespie s flippant biopic leans too heavily into lightness  not only does it remain oddly silent on kerrigan  but it feels flippant about domestic abuse      robbie  transforms what could easily have been just another grotesquerie in a grand guignol into a fully rounded  albeit unsympathetic  character  
1820,the_hate_u_give,a bold and galvanic central turn and a ridiculously ambitious political agenda push this moving teenage melodrama far beyond the parameters of its own wonky sales pitch  
1821,phantom_thread,anderson has trouble coaxing this struggle to any sort of emotional climax  its fanciful  symbolic ending is the sort critics will praise for its careful ambiguity even as they overlook its narrative desperation  i ve seen phantom thread three times now  and each time i have been gripped ever tighter in its sublimely eerie and immaculately constructed web  
1822,sorry_to_bother_you_2018,pinballing frenetically between amusement  absurdity and anger  this is an unruly piece which takes pointed pot shots at coercive capitalism before galloping toward an impressively unhinged third act  
1823,avengers_infinity_war,infinity war didn t wear me down in the way that age of ultron did  it didn t give me the high of the first avengers either  like i said  manage expectations and you ll be just fine  the film s risk comes from the inherent need to  balance  a myriad of characters  storylines  yet the story itself is nothing more than those same mcu building blocks  the conclusion of infinity war is so shocking because it doesn t feel like a cliffhanger  more like a drastic wiping clean of the slate before the whole cycle starts again  with whatever reversal of fortune or comprehensive reboot it may be  this chaotic but surprisingly nimble instalment  directed by anthony and joe russo  brings together an eye popping ensemble cast of a listers  imagine the table read   and pushes them into playful new configurations  this blockbuster leaves you wildly curious about the sequel  even if you are not an avengers fanatic  some of the sequences are undeniably thrilling but  at about 2 1 2 hours  overkill sets in early   avengers  infinity war  isn t just a gussied up mediocrity being widely mistaken for a good movie  it s also  at least arguably  a dangerous movie for anyone who cares about the future of american cinema  given that the plot motor is thanos s worry that the universe is overpopulated  sly self awareness is shown as the filmmakers embrace drastic solutions to the problems of braiding multiple franchises into one  all i know is that marvel has lived up to its reputation for daring its filmmakers to break boundaries  and trusting its audience to go along for the ride  i don t think fans will be disappointed  because so much is purposefully unresolved and so little is actually decided  i just can t say i enjoyed watching infinity war all that much  
1824,ant_man_and_the_wasp,paul rudd s ability to keep ex con single dad reluctant superhero scott lang simultaneously sceptical  confused and committed to the sci fi chaos around him without ever going boringly square jawed is nothing less than the purest movie star charisma  
1825,isle_of_dogs_2018,another utterly distinctive  formally brilliant exercise in savant innocence from anderson  somewhere between arch naivety and inspired sophistication  maybe i m just a cat person  
1826,hereditary,gradually downshifts into generic cliche  abandoning well mapped psychogeography for psychokinetic silliness and superfluous plot exposition  
1827,the_post,the tensions wind up deliciously as we work our way to a penultimate celebration of a now imperilled medium  
1828,the_death_of_stalin,a devastatingly funny dissection of power politics  stripping the mystique from it and those who worship it  iannucci has done it again  the death of stalin is signature iannucci   absurd set ups leading to even more outrageous ends via the spitefully delicious cadence of his dialogue  while much of this is certainly hilarious  there are also scenes that drag  director and co writer armando iannucci puts it all on black  comedy   betting that the vast discrepancy between great power and small souls will make you laugh at the absurdity of it all   or at least not scream in horror   the death of stalin  should please moviegoers who appreciate humor that s significantly more sophisticated than we ve become accustomed to encountering on the big screen these days  iannucci did not intend the death of stalin to be a direct commentary on the trump presidency  and it should not be taken as one  but as they say  first time tragedy  second time farce  from start to finish  director co writer armando iannucci  creator of hbo s brilliant veep  delivers an audacious and insightful and ridiculous and hilarious send up that reminded me of the classic monty python films of the 1970s and 1980s  there s a universality to the humor that will reach even those with only a vague knowledge of who stalin was  this is satirical history that invites prophecy   imagine a future trump administration version  iannucci may have turned nury s somber novel into something of a goof  but he also takes a more complex view of beria   death of stalin is a priceless political satir but what s really impressive is how hard it tries to fit beria s story into the puzzle  if it s a romp  then it s a romp that does what anything on this topic must do  leave audiences a little rattled  with a hint of ashes in the mouth  vladimir putin s ministry of culture ministry has banned  the death of stalin  from being shown in russia  there can be no greater praise  
1829,minding_the_gap,though it runs just 93 minutes  this cinema verite documentary by bing liu manages to feel like an epic  it will warm your heart but possibly break it a little too  this is a movie about what people are prepared to swallow when they re thirsty for love  liu documents his friends  fitful steps towards adulthood  he explores the way that violence can write itself into the dna of a community  recurring in subsequent generations  powerful  very insightful because it s so intimate  the ruthless manner in which he has hacked a decade s worth of footage into 93 taut minutes alone qualified him for oscar consideration  each boy is likeable  troubled  searching  and hypnotically watchable in the way he puts his features on record  dimly conscious that his feelings are playing those features like a needle on a disc  it soon becomes apparent that all three of them are struggling to become adults while dealing with the legacies of childhoods devastated by family violence  minding the gap becomes less a story about the ad hoc fraternity of skateboarders and more about the fractured home life that sends them looking for a surrogate family  the score by nathan halpern and chris ruggiero is sparse and beautiful and perfect  the editing is brilliant  
1830,three_identical_strangers,dramatises the nature vs nurture argument in a murky and intriguing way  if only its stylistic mannerisms didn t threaten to obscure the storytelling  
1831,the_rider,an extraordinary translation of life into art  the rider reshapes the traditional cowboy narrative in a way that both embraces and challenges western tropes  a hugely impressive slice of prairie naturalism  working with non professional actors from the pine ridge community  zhao tells the fictionalised true story of bareback bronc rider brady blackburn  jandreau proves a charismatic draw  even if some of the supporting non actors struggle with naturalistic performances  the rider could easily have been pitying or patronising but it is suffused instead with warmth  understanding and insightful detail not fiction  not documentary  instead  a story standing under a chimerical moon while fate  laconic and inarticulate like its victims  growls from far off  there is minimalistic elegance to this film that couldn t help but blow me away  brady  rarely raising his voice above a murmur  takes us on an emotional journey  figuring out his own way forward  the plains go on forever  so  we hope  does hope  jandreau  acting opposite his real life family members and friends  disappears into a role largely based on his own experiences  oozing empathy from his pores  it s just plain excellent  you will want to be there  pulling for brady  no matter what choices he makes  more importantly  you will care about those choices  and about him  
1832,the_old_man_and_the_gun,this is a career capping showcase for redford  who with subtlety and ease goes out in style after a great long run  the great thing about this film is we get to focus on his face and we get to remember all of his moments   a  meditative and thought provoking look at mortality  commitment and people s penchant for chasing something they might never catch  the truth is  you can afford to miss lowery s portrait of the  con  artist as an old man  paradoxically  if you see it  you won t feel your time has been wasted  david lowery s film has the grace to treat its elder characters with respect  it does that by treating them like human beings   redford s  scenes with spacek in particular are beautifully played and have just enough bite and irony to avoid slipping into mushy nostalgia  essentially a love letter to redford s own screen career  it helps if you share his twinkle eyed nostalgia for roguish criminals  a delightful folk story from one of the best filmmakers working today   and a fitting final turn from redford  all easy charm and grace  it takes a lifetime of effort to look this effortless  loose limbed  rascally and texan to its bones  the old man   the gun is a throwback to an era when making beautifully understated crime comedies was the peak of hollywood s ambition  before all the spandex took over   there s nothing here that s going to vex or perplex you  and you ll walk out of the cinema happy and satisfied  a real crowd pleaser  
1833,mcqueen,this is a visually powerful  emotionally draining documentary  what keeps mcqueen from being a brilliant doco is its willingness to skim over the darkest parts of the designer s life   the directors  would have done well to shear away the obscuring frills of polite encomiums and pay more attention to the structural details of both the man and what he made  utilizing michael nyman s    magnificent score with pinpoint precision  the filmmakers infuse their film with an urgent vibrancy that s positively transfixing  mcqueen is a haunting biography that goes beyond even that live runway experience to conjure the visionary himself  in as much as he may ever be known   and in a way even his savagely beautiful clothes themselves cannot  if you have any intention of seeing  mcqueen  make sure you see it in a theater for full effect   mcqueen  makes the case that its subject was an artist whose clay was clothing  it also  despite giving short shrift to psychoanalysis  reminds us that everything you might want to know about the artist can be found in the art  mcqueen sates audiences  desires to hear about the man s origins  the mania that fueled his creations  and his ultimate downward spiral  but it only ever feels like a pattern waiting to be sewn together  those closest to  mcqueen  seem content to make peace with the dueling spirits inside him  even if he could not  the film s methods are familiar  but accordingly satisfying  formally traditional  and guided by a respectful approach to a complicated man  it s lovingly told  even as it refuses to gloss over ugliness  
1834,summer_1993,a deeply personal child s eye view of loss  summer 1993 is an utterly beguiling debut feature from spanish writer director carla sim n  the film doesn t detour or disturb  doesn t serpentine or surprise  as great cinema can  it just puts everything on the thematic picnic plate and tells us to get eating  impeccably performed by its young leads and nurturing supporting cast  this deeply personal picture particularly impresses in the closing scenes  which are quietly devastating in their intimacy  insight and truth  a slow moving summer  but one worth seeing through  not since boyhood has a film shown this much respect and understanding for what it s like to be a child  essential to the film s success is the authenticity of the two young girls  both are amazing naturals  most of the time behaving as if they are totally unaware that there is a camera present  some creatures are able to grow new limbs  frida  given more than half a chance after demanding it  achieves something no less remarkable  she grows new joy and hope  movingly understated and beautifully acted  rather than adopt an excuse to turn this hardship material into easy sentiment  sim n treats this very personal matter with a focused  unhurried wisdom for the ways even a left turn girlhood can still be a celebration of being young  alive  and open  
1835,a_fantastic_woman,when the screen went dark prior to running the final credits  i assumed for an instant that some small initial section had come to a close  in fact  an hour and three quarters had gone by  
1836,first_reformed,they are weird moments of almost hypnotic transcendence  but at the center of it is that tortured god s lonely man character perfectly embodied by ethan hawke  a work that most 30 year old s would welcome  and one that a 71 year old might have thought would never come around again  you won t see a more textured film this summer  schrader is the divine mortal who wrote taxi driver and raging bull  he s as passionate as ever  what he has lost is his discipline  this is a film that wrestles with its themes through rigorously crafted dialogue  schrader sees no benefit in underlining those words with showy camerawork or score  the film making equivalent of going through the script with a neon highlighter pen  but it is  at least  powerfully puzzling and grippingly puzzling  you may not understand it  completely   but you will come away with the feeling that something was being said  whatever that something may have been  yet ultimately it s so good  and the attention to truthfulness so intense  that schrader writes himself into a narrative dead end and to a conclusion that bounces  within a few short minutes  from shocking to preposterous to silly to schmaltzy  shaker furniture in movie form   stark  plain  conceived in austere and intelligent good taste  beautifully made  in fact  but maybe more designed for looking at than actually sitting on  an unforgettable powerhouse  ultimately its sheer archness reveals paul schrader as a gifted and deeply persuasive evangelist of the transcendental style   if not quite a canon saint   first reformed  takes some wild  unexpected and uncomfortable turns in its final act that will surely shock some  anger others and disturb just about everyone  for schrader  it shows that he s still got it  welcome back  first reformed deserves all praise  
1837,free_solo,the visuals are stunning  offering head spinning views with the comfort of total safety  a visually dizzying but also thought provoking film about one man s pinnacle of achievement  i just got so swept up in it all  i love hearing what others are so passionate about  completely taken by alex s story  there is something epic and disturbing about honnold s singularity  his desire to be the one person on the planet who can do something that no one else can  it s worth seeing on the biggest screen you can find  is it strange when the wholehearted pursuit of a singular and spectacular achievement inspires pity and fear more than awe  the vast  sublime shots of honnold framed by trees and valleys far  far below  are simply magic  terrifying  but magic  a geological love letter to manspreading  free solo is about getting dangerously close to the edge  where some people feel most alive  we get to experience that thrill secondhand  and that s enough  this plays out with as much  or more  suspense than any conventional thriller as the cameras capture every step of alex s ascent  
1838,burning_2018,lee hypnotises with his story of a love triangle  crafting a movie that could be described as visual poetry  this is the kind of film that all but demands a second viewing in order to appreciate the complex elegance of the design  assembled from details systematically calculated to lend themselves to more than one interpretation  burning casts such a strange spell  a twisted love triangle at the core of this korean thriller   becomes something far more unsettling thanks to a bracing midway plot jolt and a powerful atmosphere of doom and dread created by the director lee chang dong  burning is primarily about the novelistic imagination  but jongsu s story also coalesces the mood of uncertainty that has been visible in the korean left during the ultra rightwing presidencies of lee myungbak and park geunhye  so much ambiguous detail to ponder  while the visual design insidiously marks your memory  slow and difficult to get a hold on  burning emerges as a brilliantly made one off  puzzling  intelligent and ultimately mesmerising  and jong seo jun is a revelation  the film paints vivid portraits of three distinct characters and inspires sympathy with a bewildered protagonist  moreover  it depicts a particular social milieu in such a way that one comes to see it as existing beyond the subjects  control  this absorbing  if fitfully frustrating  portrait of love  obsession and jealousy is rarely less than fascinating  it s also a fine showcase for steven yeun   the walking dead    who proves he s much more than a happy meal for zombies  the kind of movie whose takeaways you could spend hours debating and still feel miles away from being sure of anything at all  a melancholy look at how we imagine ourselves in the world  and all the ways that class  family and desire can come to complicate that  burning is an intriguing dramatic mystery that rarely bequeaths answers  usurping the male gaze and dichotomy between the well meaning creep and madman  
1839,searching_2018,searching follows eighth grade as another thought provoking film about the intersection between teens  lives and their presence and reliance on social media  it helps when you have a lead like john cho  who after 20 years in the industry is finally bagging the kind of starring roles he deserves  an extremely tasty thriller that delivers exactly the right amount of suspense and twisty surprises  i was floored by the craft on display  the film doesn t understand what mode it wants to operate in  serious thriller with emotional stakes or contrived  cynical satire  some nice moves but as shallow as youtube celebrity  cho  messing  and la are excellent actors who are offered almost nothing to work with  that a thriller would come along utilizing these ideas was inevitable  what s unexpected is that it would be done so well  the distancing effect of technology turns the mawkish into something more meaningful and provides an impassive foil for david s meltdown  what holds searching together is its star  always an enjoyable comedian  cho has grown into a reliably good actor and aged nicely  providing a sad eyed soulfulness  wasting a decent performance from john cho as the desperate father of a missing teen  this film never commits to a cogent reason why it had to be told in such a way  searching may strike older viewers as a novel experimental film  but more importantly it s a genuine white knuckling exploration of our relationship with disruptive technology and how that impacts one average american family s daily life  
1840,loveless_2018,all three leads give subtly wrenching performances that wouldn t have been out of place in ingmar bergman s oeuvre  
1841,cold_war_2018,if kulig  who resembles jessica chastain  were american  hollywood would be offering her everything  
1842,deadpool_2,everything that you got in the first film  you get times three  i don t think the second film is terrible  i did find it quite dull  reynolds s underlying sweetness takes the edge off the comic s homicidal self pity  though the endless shtick has a miss to hit ratio of about three to one  deadpool 2 goes bigger than the first  but the shockingly touching family theme pulls all of the new characters and big set pieces together well  another wild  hilarious ride for the character with just enough honesty and heart  nearly everything about the original deadpool was fresh and funny  from the opening credits to the parody of marvel movie finales  deadpool 2 suffers the fate of so many sequels  we ve seen its best ideas before  depending on your appetite for this stuff  the constant self reference and breaking of the fourth wall is either a shameful cheat or a release from the sameness of the superhero template  his jibber jabber gets tiresome after a while  however  and irreverent  subversive and shocking humour is funny only upto a point  after which  the grand action scenes aside  it feels like a pattern  offend  kill  make an inside marvel joke  repeat  just as robert downey  jr  has become the definitive iron man  ryan reynolds is deadpool  it s the role he was born to play and whenever he s on screen  the movie s inner classic shines forth  all in all  i prefer a marvel movie that doesn t take itself seriously  but the nonstop unseriousness of deadpool 2 can wear you down  too  instead of seeking to top the over the top antics of the first film   both director and star are  content to simply groove with what they ve already established and just have fun  the result is less exhausting and more entertaining  deadpool 2 embraces its enhanced output of blood  guns  and violence with open arms   before they re blown off  
1843,shirkers,what tan has given us is an incredible  sui generis tribute to the international lingua franca of d i y  cinempowerment  it s a charming  wistful movie  and i trust tan will not have to wait another 20 years to direct her next film  deeply personal  fabulously engrossing  it sends you wondering at all the wild creativity and genius of young irrepressible women lost to time  held up or buried by the domineering egos of men  with fascinating bravery  tan goes backward in time in order to move toward a rectified future  confronting the memory of her complex  near inappropriate relationship with cardona  both an enabler and a betrayer  there is a sense of relief at the end of the documentary that feels like the first big breath of fresh air after stepping out of a therapist s office  with shirkers  tan doesn t indulge in nostalgia  but rather evokes an un calculated  offbeat sensibility that feels distant from our current algorithmic driven culture  the viewer  more than the filmmaker herself  may lament where tan s career might have gone  but she seems intent on moving forward   and this project may well be the vehicle for it  
1844,wildlife_2018,there s no shaking the feeling that this sort of study of all american repression has been done to death  
1845,border_2018,i found this compelling as i watched it  though i don t feel i gained much from the experience  the film huddles closely around a personality whose courage and determination invite great empathy  writer director ali abbasi has crafted something eerie and rather wonderful with this pungent allegory of outsiderdom  maybe best to think of it as a chilly scandinavian bedtime tale  the type to unsettle bothersome children and leave them identifying with the ogre  don t read another word about it  just go  it    gnaws at the brain for its subliminal messages about how we treat the people in our midst who don t fit whatever definition of  normal  we re carrying around with us  border is less invested in glib symbolism or political commentary than in the specific  felt experience of being adrift between social boundaries and categories  even the most open minded viewers may have difficulty relating to the two lead protagonists in border  a cynical swedish romantic fantasy  
1846,annihilation,the more familiar aspects of annihilation are enlivened by the entirely female dynamic  who seldom conform to simplistic group archetypes  gina rodriguez steals the show with a standout performance  drawing on mythology and body horror  annihilation is an intelligent film that asks big questions and refuses to provide easy answers  sci fi at its best  top notch sci fi and a chilling allegory for humanity s capacity for self destruction  here as in ex machina  2015   garland s creative  lan comes from his merging of sleek conceptual art and messy  juicy drama  making movies steeped in vagueness these days is proving to be an excellent way to earn critical praise  but being artfully ambiguous strikes me as a way to cover for not being able to finish the job  annihilation is some heady nightmare fuel  but its most striking quality may be how little it has in common with the current trends in mainstream science fiction  the kind of film that made me stand around outside the theater as it closed for thirty minutes with my friends talking about it  
1847,the_tale,the tale excels in these absurdist meta moments  such as the scenes in which dern and n lisse meet up across time to deconstruct events as they happen  
1848,the_guilty_2018,builds to an explosively emotional climax that had me choking back tears as it delivered one gut wrenching punch to the stomach after another  
1849,hannah_gadsby_nanette,hannah gadsby spins her own life story into a clever  raging and confronting spiel against misogyny  homophobia and even the tired old tropes of comedy itself  gadsby is tired of censoring her own pain for the sake of making audiences feel comfortable  nanette is a testament to this  it s time to make audiences feel uncomfortable in order to wake them up  i am also exactly who this special is for  for gadsby s fury is directed at people like me with laser like acumen  humor and sobering grace  you can believe this was a show that existed only in this moment and you feel elevated from being a part of it  gadsby explains how comedy works  how tension is broken to bring relief  by the end  there is no relief for the audience  but perhaps there is some for gadsby  after years of telling jokes  she is finally telling her story  she offers an alternative to privilege and hate that is so simple  so beautiful and so right  it shimmers  it might not be the funniest routine you watch all year  but it s unique  and it will make you think  in nanette we witness the shock of the new  a voice that dares to speak to this frustrating and often hideous cultural moment  a comedian willing to drop the act  i would call gadsby a genius  but she would likely push back against that term  hannah gadsby s nanette is the mic drop to end all mic drops a cross between comedy special and one woman show that s actually a 69 minute dear john letter to the entire enterprise of stand up  
1850,you_were_never_really_here,the film is technically impressive in every respect with fine  fluid camerawork by thomas townend and an impressive electronic music score by jonny greenwood  
1851,tea_with_the_dames,we re offered the precious illusion that we re close enough with four pillars of english theatre that they re chatting to us about their memories and feelings  that we get to see them as people and as friends  
1852,blindspotting,one of my favorite movies i ve seen so far this year  
1853,love_simon,simon and his friends are likeable kids and their romantic problems are affectionately explored  thanks to a dynamic  emotionally astute script from berger and aptaker  that coupled with berlanti s unobtrusive direction helps make this movie an agreeable revelation i likely couldn t have resisted even if i had wanted to  
1854,custody_2018,custody makes gripping drama from a difficult subject  the events that unfold in this brilliant and troubling movie are all too real  a peerless fusing of dumbshow performance and background sound editing  there s a rising panic that allows the final  violent closing act to seem shockingly organic  legrand in his feature debut shows laudable technical ability and discipline  xavier legrand s flawless feature debut morphs into a meticulously premeditated nightmare in its final act  we ve all seen these sorts of domestic bogeymen before in any number of lifetime movies  but rarely are they presented with the matter of fact naturalism that legrand brings to his venice silver lion winner  emotionally bruising but not without some glimmer of hope  did i mention this movie isn t for the weakhearted  it s a curious dichotomy that impresses on a directorial level even as it hedges on a psychological one  custody is concerned with the failure of process to discern human need and perversion  and xavier legrand rather ironically follows in the footsteps of bureaucracy by reducing people to statistics  buried amid a week of non inspiring film releases  this french gem is well worth ferreting out  human beings aren t always straight with each other  with thrilling skill  legrand and his team find a crooked path to clarity  
1855,bumblebee,the film presents late 80s america so fetishistically that it feels at times like a follow up to bennett miller s foxcatcher  2014   and its recycling of 80s teen movie cliches are also weirdly reverential  at times very funny  bumblebee is still at heart a big ol  b movie  but less bumbling and bombastic than its post dated predecessors  a frustrating joy ride  it d be twice as good if it was half as long  if only not being terrible was the same as being good  bumblebee is still just reheated nostalgia  the movie works in large part because of the depth of steinfeld s performance  we haven t seen such a well realized character in any of the other transformers movies  after the cacophonous abomination that was michael bay s transformers  the last knight  i suppose the mere whiff of competency smells good in comparison  with its close focus on charlie and on her hardworking mother  pamela adlon   it makes a cogent and timely argument for enlivening tired male properties with a female focused narrative  there s way more than meets the eye going on here  and i for one i m blissfully happy about that   with bumblebee  travis knight   finds the honey suckle sweet spot in a john hughes steven spielberg inspired coming of age blockbuster  
1856,mandy_2018,there really are some extraordinary scenes  
1857,rbg,this lively film tracks ginsburg s brilliant legal career  fighting for women s workplace rights while shrewdly also taking on cases where men suffered discrimination  
1858,zama,a beguiling cinematic journey through identity formation in latin america  
1859,in_between_2018,during an era where so many of us are desperately looking for comfort  i can think of no cinematic message more fitting for 2018 than this one  in between suffers when cross cutting among its three similar yet disparate storylines  and is strongest during moments that see righteous anger get complicated by human nature  
1860,ralph_breaks_the_internet,ralph breaks the internet would ve been a fun but soulless movie if not for its nuanced and necessary story about friendship  movies don t get more timely than ralph breaks the internet   an exhilarating yet dismaying sequel to 2012 s wreck it ralph  for my money easily the smartest and most endearing disney animated feature of recent years  conceptually  it s rather ingenious  with well aimed barbs at abusive commenter culture and social media narcissism that adds up to a welcome moral for small fry    the nuanced friendship between ralph and vanellope remains the most engaging part of the film  once you ve overcome the slight weirdness of a hulking man being best mates with a small girl  a persistent kowtowing to corporate interests flattens the satire  more logos will fly at punters during the film than they are likely to encounter in the preceding commercials  still  beneath the plethora of in joke easter eggs and already dated social media gags lies a film on a pixar like mission to make parents blub into their popcorn  surprisingly enjoyable  if not predictable  it s pretty incredible to see how the filmmakers easily and boldly slip concepts right from the therapist s office into the wild rumpus through the internet  it s not every animation that features an ebay spoofing riff involving a corn chip shaped like beyonc   i am happy to say that the misogynists  worst fears were realized  this is very much a movie whose female characters are equal to their male counterparts    as bold and smart a story about what it means to live online as any we ve ever come up with    ralph breaks the internet takes the characters into a whole new world  relying on disney tropes of old and moving them into an environment that s changed so much since video games were in vogue  somewhere between ready player one and the emoji movie  summoning up a zero gravity spectacle of dazzling colours and vertiginous perspectives  a featureless and inert mashup of memes  brands  avatars and jokes  
1861,the_cakemaker,natural performances from kalkhof and adler root the melodrama in genuine pathos  credit first time writer director ofir raul graizer with pulling off something of a miracle  a tender  tactile and just sweet enough story of hidden love  challenged faith and unwittingly shared grief  kalkhof has perfect chemistry with both miller and adler  the characters don t have to talk for the audience to feel the loss  love and desire they re experiencing  a terrifically impressive feature debut by israeli writer director ofir raul graizer  the cakemaker is more of a petit four than a belly bomb  but it s striking in its particularity  
1862,science_fair,an irresistible documentary that brims with youthful spirit and high ideals  
1863,foxtrot_2018, writer director samuel  moaz is a daring  unpredictable storyteller  and his eccentric plot construction  which also takes into account the son s last days  turns an intimate emotional drama into a larger statement about fate and justice  hellerian surrealism  slapstick comedy  there are many tones and textures set against two backdrops in samuel maoz s long awaited follow up to lebanon  maoz definitely knows how to knock a film together  so fingers crossed that the window between this and his next one is a lot more narrow  before the retrospective letdown  there is an exhilarating kind of disorientation as we move from one narrative section to the next  divided into three unequal sections  the film has a powerful message about life in contemporary israel  a message some will find confronting  like a self inflicted wound  it leaves a mark  the best thing to be said of this well intentioned film is that it doesn t resort to lecturing  a despairing work that s not quite as gripping as its predecessor   foxtrot  still manages to make a powerful statement about the unintended side effects of living in a constant state of war  particularly impressive is ashkenazi  who brings to michael a soulful but volatile insecurity  it s a hauntingly realized performance  the results are stunning  foxtrot takes us from unfathomable mourning to soul numbing tedium and back again  it is both delicate allegory and dark indictment  
1864,oh_lucy_2018,as willful  selfish  and cruel as ferrell s screen dunces   shinobu terajima  blunders into one humiliating situation after another  hardly sympathetic but never less than human  nothing here is wrapped up with a red ribbon the way it would be in an american film  studio made or otherwise  oh lucy  has the guts to leave things messy and unkempt  just like life  an idiosyncratic character study suggesting that the road to self knowledge is beset with obstacles and uncertainties  although lucy is on a journey of self discovery  she often hurts others in her quest for herself  that makes hirayanagi s take on the later in life coming of age story more honest than most  the treatment of its central character veers so wildly between the sympathetic and just plain pathetic that there s a blur where the movie s heart ought to be  hirayanagi gives her lead respect by framing her specific dilemma in a way that feels sincere  within the confines of this cross cultural shaggy dog tale  hirayanagi locates both a sharp vein of absurdist comedy and a bitter  melancholy undertow  hirayanagi isn t selling a packaged idea about what it means to be human  she does something trickier and more honest here  merely by tracing the ordinary absurdities and agonies of one woman s life  hirayanagi introduced a more broadly comic setsuko in her 2014 short of the same title  and her feature screenplay  written with boris frumin  still finds humor in the character s flailing attempts to break free from habitual loneliness and obedience  the tone see saws wildly  what prevents it collapsing are the warm  heartfelt performances  together with hirayanagi s obvious affection for her chief protagonist  while it s uneven  and at times seems almost artless in its craft  the story has an idiosyncratic charm that pays off in an unexpectedly touching ending  
1865,sweet_country_2018,indigenous actor hamilton morris is quietly magnificent in his first screen role  
1866,night_comes_on,the quest plot puts a solid frame around what s essentially a sensitive study of a shattered family  poorly served by the social institutions meant to keep them safe  an unusual and interesting feature that tries to convey the inner state of a non communicative young woman mainly through reaction shots of her face  
1867,hale_county_this_morning_this_evening,at the same time that hale county s collage style helps the film avoid becoming a southern variation on hoop dreams  it refuses to lapse into anything resembling hand wringing melancholy  a visually mesmerizing but only half illuminating documentary on black lives in the deep south  hale county this morning  this evening has an impressive pedigree but that wouldn t count for much if it didn t achieve its aim to find a new language for the overlooked parts of neglected lives  but it does    lovingly  at every juncture  ross elects for ambiguity and poses a question to the viewer to answer how black bodies are viewed  encouraging the audience to perform the labour of challenging their expectations  there is something visionary in this film  hale county is a kind of mini epochal calendar art  turning its seasonal pages  with a heavier hand it would have become tendentious or messagey  vividly sketches african american lives on an alabama trek that bypasses stereotypes and narrative conceit  proceeding directly to empathy  you could call it a transcendental scrapbook  because it wipes away the muck of subjectivity that guides most movies  it turns the audience into direct receptors of experience  a 76 minute visual poem that pays homage to folks who still harbor hopes and dreams despite a hardscrabble existence  a poetic documentary with a gift for making enrapturing imagery out of what sound like ordinary  everyday events  though made modestly and intimately  the film embodies a vast conceptual and aesthetic ambition  ross s camera captures the banal  the tragic and the triumphant alike  never lingering on any one moment for too long  and using a dreamy editing technique that doesn t always spell out its associations for us  
1868,ryuichi_sakamoto_coda,reality and cinema combine seamlessly as editor hisayo kushida transitions from studio recordings to film clips that outline an eclectic career  
1869,rodents_of_unusual_size,rodents of unusual size is also a look at how human folly can contribute to environmental disaster  but awareness and ingenuity can help bail us out  the film s initial non judgmental perspective eventually sounds more like a public service announcement    a bizarre and fascinating documentary that ll make your jaw drop  depicting the resilience of both the nutria and the louisianans who ve endured their presence for many years  rodents of unusual size proves enjoyably quirky and informative  
1870,pick_of_the_litter,though it could benefit from more context and history of guide dogs and a little less walk footage  the film offers compelling insight into a process most know little about and whether they make the cut or not  there s a happy ending for every dog  yes  the structural constraints and the emotional rhythms of reality tv competition shows are all over this  but it s mostly irresistible  the dogs  personalities  highlighted by a handy name tag graphic every time each one gets a segment  bound and yap off the screen  this is exactly the movie we need right now  viewers of all ages with a fondness for puppies will find it hard to resist   pick of the litter  is made with heart and reverence for man s best friend  especially those special pooches who go on to answer a higher calling  by far the most joyous time you ll have at the movies all year  i ve always wondered how guide dogs are trained and  now that i ve seen the documentary pick of the litter  i m still not quite sure  as deficient as it is in specifics  it s fairly enjoyable anyway   pick  often feels like a project that has been overly groomed  will you still be moved to tears  most likely  doggie cuteness and the inherent emotional pull of canine human companionship wins in the end  subject matter alone makes pick of the litter  if not especially memorable  a gently lovable outing  bans on talking in movie theaters should be briefly lifted for anyone who can t resist shouting  go  poppet   on test days  which should be almost everyone  
1871,marlina_the_murderer_in_four_acts,to its credit  the film eschews excess gore and mayhem  largely making its points in more subtly incisive ways  marlina the murderer in four acts recalls the oaters of sergio leone and his brethren  all right  but it upends the usual male concerns for some serious and satisfying feminist payback  it s one of those features from a distant part of the globe that seems like it may have been created primarily for western art houses and festivals  where its exemplary direction and feminist theme are indeed likely to win surya new fans  working with the cinematographer yunus pasolang  ms  surya gives  marlina  a stark  steady  captivating look that keeps you largely engaged even when the story and your attention drift  the film is enlivened by an acute grasp of the impossibilities that abused indonesian women face in a society predicated on their continued physical and emotional subjugation to men  with a morricone inspired score  gorgeous cinematography that screams to be witnessed on a big screen  and bleak humor  this film s tightly executed  meticulously controlled surface barely contains the seething fury within  it s worth seeing for its unpredictable yarn spinning and timothy s noble performance  at once tightly controlled and simmering with righteous fury  it s gorgeously lensed  atmospherically scored and moves inexorably toward a gratifying payoff  it s a small  offbeat movie  punctuated by bursts of terrible violence but also infused with a winning strain of deadpan humor that s not too far removed from jim jarmusch  at once an enjoyable genre ride and a feminist arthouse story  marlina the murderer in four acts might send some heads rolling but has its own head firmly on its shoulders  
1872,tully_2018,this stylistic maturity is typical of writers  who tend to improve  tully is one of the best comedies of the year  fluttering between dark family fair and a mary poppins self help guide reitman does succeed at showcasing the sympathetic imagination and flesh impact of his two stars in authentic scenes of domestic mess and cleanup  and cody attains new legitimacy and veracity as a writer  if who you were is who you still are is an existential question tully raises with charlize theron as its center and forces you to wonder for yourself  too  whether you re a mother or not  the emotions tully surfaces aren t comforting  and they have less to do with the actual realities of motherhood than with the idea of motherhood as something that leaves you forever changed and cut off from your younger self  it s a slight story enlarged to universal dimensions by the sharpness of cody s dialogue and the acuteness of her insights into the domestic pile up that constitutes marlo s day  tully fails on every level except one  charlize theron wakes it from its lethargy  takes it by the jugular  and squeezes until it yells  tully is a walking film script  and the best thing that can be said about the film is that a group of very talented actors works very hard to make its contrivances pass as plausible  tully is emotionally complex  bleakly funny and only slightly depressing  reitman doesn t embellish  he allows cody s screenplay and theron s withered  fearlessly unfettered magnificence to do all of the heavy lifting  in  tully   the cynicism about the supposed undiluted joys of motherhood rings true  or at least truer than in movies that don t admit such a station in life can be less than paradise  the act of tending an infant is handled with some of the grimmest humor this side of eraserhead  cody s writing has never been better  i don t think it s a stretch to propose a charlize theron day  the actor has been so good  for so long  that she deserves at least 24 hours  worth of recognition  
1873,leaning_into_the_wind,a friend who watched this with me said that it s the kind of film she d like to see again when she s dying  that pretty much nails its meditative  melancholy tone    it s  andy  goldsworthy s version of a snow angel  a simple transitory image that will make you feel oddly happy during its short  earthbound existence  no matter how vivid your home setup might be  it s best to see this in a theatre  there are moments where you may want to stop the film to assure yourself you re seeing what you re seeing  so disordering to the senses are goldsworthy s re orderings of nature  this is one of the most relaxing experiences i have had watching a movie in a long time  he describes two ways of approaching the world   you can walk on the path  or you can walk through the hedge   even at its most self conflicted  this is a fascinating reminder that some art wasn t made to be owned  certain images are hokey  but leaning into the wind has a wandering  lonely purity  we feel as if we ve been allowed to fleetingly swim through goldsworthy s psyche  a nonfiction focused director and cinematographer frequently attracted to the intersection between artistic expression  nature  and spirituality  however unarticulated   riedelsheimer is well matched to goldsworthy s methods and interests  
1874,thunder_road_2018,in the spirit of many great comedians  jim cummings has a knack for taking lines that shouldn t be funny and transforming them into accidental zingers  cummings s feature debut doesn t always get the balance right  but when it does it packs a bittersweet punch  it takes a few narrative risks that won t win everyone over  but it allowed itself to be complex and conflicted about itself  that kept you on the edge of your seat  such an unapologetic crisis of masculinity will strike some as self indulgent in times such as these  yet cummings is so committed to arnaud s tragicomic trajectory    that you can t take your eyes off him  a performance showcase for star  writer  director  editor and composer jim cummings which leaves you in no doubt you ll be seeing more of him  the film shares something of its hero s self involvement  if you can accept that  however  thunder road is an impressive one man show  remarkably  cummings manages to piece these oddball vignettes into a vivid drama with its own unpredictable  startlingly lovely shape  i have seen humanistic american filmmaking s future  and its name is jim cummings  offers a memorable depiction of a man ill equipped to deal with or direct his feelings probably not all that different from the rest of us  driven by cummings  transfixingly vulnerable performance  the movie not only justifies returning to the source  shockingly  it does so without even using the device that seemed key to the short s success  thunder road lands on a tragic development  but upends it with a single teary eyed moment that hints   with no real evidence   that better things may be around the corner  cummings is a born filmmaker who plants seedlings of raw drama that sprout in unexpected and moving ways  
1875,the_ballad_of_buster_scruggs,couldn t look more like a carefully constructed omnibus if it emerged from the amicus imprint during the 1960s and featured christopher lee as the host and joan collins as the girl  
1876,i_am_not_a_witch,nyoni presents one dazzling set piece after another  
1877,western_2018,there s swagger and bluster  there are echoes of athina rachel tsangari s chevalier  and at least one purposeful reference to claire denis s beau travail  a meandering but quietly absorbing tale of comradeship amid social tensions  while the film hums with potential conflict  grisebach is too singular simply to dress an old genre in new clothes  instead  she coolly holds back her camera and paces out the escalation of hostilities under a humid balkan sun  packed with moments of beauty worthy of classic westerns  and makes you want to be more attentive towards others  writer director valeska grisebach is terrific with cultural details  especially since the characters can t really communicate  a culture clash defined by an incredibly strong first time performance  it s continually more emotionally surprising than its dry packaging lets on  a slow burn of a drama with a restrained tone that may put off some viewers  but which will captivate those who responded to its low key wavelength  the absence of anything traditionally  painterly  reflects an ambivalent attitude toward the kind of capitalistic pro growth machinations on display in the film  free of affectation and distinguished by a generosity and sincerity exceedingly rare in cinema  western s poignant celebration of human resilience is nothing short of spectacular  there are no stagecoaches or six shooters in this sharp  simmering drama of german bulgarian discord  but the spirit of john ford graces it  a naturalistic  almost documentary like feature that slowly builds  the film s visual execution and spare narrative style give it a timeless dimension that will lend some modestly exportable clout to an approachable and appealingly laconic drama  
1878,hearts_beat_loud,dramatic tension may be in short supply but hearts beat loud makes very pleasurable viewing precisely because it is so mellow and its very genial protagonists are so self effacing  
1879,blaze_2018,dickey looks like a big  shaggy dog with a wounded paw who s been left out in the rain overnight  and he s a real revelation  a songwriter making his major acting debut  dickey captures the burly  vulnerable quality of foley s lyrics and vocal delivery  creating a palpable sense that the songs were excavated from the darkest corners of his soul  dickey would have made a strong impression regardless  but it turns out he can act  and sing  and has a genuine magnetism that combines with an endearing quality to create a highly appealing screen presence  hawke argues movingly that creative success has nothing to do with fame and everything to do with how an artist grows as a person and impacts the people around him  ethan hawke continues scratching his artisty itch by directing and co writing a biopic of blaze foley that feels as raggedy shambling  jumbled  and sad  but secretly thoughtful and impressive  as the country music oddball himself  the great singer songwriter townes van zandt used to say there are two kinds of music  the blues and zip a dee doo dah  both are on full  florid display in blaze  an absorbing  illuminating film about the late musician blaze foley  every one of the relationships depicted crackles with history  tension and love  this a film about how we tell stories about the dead  and who gets to craft these legends  a valiant if studied effort  one that occasionally calls to mind terrence malick s 2017 freeform music drama   song to song   blaze feels like a true passion project  an engine running on hawke s endless supply of enthusiasm for his subject  blaze s first hour is a free floating  refreshingly exposition free exploration of an aloof talent who s never quite there  mr  hawke is clearly motivated by nothing but affection for blaze  townes  sybil and the state of texas  he doesn t so much scramble biopic conventions as allow himself and the audience to be distracted from them  at its best  blaze feels like a cinematic translation of not just blaze foley s life but his music  anchored by two incredibly likable  lived in performances  
1880,to_all_the_boys_ive_loved_before,thrills in part because most viewers are all too familiar with what it feels like to baldly deny feelings for another person even as they become patently obvious to everyone else  a pleasant and perfectly relatable situation comedy about a 16 year old s awkward first attempts at dating  
1881,revenge_2018,a stunning reinvention of the rape revenge exploitation film that had me sitting at the edge of my seat first frame to last  what happens next is expected a roaring rampage of revenge  with each of the three hunters confronted like a video game boss but fargeat has some fun tricks to deploy  revenge won t be an experience every viewer can handle  but as a piece of extreme horror  it s an intelligent and flashy debut  if you usually find the genre icky and exploitative  try this one but only if you ve got the stomach for an abattoir s worth of blood in a single movie  torture and injury ensue  but nothing is as off putting as the visual excesses which smack of student film making beneath the high production values    revenge is part trashy exploitation flick  part looney tunes romp  it s a film that manages to leer at its scantily clad heroine only to eventually make you root for her to dish out as much bloody punishment as possible  though the film makes a valiant effort to subvert a sexist formula by shrouding itself in french art film trappings and pseudo empowering femininity  it ultimately falls prey to its exploitative roots  it all becomes very silly and very panto    the claims for feminist credibility feel very last ditch indeed  the film is going to strain your suspension of disbelief to the breaking point  but if you can get past one particular event  you re going to find revenge a madcap  satisfying thrill ride  offers a woman s pov on the age old tale and succeeds in turning a b concept soaked in blood into a pure adrenaline rush of terror  grounded firmly in the real and horrifying dynamics that breed rape culture  the film we need right now  from a filmmaker we need right now  
1882,filmworker,if there is a cult around kubrick  vitali was the first card carrying member  that s where the greatest qualms may come in this stylish and sometimes overly reverential portrait  it s as if vitali never really existed without the director   filmworker  is a first rate account of the ongoing creative process some call dysfunctional  well  anyone would call it that  actually  but some would also call it worth it   filmworker s  greatest value lies in pulling the lens back to allow viewers to understand film as a deeply collaborative medium  one in which even the most venerated auteurs cannot accomplish their greatest feats alone  whether you re fascinated by kubrick or the human condition this is a minor classic  next time you watch a kubruck movie  take note of the high contrast black and white  or of how consistent the colors have remained over the decades  thanks  mr  vitale  tony zierra s fond and slightly unsettling film is  among other things  a reminder of the egolessness necessary for great egos to flourish  the interviewees in filmworker are lit unflatteringly and not always asked the most pertinent of questions    but some of them offer telling glimpses of how this relationship looked from the outside  anybody with any interest in kubrick will be diverted by filmworker  but it remains an oddly clunky piece of work  it s a fascinating movie  hosted largely by vitali himself  now older  no doubt wiser  though still visibly excited and perplexed by the enigmatic genius whom he served  by revealing the darker side of kubrick  we re given an original take on his legacy  watching filmworker as a cinephile  it s easy to be awed by the zen like devotion of vitali s life s work  but it s also possible to be simultaneously filled with rage at the way people like him are simply left to run endlessly on their hamster wheels  compelling  despite its modest and uneven means  
1883,beast,not since sissy spacek fell in with martin sheen in badlands has an actress taken us through the process of swapping home and hearth for a homicidal maniac with the manic intensity buckley displays here  strong performances push the story along  it s not so much about solving a mystery as it is about inner turmoil and the stories we tell ourselves  be they fairy tales or not  immaculately composed yet skittish  edgy and surprising  this impressive debut by writer director michael pearce emanates a chill that will have you hugging your sides  the dark nail biter eschews the obvious at every turn and is less a whodunit than a twisted moral meditation grounded by its mesmerizing leading lady  beast walks the line between taut psychological thriller and doomed genre romance  pearce takes his time laying out his sleeping with the enemy tale  but his stinginess with plot lends the film an vice tightening air of mystery that suits it  pearce has some mildly wicked fun with his scenario  winking as he stages such routine thriller flick maneuvers as having the lights suddenly cut out  with the assured script and deft direction from pearce  along with buckley s complex and nuanced performance  we never know what s actually going on in her head  
1884,lean_on_pete,for all its sometimes over episodic structure  haigh has crafted a quietly affecting coming of age journey tale sustained by a central performance that never feels forced or contrived  
1885,on_her_shoulders,it would almost be absurd if it weren t so deadly serious  
1886,the_wolf_house,it s the disney s golden age enchantment by way of horror master wes craven  done with resourceful virtuosity    the wolf house undoubtedly has sharp and fascinating pints to make    but those messages get lost in a slow moving avalanche of undeniably impressive images that never quite touch the emotions in the way they are meant   the wolf house  reminds us that fairy tales are powerful because  once upon a time  we were all young enough to believe them  its visual landscape is unlike any i ve experienced  and though everything about it is aggressively repellant  it still managed to hold me in a constant state of gobsmacked awe  the deeply uncanny pic makes for an unsettling viewing experience  a creative tour de force whose endlessly fascinating visuals are deliberately seductive and repellent in equal measure  
1887,1985_2018,all of the acting is very good  although some american commentators have remarked on the fact no one has a texas accent  this won t matter much to an australian audience  what really distinguishes the film is that it gets deep inside this broken family without becoming histrionic or accusatory  tan avoids any hint of sentimentality  concentrating on the pain instead  the writer director offers no easy solutions  relying instead on a stellar cast and nuanced responses  what makes 1985 such a heartbreaking film is its refusal to contextualize adrian s suffering against the ongoing aids epidemic  1985 feels like a missing minor classic from the decade that preceded the rise of the so called new queer cinema  this profoundly resonant  smartly understated black and white film greatly benefits from more than 30 years worth of sociosexual perspective that reminds us how much has changed  yet how much else has not  all the performances are very good  though one might ask why no one has a regional accent   with stage trained smith providing a center of quiet intensity  anchored by a deeply felt central performance from cory michael smith  the modest but affecting film should find a receptive niche with lgbt audiences  
1888,dark_money, dark money  exposes the dangers of unbridled  anonymous political spending so expertly that it will make you fume with anger  practically quake with distress  activist in tone  and paced like a thriller  reed s movie painstakingly details how an election can be brusquely seized and swayed by unseen forces  damning  clear eyed  and as gripping as any john grisham thriller   it  will either bore you to death or boil your blood  as a washington political junkie  i fall into the latter camp  your results may vary  it s not an insult to call this an exemplary pbs documentary  let s just say you should make sure you are really in the mood for a pbs doc before you check out dark money  there s not a dull or dry moment in reed s briskly paced film about the secret assault on the american electoral and judicial process by corporations whose agenda is nothing less than the dismantling of government itself  kimberly reed s approach is too bloodless to make us feel the full weight of the injustices her film identifies  reed s sophomore feature is straightforward reportage  telling a complex  multi issue story with a large number of players  in admirably cogent terms  a densely packed documentary that earnestly and obsessively addresses campaign finance reform  its history and vital importance  
1889,good_manners,yet while it s refreshing to see teen lycanthropy handled as something other than a metaphor for sexual awakening  good manners dawdles on its way to a surprisingly predictable and unearned resolution  there are moments to treasure throughout  from lovely out of nowhere musical numbers to the beautiful hand drawn stills that depict a key flashback  
1890,support_the_girls,this chicken wing emporium becomes a handy metaphor for women making their way through the patriarchy in writer director andrew bujalski s observant and trenchantly funny new film  
1891,capernaum,it s essential viewing for the ways in which it illuminates brutally hard lives many of us could otherwise not imagine  and for the craft of its nonprofessional performers  capernaum s odyssey  in which zain battles the hazards of shantytowns  souks  prisons and betrayals with wily  angry energy  paints him as a resourceful figure fighting impossible odds rather than the passive child victim of charity adverts  rafeea  a non professional actor and syrian refugee  is the film s secret weapon  at times  the tragedy unfolding on screen feels borderline unwatchable  but his strange  fascinating  eerily adult face offers a litany of minute expressions  a clunky  hanky dampening mechanism is lost in a dazzling collision of social commentary  brash characterisation and coal black humour  labaki is so skilled at directing children here   director nadine  labaki elicits an astonishing performance from her young lead  labaki directs the inexperienced cast sensitively  and mixes appalled commentary on the bureaucracy conspiring against the disenfranchised with the occasional indelible image  with two astonishing child performances  capernaum is a real heart breaker  it can make ken loach look happy go lucky but it s a gripping  sympathetic cry for the dispossessed   capernaum  overcomes its built in clich s to forcefully tell a story as urgent as the latest breaking news bulletin  labaki s film is an eye opener   a seemingly authentic exploration of the world of the dispossessed of lebanon s capital city  made by a director who is clearly passionate about bringing this particular story to world audiences  labaki makes you want to squeeze into zain s shoes  if just for a couple of hours  
1892,the_endless,the biggest lesson of the endless is how we can allow our lives to loop around in one crappy cycle until we cop out  despite an imaginative concept  the narrative feels surprisingly bland  even when the pieces begin to fall into place   and when there s no quick punchline to fall back on  the film suffers  a mind bending m bius strip of a movie  this indie sci fi makes up for what it lacks in budget with a wealth of playful ideas  it s slightly baffling at times  but always inventive and disquieting  there is a very good idea for a really intriguing  startling film here  that finally gets a little lost in its own freakily cosmic claustrophobia  this impressive low budget indie weaves a genre defying tapestry of weirdness  atmospherics and cultish horrors across a dusty us setting  benson and moorhead navigate this tricky terrain skilfully both in front of as well as behind the camera  their performances low key and naturalistic  allowing the leads to be comfortably mundane while the circumstances around them prove anything but  this is benson and moorhead s most professionally made movie to date  but they hold on to an amateurish enthusiasm that works largely for the best  the endless goes places both eerily unexpected and emotionally affecting  the all encompassing monstrous beauty of this spellbinding sci fi thriller impossible to understate   the endless  gets into your head and keeps you alert for whatever abnormal turn comes next  great use of an eerie southern california landscape and some fine  naturalistic acting emphasizes how the ordinary can sometimes seem threatening   and vice versa  
1893,private_life_2018,scenes of painful turmoil play like skillful script readings rather than life events  
1894,american_animals,other directors have folded real world figures into fictional narratives  it s the scale of the invasion that sets layton s project apart  the movie reaches strange and savage heights   not just because it seems to be engaging with huge philosophical questions about the nature of identity in the modern world  it s more focused than that  because the context is specifically american  american animals manages to be simultaneously fast paced and contemplative  i was on the edge of my seat  a documentary about the fictions we tell ourselves  a fiction about the reality we can never escape  american animals is sharp  smart  often bravura filmmaking  a terrifically entertaining mix of fast facts and pulp fiction  but beneath the flash is a sad story of teens who feel their lives simply aren t good enough  every actor turns in a enthralling performance and the four subjects have sincere  intelligent  and charismatic personalities  but it doesn t change the fact that making a film about them is an advertisement for while male privilege in america   the kids   meticulous preparations begin with typing  how to plan a heist  into google and continue with watching every heist film ever made  though they manage to overlook the primary lesson of all such films that something always goes wrong  it hits the usual genre beats  and plays a predictable rock soundtrack as it lurches between comedy and drama  but neither the story nor the characters really mesh  american animals offers a truly poignant look at what it costs us to cross an invisible line between right and wrong  
1895,cam,an excellent showcase for brewer  who carries this movie through so many tense passages and helps viewers immediately recognize the complicated human behind the camera  
1896,mary_poppins_returns,from the introductory shot  gliding through the clouds on that parrot handled brolly  blunt takes staggeringly self assured charge  
1897,creed_ii,battle fatigue sets in roughly halfway through this eighth installment of sylvester stallone s rocky franchise  
1898,teen_titans_go_to_the_movies,appropriately super  it s encouraging to see someone at dc approaching this material as an opportunity for colourful fun rather than a grim matter of rights maintenance  smart and stupid in equal measure  this is a palate cleanser after the doom and gloom of justice league  the titans could make you fall back in love with the entire dc universe  spun off from a cartoon network tv series  this is a self reflexive exercise  most of the gags in this pandering spoof are about their own schematic nature   they re jokes about how you re smarter than the jokes  while the kids at the screening i attended laughed hysterically at the fart jokes  the parents chuckled at the slightly more sophisticated humour and the adult geeks howled at the deeper pop cultural references  it is aimed at elementary schoolers  but is sharp and light enough that any fan of the superhero genre will enjoy its take on the comic universe and its pokes at superhero conventions  it makes fun of itself and then it makes fun of itself for making fun of itself  and then it makes fun of us for watching so many superhero movies  a refreshingly lighthearted take on these characters and cinematic universe  here s hoping their attitude is infectious  this is deeply steeped in pop culture and in comic book references  but there s context  it s not just self referential  it s also commenting on itself in ways that are really subversive and really daring  i was shocked  if this silly  silly movie accomplishes nothing else  it has rendered it utterly impossible for anyone to depict batman s origin onscreen  ever again  with a straight face  
1899,colette_2018,the movie s treatment of her same sex affairs may be as tasteful as the set design  but the film is an absorbing introduction to a trailblazing artist   keira knightley  gets far more to do and is infinitely better at it than usual in the brisk new period piece colette westmoreland gives us a heroine as mighty as anything from marvel  given vivid life by knightley in the role of this fearless actor s career  knightley and west have a tremendous chemistry  two very smart and worldly performances that suggest that colette and willy did enjoy something like a real love affair    for all its meticulous embroidery around a very singular life  colette speaks to our moment quite tartly too    a dutiful biopic of a fascinating woman that should have taken itself less seriously  in her best role since saul dibb s 2008 period drama the duchess  knightley brings colette to life with a performance that blends grit with glamour in seemingly effortless fashion  all the affairs and scandals that a french literary genius could wish for  with the bonus of a modern heroine and a story that acknowledges the diversity that has always been with us  there s something about the figure of colette whose ye olde punk rock feminist spirit of throwing caution and convention to the wind electrifies knightly  her performance comes alive here in ways we ve rarely seen from her before  it s a modest but handsome production  lovingly photographed by giles nuttgens and mostly filmed in hungary  with period trappings that seem authentic in every respect  there s more going on in colette than tame hagiography  the results are happily vibrant  even if the sexual inequities depicted remain grimly pertinent  
1900,parasite_2019,a tragicomic masterclass that will get under your skin and eat away at your cinematic soul  
1901,avengers_endgame,endgame consists almost entirely of the downtime scenes that were always secretly everyone s favorite parts of these movies anyway  
1902,knives_out,built upon a wittily verbose script that delivers more laugh out loud lines than most of the year s alleged comedies  knives out retains a beating human heart into which daggers are regularly plunged  
1903,us_2019,fearsomely entertaining  consistently thought provoking and occasionally bloody scary  
1904,toy_story_4,not absolute top flight pixar  no embarrassment either  toy story has been winning and warming hearts since 1995  debutant director josh cooley takes charge of this fourth instalment  which boasts exemplary digital artistry  
1905,the_irishman,it didn t take a genius to see that television was finally poised to win the war against movies  i just didn t expect my teacher to be leading the charge against theatrical exhibition  scorcese has made a film brimming with quiet power and subtle tension  for all its flash back flash forward tricksiness  the irishman rarely seems disjointed or thematically fractured  
1906,little_women_2019,one hundred and fifty year old literature never felt so alive  
1907,booksmart,with elegant clarity  booksmart demonstrates how certain experiences can feel colossal and of walloping import even when we know we re waiting for something else something we can t possibly fathom  
1908,the_farewell_2019,what follows is a series of hackneyed scenes about the different interpersonal relationships within the family  centering on the heroine s bond with her grandmother  magnificent screen presence  i thought it was really lovely  i thought it was really funny  i thought it was really moving  you will laugh  you will cry  you ll be spewing with tears before the first act is done  a lovely  warm family picture featuring a star making turn from awkwafina  wang s family story is modestly affecting and deserves an audience  but if it does prompt thoughts about weighing up the importance of emotional truth  they mainly come afterwards  there are no grand declarations or tear stained confrontations  as it s not downton  mercifully  and if you think grandma knows the truth and is fooling everybody else  you will need to think again  as it s just not clich d in this way  immigrant in jokes abound but this isn t a niche film  it s a crowd pleaser that s been a box office hit in the us  not every scene works but it s an enjoyable watch and awkwafina is a revelation in a central role  goes softly softly on the big themes  but packs an emotional wallop  both a vehicle for awkwafina s formidable talents and an incredibly charming ensemble piece  if there s any justice  it ll be remembered when it comes to award scattering season  immigrants  for whom such experiences often overlap in intimate ways  can tell some of the most compelling stories about the human condition and the dislocating shocks of modernity  launches no thunderbolts  no dazzling revelations  the film is too gentle for that  with too much affection for its characters  awkwafina finds her footing as a first time leading lady  excelling with her emotionally nuanced and vibrant performance in a story about familial love and the gray area one cultivates from straddling different homelands  
1909,a_beautiful_day_in_the_neighborhood,another tremendous film from one of our era s great young directors  heller evidently excels at these kinds of narratives  here  she presents an enchanting tale in which a cynic s world is turned upside down when he finds redemption in the most unlikely place  
1910,marriage_story_2019,what should feel authentic can often feel hokey  sanitized and a fairy tale of what a divorce could look like if people just got out of their own way  
1911,if_beale_street_could_talk,if beale street could talk will take you on a journey of visual ecstasy with narrative beats that create a solid adaptation of james baldwin s emotional material   pub date  sept 2018  just as the novel version of if beale street could talk moves between love story and protest novel  a balance baldwin strikes throughout many of his works  jenkins  adaptation uses flashbacks to oscillate between two worlds  jenkins doesn t scratch the surface of the black american experience  he takes you deep into its bones and suggests that far less has changed than the naive may believe  jenkins s film is a compendium of marvellous moments  lovingly observed vignettes of black working class life  but the unvarying tempo with which they are laid out for the viewer eventually creates a certain monotony holier than thou black sanctity  glutinous gospellings of martyrdom  beale street may seem a little arch at times  but it is also magical filmmaking which looks for  and finds  beauty in the most unlikely places  the plot could be straight out of a soap opera but  as its oscar nomination for best adapted screenplay suggests  the script offers something far more textured and complex jenkins has cemented his status as a very big deal  
1912,once_upon_a_time_in_hollywood,consummately acted by an unusually fine ensemble cast  the film will provoke and enthral  a sure indication the director has succeeded in making not only a handsome and nostalgic movie but also a challenging and subversive one  i can t say what this adds up to  i can only say i was never bored and while the ending   brace yourself   has proved divisive  a slow  indulgent ramble through a gloriously recreated past  placidly hypnotised by its own stately paced and luminous nostalgia  love it or loathe it  it s worth appreciating how rare it now is to have an original movie produced on such a lavish scale  there seems little doubt that every detail of the tableau has been selected to give  tarantino  pleasure  and we are being permitted to witness a private ritual of self gratification  on more than one level  if once upon a time    falls a long way short of meaningful  it still deserves credit for groping in its graceless way towards profound ideas about the restorative miracles of cinema and the consolation of lies projected at 24 frames per second  the plot is a tapestry template that drops in characters like shining beads and watches the story weave slowly around them  tarantino has become such a pro at telling these big canvas stories  you barely notice he s picked up the pace until it s fully cranking  
1913,spider_man_far_from_home,the stakes this time turn out to be considerably lower  and your friendly neighborhood spider teen is arguably just the guy to bring things down to earth and reestablish a human scale  the picture does a fair bit of narrative slaloming  each new twist revealing an ever more exasperating switcheroo  
1914,pain_and_glory,while still embracing the visual facades that make his films such a pleasure to watch  pain and glory finds him stripping away the emotional facades  bringing us closer to him than ever before  
1915,shazam,after lazy reliance on phoney gravitas and blundering with its first serious stab at levity with aquaman  dc has found a comic torch bearer of pure heart to illuminate the path of righteousness ahead  
1916,ford_v_ferrari,while ford v  ferrari finishes first on a technical level  it serves as a myopic altar to a sport and era of white male dominance  ford v ferrari is a little too long  some scenes leave unnecessary skidmark trails  but the movie still has amiable style and energy to spare  it s fast but never furious  it s a far from perfect film  but a richly entertaining one  with a twist that only devoted petrolheads will know is coming  it s still impeccably made  with mangold distilling the story into two essential parts  the thrill of the game  and the thrill of watching people who are good at their jobs do their jobs  there s still lots to enjoy about the film  which provides us with two wonderful lead performances  exciting speed races  and car executives wearing some of the most beautifully tailored suits this side of mad men  the film weathers its two and a half hour running time easily  even as it navigates a cheerfully formulaic sports movie structure  hitting the screen like a shot of pure unfiltered adrenaline  director james mangold s ford v ferrari is an outstanding historical character study  ford v ferrari takes the straightforward ethos of car racing where the winner is whoever is the fastest and lays bare the egotism and greed required for such a triumph  this film has no ambition except to entertain  and it does so exceedingly well  that s not something i take for granted  even henry ford ii gets the message here  sometimes you have to go along with the ride  it s a new and emotionally complex model of an old fashioned audience pleaser  with wonderful performances by christian bale and matt damon and a resonant soul to go with its smarts  
1917,dolemite_is_my_name,this riotous  poignant and uplifting true story couldn t have been told half as well without the singular magnetism and intensity of eddie murphy at its heart  good vibes are infectious only to a point  and two hours of strenuously conflict free high jinks  with didactic dialogue asserting moore s importance  eventually gets wearying  after its promising first act  craig brewer s film becomes a series of fleeting bits  allowing questions to pile up  we laugh every step of the way with moore and his fellow fringe showbiz hopefuls  we root for them to somehow break through  we care about them  
1918,the_lighthouse_2019,american writer director robert eggers excels at transporting you into the past and putting you under the skin of those you meet there  persuading you to be glad that you came is another matter  the lewd  overwrought  herman melville inspired dialogue is alternately mumbled and shouted  the intense  grand guignol performances more interesting as an experiment than conducive to eliciting meaning  the visceral  disgusting  and irrefutably maddening theatrics of the lighthouse are entrancing enough to have viewers happily giving themselves over to a beckoning siren by film s end  
1919,apollo_11_2019,clocking in at a tidy 90 minutes  laid out in ruthlessly linear fashion  the film plays like one deep breath nervously exhaled  it s also eye wateringly beautiful to behold sometimes gush is the only appropriate response and the amazingness never gets any less amazing  the director avoids gimmicks or embellishment  strapping three men to the top of a rocket and blasting them into space is  it turns out  sufficiently gripping on its own  todd douglas miller s 50th anniversary docu buster is everything it should be  with the possible exception of exciting  a masterpiece in storytelling which deserves to be seen on the biggest screen one could possibly find  the apollo is sprinkled with gems  williams places his film within the context of black history in this country while providing anecdotes about the theater itself  fascinating shots of hundreds of scientists glued to rows of video terminals and switchboards are reduced to mere wallpaper  the work at hand remains a mystery  apollo 11 is free of extraneous narration  which helps lend it a present tense feel  paradoxically  it s these quieter moments that make apollo 11 so breathtaking to behold  that perspective   what a group of individuals can do when coming together for a collective good   shapes everything we see  
1920,rocketman_2019,rocketman ramps the camp up to 11  throws on some sequinned spectacles  and sparks fireworks of pure joy in glitzy song and dance routines  like the elton john it presents  it s about forgiveness  love is love is love  watching so many plume festooned costumes take wing  you re inclined to believe that hope really is the thing with feathers  director dexter fletcher s energetically emotional musical is fantastically entertaining  taron egerton  his square jaw notwithstanding  throws body and soul into this origin story about the iconic british singer performer  rocketman  is a cannily honed machine  absolutely sure of its purpose  so you rather feel you ve been sold a complete deluxe package    at times  consumer satisfaction is taken care of a little too aggressively for you to really feel involved  rocketman has unusual dramatic heft for a jukebox musical  but that s a big curve on which to grade   the characters are still skin deep  rocketman never quite finds the wild momentum its characters seem to chase around in all those musical numbers  fletcher is one of the few directors working today who really knows how to stage this sort of lavish musical number for the camera  the biopic about gay rock icon elton john is proudly queer  packed with spectacle  and though streaked with trauma and tragedy radiant with joy  if you need somebody to recount the rise of a british rock god from pallid suburbia to the baroque extremes of fame  and to create a stir without causing too much of a fuss  fletcher is your man  
1921,uncut_gems,invites such total immersion in one corner of new york that the picture takes on an anthropological flavour  there is nothing polite about brothers benny safdie and josh safdie s newest hyper adrenalized ticking clock drama uncut gems  
1922,amazing_grace_2018,the work as it stands now has considerable merit as a document recorded during a watershed period of the american civil rights movement  as a concert film  it s elevated by franklin s powerhouse three octave range and soulful phrasing  this musical feast was filmed a very long time ago   but it feels like only yesterday  it s a perfect marriage of faith and showbiz  dignified by the fact that there s nothing ersatz about it  at its heart is an unfeigned exuberance  together with a sense of history  which informs the tears  laughter and fervent expressions of belief  87 minutes of pure joy  when a parishioner leaps to her feet  her spirit clearly moved  you ll want to do the same  wholy holy indeed  i felt wrung out at the end of this film  how incredible must it have been for those who were there in person  this is a film that revels in a titanic talent  and the details that an audio recording can never pick up  the close ups are wonderfully intimate  if amazing grace can t fathom the inner depths of aretha in any definitive way  it grants her a great deal more than a little respect  glimpsed away from the mic  she sweeps past the camera with a mona lisa smile and no small talk  between songs she again smiles and says nothing  that silence a story  her choice to be simply a vessel  not a star  provides the authors of online listicles a permanent starting point when considering the 10 greatest concert films of all time  surely the new gold standard of filmed music concerts  sydney pollack s unfinished documentary  unearthed and reassembled after nearly 50 years  is a priceless gift to music fans  
1923,they_shall_not_grow_old,for the first time  those jittery  frenetic figures in ancient newsreels look and move like people you know  in this profound documentary event  peter jackson creates digital miracles in 3d yet to revitalize archival footage of world war i until faded history comes to vivid  vital life  you won t believe your eyes  
1924,ash_is_purest_white,an intimate story of romance  betrayal and loss gets framed against the sweeping  epic backdrop of radical  socio economic changes in china  engrossing  surprising and affecting  held together by a towering performance from tao   her gaze alone should carry a licence to kill  hits its stride somewhere in the middle  bounding confidently towards its hopeless  poetic conclusion  qiao scams philandering men  seemingly driven by the desire to punish bin  and yet the film  slowly  reveals more melancholic aims  guiding a low key finale towards a mournful evocation of what china has lost on the way towards modernisation  above all things  this is a film about the impossibility of love  it s when harry met sally played out on a thorny landscape with a thornier ending  mesmerisingly played by jia s regular star zhao tao  qiao is not just one woman  but passes through multiple guises  fascinating in its balance between microcosm and aerial view  but the performances definitely raise more emotional heat  despite its sprawling  two decade timeline and big budget  ash is purest white is far more than a greatest hits compilation for jia as he thankfully returns to his strengths after the transcontinental excess of mountains may depart  jia s minimalist visual style and sprawling narrative style allows him to observe changes in the present and over periods of time  do not be gulled by the slow pace of jia s stories  they are ceaselessly alive to his country s haste  as it rushes to erase and to construct  and his sympathies tilt to those uncertain souls who simply can t keep up  this is not the sort of movie that offers up immediate gratifications  though there are some of those  instead  it moves along with a steady grace  its ruminative power creeps up on you  
1925,honeyland,both laconic and poignant  honeyland alternates between stark and austere landscapes with detours into an intimate look at two families who are struggling to literally live their lives  
1926,john_wick_chapter_3_parabellum,the script  series creator derek kolstad leads the writing team  is excellent  especially when regular characters such anjelica huston s ruska roma boss and laurence fishburne s bowery king return to beef up the dialogue  reeves and dacascos s brutal  climactic sparring session definitely leaves us wanting more  not to mention wondering about a potential oscars sound editing category for shattering glass  
1927,honey_boy,the film delicately bears its scars and finds peace by acknowledging how childhood pains can make and break us  
1928,fighting_with_my_family,it is far more gripping than its subject matter might suggest  
1929,the_peanut_butter_falcon,as calculated as the film might be  it s hard to dislike  and while nilson and schwartz use gottsagen s sincerity as a guarantee of their own good intentions  this never feels as exploitative as it might have  perhaps against the odds  this shambling buddy movie really works  like a disney family drama from tv times past  this feelgood road movie is so homely  so warm and fuzzy  and so darn wholesome that it s almost too much  labeouf is scruffily compelling  while the pinpoint comic timing of gottsagen should be a lesson to any drab corners of the film industry still resisting disabled actors  this is labeouf at his best  stripped down to his bare elements and bookended by two luminous performances from gottsagen and johnson  this may have as much to do with the colorful eastern seaboard settings as it does the filmmakers  sensitive handling of the main character s developmental disability  the film feels authentic as well as sincere  the peanut butter falcon is a distinctly american fable of resilience and perseverance that s nothing less than wonderful  this marvelous riverboat journey one i am not soon to forget  labeouf s dangerous  rough hewn charm gives tyler a compelling edge  he remains one of the most commanding actors of his generation  and he s reason enough to buy into the tale  writer directors tyler nilson and michael schwartz team up to bring you what is quite possibly the feel good movie of the year  for good and ill  we can see the full picture clearly  too   so much so  finally  that this easygoing odyssey offers no real surprises  
1930,one_cut_of_the_dead,ueda    manages to reinvigorate two of the most tired tropes cluttering our media landscape  art as meta commentary on art  and explosive diarrhea  one cut of the dead isn t just charming  it s an earnest and funny love letter to all the microbudget dreamers who use all their heart and ingenuity to make their movie  you have to want to invest in his characters in order for one cut of the dead to really take off  shinichiro ueda s zombie comedy is one that purposefully pretends to offer familiar zombie schlock only to rip the rug out from under us in an innovative  hilarious way  the level of detail is uncanny  and the comedy is equally matched by charm  a genuinely clever and loving tribute to cinema at its most homemade  for a movie about the undead  japanese director shin ichir  ueda s horror comedy is certainly lively  ueda s film goes on to indulge  its  curiosity in endless head spinningly clever ways   turning a riotous genre treat into a full hearted love letter to both filmmaking and film watching alike   it s  a refreshingly earnest film  with memorable characters and an unexpectedly sweet subplot that sees a father reconnecting with his teenage daughter over their shared love of horror movies  opens with an unbroken 37 minute shot of monster mayhem before hitting the reset button and turning into a funny satire of low budget genre filmmaking   and eventually becoming a charming family comedy drama  
1931,captain_marvel,lacking a unifying vision and a charismatic star performance  this film is less a big screen comic than a patchwork quilt  captain marvel is a film you should be proud to let your children watch  it will inspire them to understand there should be no limits on what women can achieve a hugely enjoyable  funny and masterfully put together offering from marvel and disney  the problem is with the corporate anticulture that controls these productions and the fandom targeted demagogy that they re made to fulfill which responsible casting can t overcome alone  given the unholy mess of carol s continuity  the film s multi authored script makes a fair fist of delivering fragments of backstory as recovered memory  the main strength is a core of female friendship  carol danvers is the only marvel hero you could imagine getting hammered and belting out songs by no doubt  as a parent  i wish a film like this had been made when my daughter was young  in captain marvel  brie larson plays a woman who comes to learn that the most important power she possesses has been inside her all along a perfectly fine marvel installment that i can t fathom deeply loving or hating  although i m sure many viewers will manage to do both  the film may be about women breaking their shackles  but the lead actress feels kept in check for much of the picture  humor winds up being provided by samuel jackson s nick fury  heart by lashana lynch s maria rambeau  and pathos by   well  it ain t larson 
1932,knock_down_the_house,i got the impression that they have more practical ideas than we heard  and if so then lears  tearjerker sold them rather short  
1933,birds_of_passage_2019,a beguiling fa ade masks a rather commonplace gangster narrative  
1934,for_sama,you leave understanding why for al kateab the past is something she wants to live with every day  
1935,maiden,an all women crew knocked the sexist world on its ass by winning this 1989 yacht race  this dazzling doc from director alex holmes proves these female pioneers are still a cause for celebration  
1936,hustlers_2019,so here come words we weren t necessarily expecting to write   give jennifer lopez the freaking academy award for best supporting actress right now  
1937,atlantics,i really enjoyed trying to puzzle through this and i was very impressed by the tonal balance that mati diop pulls off here  
1938,one_child_nation,grand atrocities pile atop private heartbreak as this powerful film unfolds  this sort of film calls for bracing yourself and keeping your eyes open  funny how many of those there are these days  more horrifying than any screamer you ll see this year  
1939,3_faces,provocative without being hectoring  
1940,how_to_train_your_dragon_the_hidden_world,what the movie lacks in narrative flow  it makes up for in action scenes and character appeal  these dragons are rendered so expressively  and they have become so dear  we may not deserve them  but that doesn t stop the heart from wanting  
1941,woman_at_war,this quirky icelandic language dramedy about an unassuming choir conductor from reykjavik turned notorious eco terrorist has a prodigious go for broke central performance from halldora geirharosdottir  
1942,first_love_2019,k ji end  s thundering jazz rock score amplifies miike s tendency towards playful cartoon excess  
1943,chained_for_life_2018,schimberg creates a melodrama that reflects on the terms of melodrama while also pointing toward a grass roots cinematic revolution movies made by people about their own experiences  
1944,white_riot,an excellent brief documentary about a heroic grassroots political movement whose importance reveals itself more clearly in retrospect with every year that passes  
1945,the_chambermaid,how the film counters its protagonist s ambitions makes for an alternately bleak and reverent experience  leaving us with an understanding of what  women s work  really means  this is brilliantly confident film making  this wry  delicately austere debut from mexican theatre director lila avil s goes one step further  to quote a famous tv sitcom line   i don t speak maid   with avil s s help  we re taught a new language  no trace of the literary or theatrical remains in avil s s long takes and snatched  blank dialogue  the picture wraps a whole world around us  an eerily atmospheric  poignant  disquieting movie about 21st century luxury and the invisible servant class required to maintain it  avil s s disconcerting film takes us from the starched suites to the service lifts  laundries and back corridors hidden from view  maybe lacks for a killer blow  but avile s and star gabriela cartol are worth keeping an eye on  measured in its pacing but never stagnant  the chambermaid quietly fleshes out eve s subconscious with actions rather than words  a painfully astute observational drama  after you ve seen it  the world looks different  eve is one of the most fully and forcefully crafted characters i have seen on screen in some time  the chambermaid s quietness  subtlety and modesty of style always keep it dramatically engaging  
1946,transit_2018,once transit s bitterly ironic vision takes hold  it eats into the mind  an audacious reminder that there s more than one way to adapt a so called  period  novel for a new era  christian petzold s white hot existentialist noir transit is perhaps the best world war ii film since paul verhoeven s black book  even if it hinges on a suspension of disbelief that ll be too far a stretch for some  it doesn t always click  a scene involving a suicidal dog minder is a bit arch   but the dauntless ambition is never in doubt  while the voltage of the film starts sputtering out  there s still value to petzold s ideas  and on a scene to scene basis he s capable of back pocket inspiration like few others  the strangeness of this story will live in your bloodstream like a virus  atmospherically the film resembles camus s the plague without camus  stasis and rumination in a sun bleached mediterranean port  with so many layers to unpack  this one stays with you  if the minimalism of robert bresson and the hopeless romance of  casablanca  are touchpoints  they echo only faintly  transit  is a multi layered and intelligent thriller from a director who masters every move he makes  christian petzold is a gifted director   but here he mistakes narrative complexity for dramatic rigour  the film didn t need the existential ponderings  the cake was rich enough without the icing  transit is a brilliant and timely film that reminds us that we may all be currently in hell  and regret the folly of our lives  but perhaps we have each other  to a world gone mad  it s a whispered call to compassion  yet its message comes across loud and clear  transit becomes more disconcerting because of its tight grip on realism  more memorable because of its use of the absurd to highlight the ease with which fascism operates  
1947,tigers_are_not_afraid,call it bu uel meets blumhouse  a film that is flawed but so full of ideas that it doesn t matter  unsentimental resilience makes storytelling both a weapon and a shield for the orphaned children in issa l pez s blend of horror and magical realism it conveys the sense of destruction that s come with all the narco trafficking  but it also has this really beautiful fantasy element that s woven throughout  it may puzzle horror fans who hope it represents the arrival of a new genre star  that hasn t stopped auteurs like del toro  neil gaiman and stephen king from pointing fans in the film s direction   nor should it  tigers are not afraid is at its most effective when it uses its fertile imagination to terrify   a  nervy and imaginative piece of filmmaking that  on a scene by scene basis  has trouble living up to its obvious ambition  issa l pez s poetically haunting fairy tale tigers are not afraid  vuelven  addresses mexico s ongoing drug related violence with an unblinking brand of social realism  while del toro puts his characters into historical conflicts  l pez is right at home spinning a modern day fairytale that directly addresses the cost of daily violence  thematically underdeveloped yet pleasingly creepy   tigers are not afraid  balances its mild terrors with appealing moments of childish creativity  it never resolves its commingling of the fanciful and the mundane into a particularly coherent argument about the legacy of trauma  
1948,stan_and_ollie,a delightful tribute to twin phenomena so burned into collective consciousness that we need to be reminded they once didn t exist  
1949,ready_or_not_2019,weaving comes alive as a hilarious and deeply macabre play on the  final girl  archetype  and it s nothing short of cathartic to cheer her on and echo the rage that quickly consumes and empowers her  it s wildly entertaining and at a tight 90 minutes  it crackles with energy  never letting your attention waver  even by its own humble standards the plot is poorly worked out  a few lame attempts at social commentary criticising the rich are feeble in the extreme  and the dialogue is wretched  laugh out loud moments with slight revulsion   rather than running out of steam  it keeps picking up pace and cracking along   a  delicious romp with a game heroine that never takes itself too seriously  and has some pointed things to say about the class system  there s little nuance in matt bettinelli olpin and tyler gillett s horror comedy take on class warfare  but it s weaving s touch of pure anger that makes it feel like more than just your average shlocky gorefest  no fat fun and a great new scream queen in samara weaving  it s so good i wish it were better  this new offering in the hide and seek horror genre rests on a foundation of class warfare and achieves a deft balance between gruesome horror and black comedy   weaving is  vulnerable  deadpan funny  scared and resolute  turning a role that could have been one dimensional into something vibrant and authentic  what a decadent blast to watch a comic takedown of the rich done with the rude energy of a horror thriller and the courage of its own manic anti marriage convictions  the real fun comes from the ways it subverts its time tested story  balancing wry commentary and straightforward horror in its portrait of fumbling arrogance and curdled privilege  
1950,midnight_traveler,shot entirely on iphones  the afghan director s charming and moving documentary charts his three year flight with his young family from tajikistan  where they had failed to find asylum  3 500 miles to the west  balancing rough edge verit  with highly composed images and a meticulous structure  it doesn t preclude itself from finding something like poetry in its subjects  struggles  
1951,mickey_and_the_bear,through these complicated dynamics  morrone navigates her character s many highs and lows with a touching sense of authenticity  an almost perfectly realized drama that feels as if it was time warped in from 40 or 50 years ago  when people still wanted to see movies about people living in the actual world  
1952,deadwood_the_movie,some things are better left undone  
1953,varda_by_agnes,the late documentarian s final work is a literal master class  a filmed lecture during which she rambles enjoyably through her greatest hits  it gets a little less sexy towards the end as she ruminates on her love affair with still photography and the essence of truth in the captured image  but overall this is an essential and heart warming portrait of a sorely missed talent  a gorgeous trip down memory lane and an impeccably presented primer   one that very much smacks of the official version  
1954,hail_satan,satan hasn t looked this appealing since john milton s romantic write up in paradise lost  it s impressive how rarely you feel as if you re watching different movies  
1955,scream_queen_my_nightmare_on_elm_street,perhaps the slickly made documentary overstates the cultural impact of a little seen and widely disliked film  however  it earns points for scraping at the surface of something rarely discussed in film fandom   homosexuality in horror  there are interviews with academics and drag queens and fans of the horror genre  and this gives the movie a wide ranging perspective that helps us better understand the moving personal story at its core  there s a radiant humanity to this horror doc that takes it from fascinating fun to truly stupendous  
1956,the_heiresses,a really well acted character study  this unshowy camerawork and natural performances make the heiresses feel realistic  this subtle  beautifully acted and in many ways remarkable debut is an exciting discovery from an unexpected source  it s a small story  but the points it makes about the corrosion wrought by class distinctions and the prejudices attached to them give it a dimension that will resonate wherever you happen to live  but if some questions remain unanswered  brun s performance provides much of the clarity we need  by the end of the film  the audience feels like it knows his heroine at almost precisely the same time she has gotten to know herself  it s a minor kind of magic   the heiresses  almost subliminally alerts you to complexities of sexuality and status that many films would prefer to simplify  it also draws you into a social milieu that is both highly specific and intuitively accessible  the entire movie feels muddled  especially in its effort to fashion a gets her groove back narrative from financial ruin  the acting throughout is strong  and brun is terrific  it s a performance of tragicomic genius that plays out in arched eyebrows and stabbing side eye swipes at other women  this is definitely the best film about an ageing paraguayan lesbian couple you ll see this year  it s also one of the best films of any sort you ll see  a haunting story with a rich sense of character and place  through stillness  the smallest arch of an eyebrow and shift of an eye  brun brilliantly conveys the disorientation of a woman who has always relied on others to service her needs and whims  martinessi shrewdly combines subtlety  melancholy  satirical observation and candour about sex  the heiresses is a tickling  near perfect tragicomedy from paraguay  the nuances are so fine you could slip them between adjacent atoms  
1957,toni_morrison_the_pieces_i_am,the program is a must see for any student of literature and anyone curious about her work  and the world from which she emerged  whether you have read everything she wrote or have never ventured into her worlds  it s likely that the first thing you ll do when you leave the cinema is pick up one of her novels  greenfield sanders s film is not as structurally daring as its subject  but it makes great use of archive and text alongside its talking heads  a celebratory portrait of author toni morrison painted by those who knew her  this compelling documentary also explores how her work gives such a powerful voice to the african american experience   toni  morrison remains an inspiration for many reasons  but especially because she believed in her own talents long before the institutional arbiters of such things caught on to them   w hen it s over  you feel like a beloved friend has left the room  vigorous and forever fierce  and sporting a range of talents so impressive as to be virtually incomprehensible to us lesser creatives and activists who nonetheless seek our own artistic destinies  toni morrison  the pieces i am is required viewing  as with morrison s books  the pieces i am invites multiple  maybe even piecemeal  encores  because few writers wield the capacity to leave their readers with an evolving parting message with each subsequent reread  it s like attending office hours for the professor you love and fear  while the format as such doesn t allow for a critical push and pull  that s not a debit  this is about time well spent on a life well lived  a series of pieces adding up to much more than the whole  
1958,the_last_black_man_in_san_francisco,it s less of a rallying cry against gentrification than a rumination on the kind of pained acceptance those who suffer its effects must face  while talbot and fails avoid turning their homespun homesick story into an unwieldy and self important metaphor for black american experience in total  creeping bloat makes itself felt elsewhere  
1959,midsommar,after a while  an unproductive restlessness sets in as you wait for the characters to matter as much as the silky moves and painstaking details  horror indeed  it s cultural sensitivity that lies at the heart of this movie  it is not about serial killers  aliens or supernatural beings  it is about the ordinary humans we know as the other because they come from somewhere else  ari aster s approach to horror filmmaking seeps into your subconsciousness with great effect  lingering like an uninvited guest  even more than hereditary  midsommar lives on the edge where horror meets absurdity  prompting the kind of laughter that comes from not knowing how else to respond  midsommar mostly takes place in sweden  but at its core is a particularly american sense of rootlessness  florence pugh carries the movie  and her wryly matter of fact commitment to the character s tenuous subjectivity is what allows aster s storytelling to vacillate between blistering satire  broken in psychological realism  and straight faced ominousness   this  thriller was one descent into sunshine filled pagan madness i could have done without  as the film sways drunkenly towards its inevitable conclusion  aster fails to conjure a sense of dread or even tension   essential qualities of the horror genre  grim  grisly and downright sickening  midsommar is a feel bad horror film about suicide  mercy killings  insanity  graphic nudity  religious hysteria  and the kind of grotesque imagery that exists for no other reason than shock value  with her scared eyes  alert line readings and lillian gish looks  miss pugh  late of lady macbeth  ensures it is much better than it might have been anyway  don t let the studio manufactured hype fool you  this is a midsummer s matinee bore  midsommar has that sort of staying power  which makes it a better choice for horror aficionados than the other midsummer garbage currently being dumped into theaters  it s a world that you absolutely believe in  aided by really really brilliant performances  
1960,the_mustang,animals have been coaxing the soft side out of tough guys since clint eastwood co starred with an orangutan  yet there s still something poignant about this meathead engaging with a warmer world  manages to be inspirational without going disney  
1961,wild_rose_2019,buckley s unusually unguarded expressions give viewers entry into her character s every thought  buckley has bags of pugnacious charisma and a soaring  throaty singing voice tempered with enough vulnerability to make us want to hold her close even as the screw up she offers us drives everyone in her orbit up the wall  
1962,blinded_by_the_light,most of the film s emotional weight is undermined by cheesy sing alongs with the lyrics visualized in such a garish way that the supposed thematic significance bashes the audience in the head  the film feels authentic in its depiction both of javed s family but also the changes that took place after what seems to have been akin to a religious conversion  the deliberately amateurish style of the musical numbers is supposed to engender spontaneity but too often looks merely cack handed  nonetheless  you come out on a high  springsteen fever proves to be contagious  while it s far from perfect  on balance  it s an inoffensive  feel good and inspirational british dramedy with some charming performances and an emotionally affecting story about an immigrant teenager and how he finds salvation in springsteen s music  if you re seeking a cutesy movie with some recognizable songs  this will do  it is almost as if the movie s more noticeable imperfections only end up making the feature as a whole even more infectiously intoxicating  even when it feels as if we ve seen this movie before  we ve never seen it set to the sounds of the boss  and we ve never seen it from the point of view of this particular terrific kid and his family  watching the teenage javed become his own man is the best time i ve had at the movies this year  while nothing that happens is surprising  nearly all of it is performed with soulfulness and conviction and charm  these songs have the power to move  inspire  make you dance  for the first time in my experience of springsteen  they made me want to hide under my seat  
1963,bad_education_2019,jackman does a magnificent job of portraying a man who has been lying so long on so many fronts  even he isn t sure of the truth any longer  a career best hugh jackman and allison janney shine as new york school administrators who stole millions from their long island district  cory finley s steadily riveting provocation jabs at the culture of money that makes us all complicit  
1964,ad_astra,in a world in which star wars movies still rule the roost  it s encouraging to find an  80m space based movie setting its artistic sights on the stars rather than simply recycling intergalactic horse opera cliches  gray is such an exquisite cinematic craftsman it s unlikely i could have torn my eyes away from the screen even if i had wanted to try and do so  gray has a gift for shrinking massive set pieces and enlarging private dramas  
1965,63_up,there s great pleasure in revisiting this series  seeing who turned out just fine and sometimes better than you might have expected or hoped  
1966,homecoming_a_film_by_beyonce,this revelatory  incredible  inspiring documentary gives you both a front row pass to watch every hit song and backstage access to see how its musical  logistical and philosophical foundations all came together in perfect harmony  
1967,too_late_to_die_young,castillo s talent for spiritually attuned atmospherics could be her usp among chile s current crop of directors with idiosyncratic slants on their country s recent past  
1968,gloria_bell,a well observed  good character study  although something that you may have seen before  the result isn t better than the 2013 original but it s just as good  moore s subtle  empathetic work elevates what could be dismissed as a small scale  even banal story  whether she s dealing with conflicts at work  doing laugh therapy sessions  or smoking weed on the floor of her apartment while the californian sunlight slants through the window  this is a bell that chimes  there are low moments  flat moments and unconvincing moments   but gloria deserves to be protected at all costs  despite failing to replicate the authenticity of the original  gloria bell offers just the right amount of angst and drama to be able to stand on its own feet  there is a terrific performance here from moore  and an equally good one from turturro  who may be entering into his own golden years of bittersweet character work  stunningly acted and sensitively detailed  it s a modest story of a normal  middle aged life told with compelling honesty  gloria bell smashes the bechdel test  and that s mostly because filmmaker sebasti n lelio just lets these scenes of everyday life unfold  and lets julianne moore react in them    masterfully so  there is a kind of daring in the film s very modesty  in lelio s decision to forego the thrills of melodrama and the lure of glamour to follow an unexceptional woman through the peaks and valleys of her days  
1969,by_the_grace_of_god_2019,ozon was wise to translate the story into fiction  in their rawness and their sense of intimacy  the family scenes ferret out the emotional truths behind the bald and bitter facts  overall  francois ozon has given us a story that is both compassionate and honest  he has also managed to pepper it thought with moments of disarming tenderness  a truly heartening and devastating account  ozon is not someone you would normally expect to eschew his usual gothic to make public service announcements in the manner of this film  but what it shares with his other works is a deep understanding of the way trauma endures in the world  there s perhaps an over reliance on voiceover by way of letters and emails  though the film s unvarnished formal directness is a good thing  given the sensitive material  ozon s approach is masterful  his past proclivities for mischief making nowhere to be seen  what makes the portrait of preynat so effective is that while he s a monster  you also see how this guy won the confidence and respect of parents and parishioners  how he groomed not only children but a whole community  if there were ever any doubt that ozon  that impish provocateur  was the man to handle it  the career topping urgency of his filmmaking sweeps it away inch by inch  sequence by methodical sequence  ozon has made a decent and valuable film  though it often seems like the drama part of a docudrama  some of the scenes feel like respectful re enactments that could have gone into a documentary  a worthy clump through a true story worthy of our attention  to approach the grim subject matter  ozon forgoes his trademark satirical wit and flamboyant style  
1970,midnight_family,mexico city has fewer than 45 official ambulances serving nine million people    luke lorentzen s adrenalised documentary focuses on one of the private teams that fill the gap  packed with tense moments and disturbing shots that  without compromising the clients  privacy  hint at the unhappiness just offscreen  were it not for the real tragedy and horror involved  this documentary could almost be filed under the bleakest and often hilarious kind of black comedy  at 81 minutes  you won t be bored  but don t be surprised if the car ride home finds you questioning how an audition reel for a reality television program earned a theatrical release  there s something vaguely outlandish about the way they speed through the streets    yet there s also a strong moral core  like juan yelling at a junkie whose glue sniffing antics leave his kid in a coma  what s indelible in this visceral chronicle is that more than profiting from human suffering  the ochoas fill the gaps of economic inequality while doing good without reservation  periodically while watching  midnight family  you feel as if you can t look at the screen for another second  but you can t look away either  these moments of downtime provide a warm  comic energy to midnight family that renders the ochoas naturally sympathetic subjects and illustrates why lorentzen decided to film them in the first place  an intriguing perspective on health care in urban mexico  profound and thrilling cinema verit  filmmaking  
1971,bunuel_in_the_labyrinth_of_the_turtles,with its dust and sherry toned colour palette and starkly angular character design  it will intrigue animation fans  an engaging if somewhat demure animation  bordering occasionally on a kind of gentle sentimentality that is inimical to the subject    this speedy portrait of the surrealist as a young man has its own discreet charms  there s something admirable about a film so confidently made to fit into a niche  the 2d animated rendering of the master filmmaker is more graphic interpretation than faithful portrait  perfect to cruise between reality and the anxiety fueled nightmares that besiege his sleep  at its most absorbing   bu uel in the labyrinth of the turtles  makes it clear there are no easy answers  perhaps especially when the art itself isn t easy  bunuel is above all a good story elegantly told  transcending its obviously niche appeal and showing that spanish animation  following last year s multiple award winning another day of life  is looking healthy  
1972,fiddler_a_miracle_of_miracles,the clip of the temptations singing a cover of if i were a rich man is worth the price of admission alone  what makes it brilliant is that it demonstrates how universal this distinctly jewish musical has become  how it has been embraced by many cultures and how it is still influential today  there s considerable pleasure to be had here  particularly in the interweaving of several decades  performance clips in various staging styles and languages   t his engaging and enlightening documentary is stuffed with anecdotes  history and information  it makes excellent use of both new interviews and carefully selected archival footage to reveal the building blocks of all this accomplishment  toes will tap  a tear or two might be shed   a complex story about a deceivingly complex musical is adoringly told and ultimately simplified  an exhaustive  emotional testament to the musical s staying power as popular entertainment and its extraordinary thematic reach  
1973,american_factory,could not have been more timely  
1974,dirty_god,an intimate portrait of a restless young woman seeking mind  body and soul comfort  newcomer vicky knight is magnetic and there are flashes of kinetic brilliance despite sketchy stretches  dirty god is a film about finding your own path  of the necessity of trial and error  and a timely reminder that the fallout of domestic violence for its survivors is not just difficult  but often very  very messy  an astonishingly vibrant and engaging performance by feature first timer vicky knight drives this urgent  passionate drama from dutch film maker sacha polak  the struggles of a severely scarred acid attack victim in a looks obsessed world are taken to unexpected places by the director sacha polak  in a frank but sensitive way   sacha  polak delves into areas that most other filmmakers would be far too timid to go near  both a sharply observed character study and a damning indictment of our skin deep instagram culture  a grounded story of human resilience that can t help but move you  boasts a stand out performance from newcomer vicky knight and an unflinching portrait of a strong willed yet immature protagonist facing a radical change in how the world looks at her as well as how she sees herself  there s enough visual brio and emotional authenticity for knight to bring it home  
1975,making_waves_the_art_of_cinematic_sound,celebrating the magic of cinema as much as it explains it  making waves will have cinephiles listening to their favourite movies with fresh ears  the blend of historical overview  film clips  tech info  and inside business on offer is pretty irresistible  midge costin s marvellous documentary opens our eyes to a subtle art typically dismissed as the boring  loo break  category of movie awards ceremonies  if it feels like a feelgood in house promotional video for hollywood technicians     well  they ve got an awful lot to feel good about  a practically perfect primer for anyone interested in the history and craft of filmmaking  answering most of the pertinent  baseline questions while leaving plenty of room for supplemental research  those who make the effort to see this fascinating film will feel their time has been equally well spent  making waves will likely inspire viewers to seek out their favorite films and experience them with fresh ears  
1976,im_no_longer_here,an uneven but original take on immigrant displacement  
1977,working_woman,ben shlush is excellent as orna  while noy exudes faded charm as the boss who treats his female employees shamefully  although commendably relatable  the story line at times feels too familiar  save for later scenes in which orna makes some choices that lead to a  mostly  satisfying ending   working woman  sends an audience out steaming that justice in such cases often remains undone  an understated polemic that becomes an affecting drama  feels very contemporary  but will also resonate with generations of viewers who recognize the many small moments that lead up to and follow its quietly wrenching central experience  finely drawn characters and the kind of grey area scenario that may be uncomfortably familiar to many women make this a thought provoking addition to the post  metoo conversation  aviad and his co writers manage a resolution that is satisfying without stretching credibility  or taking the film into revenge fantasy schematics  
1978,the_cave_2019,manipulations in post production slightly undermine material that is already dramatic enough  
1979,the_kingmaker,it s grimly compelling viewing as marcos gives filmmaker lauren greenfield intimate access to her opulent life and oblivious narcissism  while the film starts in wry fly on the wall mode  it morphs into something weightier and surreally unsettling   louis theroux to luis bu uel in 60 minutes flat  
1980,harpoon_2019,the energetic mix of mayhem and snark will appeal to those who like their comedy horrific and their horror comedic  a lean  mean thriller with pitch black humor pumping through its veins  this is one boat ride worth taking  the increasingly preposterous plot twists might have been an issue  but  as the dripping sarcasm in the narration is at pains to stress  this is not a film which takes itself remotely seriously  
1981,love_antosha,though clearly an adoring tribute  love  antosha allows its subject a sort of complicated humanity that expands our understanding of him  the title is how the immigrant s child closed his frequent and heartfelt letters to his fiercely devoted mother irina  and the film plays a bit like her loving reply  a tribute to the son whose grave she still visits daily  price has given us yelchin s most complete performance  himself  it is a cinematic gift to contemporary film fans everywhere  yelchin was fighting to fill every waking moment with art  making it and absorbing it  and his many journal entries  narrated by nicolas cage  giving one of his best performances in many years  reveal great insight and emotional depth  understandably a document of what was lost  but it also serves as a reminder of the impact one can have even in such a comparatively small window of time  a touching and surprising portrait of an actor who had much more going on in his life   from a serious illness to some seriously left field artistic inclinations   than was mentioned in his obituaries  a rich reminiscence of a gifted actor who died far too young  
1982,i_lost_my_body,a gloriously hand animated existential fable that manages to be both genuinely sweet and thoroughly twisted  until i watched i lost my body  i never thought i d sit with bated breath  rooting for a severed hand o defy the laws of physics and hurl itself up a ladder rung by rung  dan levy s mesmerising score  a stellar voice cast  and an unconventional denouement ensure that this is the best animated feature film of 2019  if it s slightly hampered by a generic love story and pie in the sky teenage pontificating  i lost my body should still rank among the year s most original and peculiar films  hands down  anyone who s willing to meet this movie on its own terms and roll with the dream logic it requires will be rewarded with a resonantly cathartic saga  a visually sumptuous slice of macabre storytelling that works best when it uses its director s magical sense of composition and less when it feels weighed down by narrative  had clapin and laurant succeeded in fusing those two wildly disparate storylines    i lost my body might have been more than a mildly intriguing  visually dynamic curiosity  it focuses equally on moments of shared connection and incidental loss until the two feel indistinguishable  a highly original and rather touching account of loss  both physical and emotional  this is the kind of mature animation flick that could find traction beyond the fest circuit  
1983,jojo_rabbit,a pointless hitler spoofy ya adventure with a 12a certificate  obtusely accentuating little kid cuteness and optimism amid the quaintly imagined non horror  
1984,little_woods,the directorial debut by nia dacosta is a stunning  deep and thoughtful portrait of two marginalised women in america forgotten by city folk and the political class  it s the kind of scenario we ve often seen on screen  but the ambience is new and precisely evoked as a world of cruel contrasts  if this is  dacosta s  starting line  imagine what she ll be able to do once she hits her stride   dacosta  intuitively reveals a deeper dimension to both of her heroines by taking an extra beat at the beginning or end of scenes to observe their faces when no one else is watching  with a confident eye and economy of storytelling  dacosta crafts a fiercely feminist and sensitive family portrait if little woods had trusted its two leading ladies just a little bit more  it could have been a truly great movie  as is  it s a very good one that is worth seeing mostly for its cast  a modest but intensely empathetic first film by writer director nia dacosta  tessa thompson emotionally expands  little woods   turning a small movie into something more than its textured parts  the film fails to provoke a strong emotion from the audience other than a heavy sense of hopelessness  but that s also what makes it so interesting  it doesn t bother to coddle  featuring a dynamite turn from tessa thompson as a parolee looking for one last opiod score before going straight  nia dacosta s uneven but compelling drama tells you what s it like living down and out in the usa  dacosta has made a suspense film in which we root for the heroes to break the law  and then she sends us home to ponder all the reasons they need to  those willing to endure the film s discomforts will come away having witnessed as powerful and essential a depiction of familial love as they are likely to see this year  just when you think you know where it s going  it subverts the genre  telling an old story from a new  unexpected perspective  
1985,dark_waters_2019,dark waters is as gripping as it is terrifying  and it ll claw into your consciousness in the same way that poisonous forever chemicals have claimed squatter s rights in your body     by focusing on the individuals involved  and laying out a compelling moral vision  dark waters also works as a powerful metaphor for those cases when persistence and compassion have pushed society forward  the subject deserved better  in dark waters   todd haynes  bathes his audience in pure terror like very few other directors could  haynes presents a sedate yet immeasurably precise court room drama  which seems far less concerned with the minutiae of the story itself than with billot s own redemptive arc the bilotts make compelling viewing  straight arrows losing the scales from their eyes  already depressed that modern life is killing us all  prepare not to be cheered up  a bizarrely strait laced project for todd haynes  dark waters lacks dramatic oomph but compensates via a well mounted telling of a terrifying story  driven by still contemporary concerns and a convincing central turn by mark ruffalo  ruffalo and haynes have stripped away a significant proportion of what makes their work distinctive in what looks like a mistaken opinion that style is not serious  bilott s story is a serious one and demands a responsible retelling  fortunately  haynes finds a way to do so without mistaking such a weighty task as an excuse to be plodding or bone dry procedural  it s enough to make you want to chuck all of your non stick and waterproofed products after seeing this movie  
1986,the_two_popes,there isn t anything in the bleeding heart positions espoused by jorge bergoglio that complicates pope francis s public persona  
1987,mike_wallace_is_here,worth seeing if you re interested in journalists  watching people give an interview   there are some really juicy and interesting clips regarding freedom of the press    this film does not offer any actual conclusions  but it is an atmospheric immersion in the old  smoky and very male world of american tv journalism  a little more air might have been welcome  but this remains a hugely entertaining film for anyone interested in the american way of communicating  a solid piece of cultural investigation built around a man who helped write history while it happened  belkin floats the notion that wallace s sharp tongued style paved the way for the lying loudmouths who now populate our fractured media landscape  but it feels like a half hearted bid for contemporary relevance  at least his prickishness had purpose  the film deftly weaves news and interview clips from wallace s half century on tv with the times he himself answered questions as tough as those he asked  fleshing out one of the country s last formidable journalists  watching belkin s documentary  one realizes how much better wallace was at playing mike wallace than any actor could be  mike wallace is here doesn t answer tough questions about wallace s career  was it drama  good journalism or both  what was his legacy  but avi belkin s documentary offers fascinating insights into what made its subject tick  having watched wallace since childhood i was riveted to the screen from start to finish  as a character portrait and reflection on an era  mike wallace is here is as vibrant and timely as its subject 
1988,ray_and_liz,billingham s famous photos are tough minded and emotionally painful  silent by virtue of their medium  and his live action version offers a similar experience  we often say art  cuts close to the bone   but in its depiction of clinking liquor bottles and drawers of unopened rent notices soaked in dog urine  ray   liz slices clean through that bone  with its very tamped down emotion  bellingham s decision not to attempt insight or empathy is the most telling display of the consequences of his story   a  film in which the memories you can t shake and the memories you won t let go become indistinguishable from the ones you never had  the lives we see are eked out on the breadline with an air of desperation and feverishness  yet daniel landin s cinematography captures them affectionately  all hail an instant classic  creating an astute sense of atmosphere and detail that come together to make meaning  richard billingham marks himself out as a filmmaker to watch  the film hops about in time and mood with the agility of an actual fly on an actual wall  the adult inhabitants of this human zoo may be repellent but the searing authenticity of billingham s nightmarish vision ensures we can t look away  
1989,be_natural_the_untold_story_of_alice_guy_blache,the ingrained sexism it highlights could form the basis of several sequels  it definitely piques your interest about her work  the all important films are shown in almost subliminal excerpts  offering today s audiences little opportunity to assess the place of this remarkable woman in cinema history  
1990,monos,it s clear from the start that landes is out to make a tragedy about innocence lost and the wickedness of political movements that rule by remote control with the capriciousness of greek gods  he s succeeded brilliantly  there are allusions to william golding s lord of the flies  but that fine novel  and peter brook s 1962 screen adaptation  though also elliptical  provided far more satisfying drama than landes somewhat frustrating epic    the performances from the young cast are vivid and utterly credible  yet the conspicuously metaphorical nature of the context eventually becomes wearisome  monos is one of the year s most extraordinary films  its feverish visuals rupture any sense of surface realism  creating a disarming  almost surrealist universe where anarchy takes hold  monos is bound to be a fixture on many critics  top 10 films of 2019 lists  muscular filmmaking  physically shaken  in a good way  it s an intoxicating descent into anarchy that alarmingly suggests the bonds of civility are all too easy to shuck off  monos sinks you into its mud until the dirt stuffs your mouth  you won t be able to breathe   but you ll be thanking landes for the cinematic suffocation all the same  call it a collective character study or a perpetual war film   monos takes it cues from a number of well known influences  but there s a specific  singular madness that s completely its own  
1991,shadow_2018,if the great wall felt like yimou was turning his greatest hits into something dispassionately bland  then shadow takes the familiar and makes it feel startlingly new  his latest lavish feature sees the visionary storyteller operating in a slightly subtler mode  with fewer flying bodies and more philosophical concerns  
1992,rojo_2018,dario grandinetti s riveting performance as the vaguely menacing yet bureaucratic claudio is a reminder that repulsive or unfathomable characters can be as fascinating as likable ones  the film does not serve up its ideas in easily digestible bites  the audience needs to work with a dislocated string of scenes that sometimes highlight absurdity  sometimes violence and frequently say very little at all  embrace this little masterpiece before it disappears  a disarming allegory about middle class society turning a blind eye to the excesses committed in the name of so called peace and stability  it s all about a society manoeuvring to stay at the dinner table while getting its unsavoury elements thrown out  and finding ways to stop them ever coming back  many works of art foreground the victims of corruption  fewer investigate the hearts and minds of those who turn their backs  its accessibility    could turn this into naishtat s most widely seen work to date and help consolidate his reputation as an exciting new voice in argentinean cinema  the actual outcome speaks to naishtat s resourcefulness as a storyteller  that his faux columbo fails to emerge as a hero cinches his film s deep and all too recognizably realistic cynicism  the detective plot is shaggy and never fully resolves itself  but the implications of the story resonate like a distant drum  
1993,in_fabric,i was mesmerized  few people could get away with making haunted couture seem chilling without being kitsch  or turn ridiculously verbose retail speak into something both sidesplitting and unnerving  
1994,an_elephant_sitting_still,an epitaph for an extremely promising career cut short  
1995,clemency_2019,chukwu s devastating and complex character study advances the discourse around capital punishment beyond the usual contrived talking points  
1996,the_mortuary_collection,most of all  it s the sharp banter between brown and custer that keeps it perpetually on the right side of deliciously entertaining  and strikes a very usual balance   a  horror anthology that re creates its influences with an impressively lush visual sensibility  considering its modest beginnings as a short film  the problem plaguing 90 percent of horror anthologies is that there are rotten apples tossed in the basket  not so with writer director ryan spindell s delicious quartet  
1997,the_lego_movie_2_the_second_part,if you re willing to let the quantum mechanics slide  you ll have a pretty awesome time  by this point    i think i ve had enough of the lego movies  these things can only go so far and i think they may have exceeded their natural life span  
1998,the_kid_who_would_be_king,i m a huge fan of cornish s 2011 debut attack the block  but this film isn t nearly as energetic or enjoyably wacky as its predecessor  it s not embarrassed about not being cynical  cornish is a witty and inventive director but the basic conceit here never really works  given our current level of  brexitshambles despair  it s a timely tonic to have a film extolling hope in an age when  hearts are hollow and the land is lost and leaderless   the kid who would be king is a revelation without being a relic  a throwback to a time when family films weren t overloaded with pop culture references or pop music  this scrappily engaging new take from joe cornish  squarely aimed at older children and younger teens  finds a sparkle in the old tale that feels timely and fresh  it falls short of enchanting but it s never less than fun and likable  watch it through the eyes of your inner teenager and you ll have a blast  it s a charming notion  worked out zestfully by the writer director  joe cornish  until the charm falls victim to familiar cgi halloweenery  cornish is offering a kind of movie they just don t make anymore   expansive live action adventure tales unabashedly aimed at young people  not the adults charged with taking them to the cinema  a fantasy adventure inspired by arthurian legends that  although perfectly entertaining for children in the age 8 12 bracket  may be a bore and a chore for adults  
1999,citizen_k,americans may go into  citizen k  not knowing who this rather anonymous looking man is or how to pronounce or spell his name  but they will come out totally on team khodorkovsky  
2000,one_night_in_miami,here king lets narrative ingenuity permeate each frame as she remains behind the camera  drawing us inside this circle of legends  each of whom represents distinct aspects of black identity and struggle  director regina king ignites a powderkeg by casting four dynamite actors as 1964 civil rights icons kingsley ben adir as malcolm x  eli goree as cassius clay  aldis hodge as jim brown  and an oscar worthy leslie odom jr  as sam cooke and letting them rip  
2001,portrait_of_a_lady_on_fire,even without showing men onscreen  sciamma depicts the myriad ways in which the patriarchy constricts the lives of her female protagonists  
2002,minari,its neatness may tempt you to dismiss its heartwarming quality as the packet kind  i don t think so  
2003,ma_raineys_black_bottom,the sense that we re beholden to the whims of unseen forces that we re not the protagonists of our own stories cuts deep in ma rainey s black bottom  the story concerns itself chiefly with the role of music in documenting and  in some cases  defusing the unspeakable pains that birthed the blues  acting doesn t come much bolder and more blistering than in ma rainey s black bottom  each of the actors rises to the occasion in this production  riding a wave of heat crafted by screenwriter and wilson whisperer ruben santiago hudson  ma rainey has the weight of hollywood power players behind it  but it seems incapable or uninterested in taking advantage of the delights of what film can do  like ma demanded in her time  davis claims every scene in which she s centered without dimming the performances of her co stars  as if that were possible  two searing performances by viola davis and the late chadwick boseman make this filmmore than just a faithful adaptation of a great theater piece and preserves one of august wilson s enduring works for all time  enacted by a dream cast  chadwick boseman gives a powerful performance that reverberates with pride  pain and thwarted ambition  the film occasionally suffers from the slight stiffness that often afflicts movies adapted from theater  but to watch these actors is pure pleasure    george c wolfe is mostly happy to film the play  rather than expand and dilute the material into a larger space  boseman plays levee with an electricity that feels urgent  
2004,soul_2020,it shortchanges itself at every turn by overextending itself  i feel like an ingrate as i complain about a mainstream disney release that doesn t talk down to its audience  a trojan horse of philosophizing packaged as shiny entertainment  but as much as i was intrigued by soul  i didn t actually enjoy the experience 
2005,1917_2019,the film dazzles at each step  one encounter and adventure after another shot like a set piece  complete in itself with mackay s stoic presence adding to the pathos and poignancy  the film is thrilling  moving on effectively from one shocking set piece to another  studding the narrative too with starry cameos  it s a tense  unnerving ride that accomplishes its goal of translating the first person experience of war better than any war movies that have come before it  it s a level up  for all the steel trap visceral efficiency  it s the more low key moments that really pack a punch   those moments when we re confronted with the simple human cost of war  i couldn t take my eyes off of the screen  1917 s ambitious gambit soon becomes a double edged sword  it brings us closer to these men  but sets them apart from the collective experiences it seeks to memorialise  audiences who should be absorbed by the physical challenges inherent in the soldiers  mission are likely to be thinking instead of the technical ones faced by the film makers  when it was being shot only a year ago  1917 was a phenomenal tribute to a generation almost wiped out in the trenches of world war i  at the moment of release  it has become more timely  but while it is narratively samey  with jeopardy heaped upon jeopardy  and never strays from dramatic convention   it s a race against time thriller  as well as an against all the odds one   it is also urgent and involving and we care  a slice of prestige british film making that nimbly avoids accusations of heritage cosiness  if mendes  film making has sometimes felt to have not fully outgrown his beginnings in theatre  1917 is wildly cinematic  a movie that makes you feel the breath of mortality on your neck  
2006,the_invisible_man_2020,the prize asset is moss  of course  a seven octave actor equally happy with micro emotion and going very big indeed  in their re imagined the invisible man  filmmaker leigh whannell and actress elisabeth moss attack the patriarchy and affirm rich white tech bros as the enemy  this is far removed from what you might be expecting  whannell is brilliant at distracting us with amusing  knowing dialogue  siblings are rivalrous  architects are trendy  waiters are irksomely urbane   death comes when you least expect it  moss is terrific as a woman who believes  or says she believes  her not dead husband has come back  masked by an invisibility he has created    abusers keep their victims under their thumbs  even when they re absent  that s plenty shocking on its own  and now is just the right time to be telling this story  this way  as a piece of effective entertainment with a core of instinctual horror  whannell uses stillness and empty spaces against the audience expertly  but it s moss who most sells this new  self consciously serious take on a hammy monster movie premise  while chock full of relatively good scares  campy effects and an ending that will tickle a very specific demographic of 1990s and 2000s thriller fans with glee  the invisible man doesn t deliver more than that  subverting the original text s point of view allows whannell to privilege his female protagonist while continuing to explore the novel s theme of untrammelled power  whannell has gone back to basics crafting a grounded  deeply unsettling character driven thriller  despite its lack of pretense  there are actually layers of intelligent subtext curling beneath the standard horror plot  
2007,never_rarely_sometimes_always,an enlightening script  expert ensemble acting and the most revealing film ever made about a young woman s right to choose  in the refusal to spell out or resolve too much  something lingers  first timer sidney flanigan is so believable as autumn  that you never stop feeling protective of her    i m not trying to downplay the emotional stuff  but there s a fine line between gruelling and gripping and hittman is always on the right side of it  like the grim flip side of juno  it can be a bleak watch  with no one cracking a smile for a good 45 minutes  but it s a slowly rewarding one   eliza  hittman s script fills in the blanks without resorting to anything as prosaic as straightforward exposition  with intimate and often claustrophobic close ups  hittman s characters are beautifully framed  but never too rigidly directed  a perfectly observed portrait of female friendship  a coming of age story with road movie inflections  piercingly honest and deeply affecting  never rarely sometimes always is often difficult viewing  but it offers a perspective on american womanhood that is informative  insightful  and asking for our empathy  it s not an easy watch  but never rarely sometimes always is a necessary  unflinching portrait of young women trying to do right by themselves in a world seemingly against them at every turn  never rarely sometimes always becomes a story of survival  resourcefulness  and friendship as the two girls navigate two days in the city with no place to stay and very little money  it s downright dickensian  watching  autumn s q a  unbroken  in real time    rather than seem exploitative or like a cinematic trick  feels like the only empathetic way to show it  to let her have that journey  never hints at the quiet  revolutionary nature of empathy and autonomy in empowering young women to keep themselves safe  
2008,sound_of_metal,simply put  you don t hear movies like this every day  
2009,promising_young_woman,this is lip gloss misanthropy packaged as feminist manifesto  clever but not smart  cynical without being perceptive or particularly passionate  women are angry for good reason  they also deserve better movies than this one  
2010,hamilton_2020,in a single song  renee elise goldsberry shows off a range between monica s vocals and lauryn hill s rhyme skills  goldsberry drops the most exhilarating performance i ve seen all year  the end result provides nearly three hours of superior entertainment both for those who consider themselves hamilton devotees and those without previous viewing experience  
2011,wolfwalkers,here is an animated film that finds new beauty in ancient traditions  a film that fights back against the temptation to surrender what little magic this world still has left  and fulfills cartoon saloon s promise along the way  wolfwalkers does its world building through emotional voice work  through lush  hand drawn animation  and through visual style for days  there s an ecological parable going on here  no doubt  girl power is a running theme as well  but i was most knocked out by  wolfwalkers    metaphors for the long  sad colonization   wolfwalkers  lyrically sets up a man vs  nature battle  told in grand irish storytelling that honors and respects its origins while spinning a damn good tale  the film is terrific fare for kids  but the underpinnings of its fantastical story lie in tortured irish history    adults will be eager to see where it s all going to go  wolfwalkers deserves a new level of praise for the way it takes previous cartoon saloon themes  such as the porous relationship between man and nature  to new heights of artistry  the pleasures these animators bring us hark back to plucky classics of the form    and the primitivism of the aesthetic pays charming dividends all the way through  it is the type of stirring entertainment that delivers both the thrill of the moment and the kind of sophisticated ideas that can lead to discussion and even debate long after viewing  it would be worth watching even if it were just for its beauty  but the story is very interesting  so many strands  and when the full tapestry is unfurled  its captivating  beautiful  thrilling  and entrancing patterns are revealed  wolfwalkers stands proud as a new classic   t here s nothing quite as transporting and sometimes transformative as a work of animation that devotes itself to shaking up your reality  the storyline s edges are frayed just enough to give it the gentle distance of a tale recalled though the gauze of myth and memory  
2012,palm_springs_2020,this breezy  irreverent  oddly violent and charming entry into this increasingly robust genre stands solidly on its own  
2013,da_5_bloods,from its sweeping jungle vistas to its full fat orchestral score from terence blanchard  da 5 bloods often feels like an old fashioned hollywood adventure  but reality keeps pushing its way through in ways that can t be ignored  foremost among its accomplishments is the confident ease with which it traverses many shades of human experience    lee does this by skillfully fading discrete genres into each other over the course of its two hour and 35 minute runtime  
2014,miss_juneteenth,a joyful observation of black lives  timely in this moment of global protest against racial injustice  carl jung s claim that the greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of its parents is rigorously tested  and validated  by this perfectly formed heartbreaker from the debut director channing godfrey peoples  the film buzzes with life and sincere feeling  the performances resonate like a struck bell  but a few too many questions are left unasked  the film owes most of its appeal to its ability to navigate some rather thorny post race themes under the guise of a breezy social drama  a skilful  nuanced take on a traditional survival narrative  it s a story that doesn t ignore the realities of being black in america  acknowledging deep seated issues that the country continues to grapple with  this is what i would call a thoughtful entertainment  well done and full of meaningful content  a really sweet movie  it s a little loose  but i think it really fits with the story itself  which kind of meanders its way into a kind of sweet feeling  through her round the way girl protagonist  peoples reminds turquoise and all of us that there s more than one way to get free  a warmhearted and pain streaked melodrama that s deeply anchored in observation and experience  there s meaning and purpose in this commemorative spectacle  but as peoples guides her characters toward a beauty queen showdown that seems both predictable and not  she suggests that pageantry and performance have their limits  miss juneteenth is a pleasing visual mix of fort worth filmed in pastel colors and rigorously lit  gorgeous portrait shots  
2015,his_house,a commanding debut from writer director remi weekes  here working from a story written by felicity evans and toby venables  elliott s nimble screenplay doles out surprises that are as credible as they are disturbing  
2016,collective_2020,this distressing documentary has relevance way beyond romania  making it a must watch for awards season and beyond  
2017,first_cow,this is a bold  perceptive portrait of early america that deserves to be held up as a new standard of historical filmmaking  first cow is archetypal kelly reichardt  slow  small and perfectly formed  elevated by stellar but understated performances from john magaro and orion lee  watching their friendship crackle into life is one of the film s deepest pleasures  conversation flows so casually that it feels more sighed than spoken  just don t mistake the lightness of step for a softness of philosophy  a picture that s both tranquil and dazzling  two qualities that should be at odds with one another yet somehow bloom in tandem under reichardt s gentle touch  some itchy viewers probably  and understandably  won t make it past the first 20 minutes  but if they stay  the deliberate paces of reichardt s storytelling do cast a sort of spell  a bittersweet comic absurdity  told in the rhythms of real life  finds a warm balance between tension and the pleasure of just watching two kindred types find each other and make a life for themselves in a difficult place  first cow is overburdened by that preamble  which suffuses the film with a feeling of inevitability but not narrative tension  and the plot isn t sturdy enough to fill two hours  an honorable mention  but no best in show  if only every film could achieve the sublime tenderness of first cow  i ve said this before about reichardt s films  and for whatever reason i feel the need to say it again   first cow  will strike some viewers as too little in terms of dramatic machinery  whatever  as with meek s cutoff  first cow is a western that chips away at myth  and wrestles power and history away from the lone white cowboy archetype  
2018,76_days,there are no hugely dramatic moments in 76 days  it is wholly unsentimental and  allowing for the fact the stream of events must be put into some kind of narrative form  unmanipulative  compelling and surprising  76 days is a seemingly apolitical yet oddly sanitised fly on the wall documentary that puts you on the front lines of an eerily well managed response to the coronavirus outbreak  timing is everything in current affairs culture  and this intimate documentary account of the first 76 days of the coronavirus outbreak in wuhan early last year is an illustrative case  crucially  there s also an element of hope and even humour in this affecting tribute to healthcare workers everywhere  the result is less of an expos  than a straightforward video diary  in which doctors and nurses are shown battling against a virus they aren t even sure how to contain  let alone treat  76 days reinforces that their deaths are horrifying  sad  and lonely  with medical staff holding hands  calling them  mother  or  grandfather   trying to give solace along with the palliative care  that it s so artfully and elegantly observed  and packs such a candid wallop of feeling  atop its frontline urgency is testament to the grace and sensitivity of its directorial team  not just their timely savvy  76 days has been made in such a skillful and gripping manner that even those suffering from covid news fatigue will find themselves caught up in it  rarely has recent global history seemed so far away  yet so present  it s one of the year s essential documents  
2019,crip_camp_a_disability_revolution,a vital and joyful work that puts a lesser known part of american civil rights history on the map    at times it feels like crip camp bites off slightly too much for a movie that s less than two hours long  but i can t really blame the directors for cramming in as much information as they can  crip camp is the kind of documentary whose name circulates in must watch lists for months  it s an inspiring true story  accessibly told  mostly  this is an empowering feel good documentary about a small group of people who came together in the right place at the right time   crip camp  shows change can come from anyone  anywhere at anytime  it s a lesson that should always be taken to heart but rings especially true now  the riveting tale of a decades long radical revolution that changed the world forever   it  sounds as if it s going to be good for you rather than good  but it actually turns out to be both   as well as surprising  which is surprising in itself  given that inspirational civil rights documentaries tend to be more alike than unalike  crip camp conveys  as few films do  a sense of lives lived furiously and passionately across a vast stretch of time  the message that inclusivity and community can spur real change is important  and no less urgent today than it was in the 1970s  using a treasure trove of archived footage and colorful contemporary interviews  lebrecht and newnham weave together a punchy  straightforward and inspiring documentary that is greater than the sum of its parts  a raucous odyssey filled with twists  setbacks  smart strategizing  and unlikely strokes of luck  although the template possesses the trappings of what might be called a feel good film  there s happily nothing saccharine about it  a look back at how a new york summer camp run by hippies helped form a generation of political firebrands ready to fire up the disability rights movement  produced by michelle and barack obama  this indispensable doc is the definition of inspiring  
2020,david_byrnes_american_utopia,what they ve managed to do is create a permanent record of this amazing show  which i think will go down as one of the most meticulously crafted and contemplated performances by a major musician in history  director spike lee and musician david byrne have created a crowd pleaser with this spry concert film of byrne s 2018 tour turned broadway performance  it would have been a miraculous celebration of neighbourly love even if it hadn t been released in the middle of a pandemic  but  in these circumstances  that sense of temporary relief feels intoxicating  bolstered by lee s trenchant  intimate direction  byrne reframes a peerless setlist of songs as a testament to hope and humanity that implores himself and his audience to keep going  a little dose of david byrne  unless you re a devoted talking heads fan  can go a long way  while no stop making sense  it s still thrilling to see the singer and his 11 strong band  barefoot in their grey wool suits  romp through talking heads favourites  solo hits and a churning janelle monae protest song  fans of talking heads will want to see this film  i m one of them  so i may be biased  but i think it has a lot to offer anyone interested in the weird world of making music  part pop extravaganza  part poetry slam  it s a wonder to behold  for all of american utopia s joy in revisiting these classics  it also has surprising urgency  full of calls to action  specifically around contemporary black protest  a crucial element of the show s success is its enormously talented multicultural supporting cast of 11 musicians and dancers  who hail from brooklyn to brazil  i dare you not to dance while watching it  american utopia doesn t set the screen ablaze  but byrne and his collaborators certainly know how to put on a show  even when it feels like they re going nowhere

2022,dick_johnson_is_dead,i won t tell you how it ends but i will say that mark twain would probably give it a thumbs up  
2023,host_2020,an effective shocker for our quarantine times  until someone makes a film about a haunted sourdough starter  this ingenious horror movie will remain the zeitgeistiest thing to emerge from lockdown  good directors embrace limitations  and rob savage has more than proven his worth on this front  there are well placed jump scares  ones made all the more impressive by the fact we are seeing them via webcam  an adrenaline spiking fresh take on a well worn horror format  host transcends its high concept premise to deliver original ideas   and scream worthy surprises  host is a lean  nasty little exercise that might not linger for very long but it shows what can be done during this difficult time  savage and co writers gemma hurley and jed shepherd do a fine enough job setting up their movie s better set pieces  but it s hard to overlook some obvious foreshadowing here  and some ham fisted symbolism there  
2024,the_forty_year_old_version,it s a sharply observed comment on the ways women of colour are encouraged to contort their creativity in order to be consumed by white audiences

2026,saint_frances,i do wish  saint frances  indulged in or two fewer getting to know you montages  but i say that about most every movie that comes along  even the good ones  like all the best films about fumbling your way through to deeper self understanding  saint frances doesn t feel too programmed  and leaves a lot of mess on the table  loosely structured  but satisfactory in its narrative shape  the picture deftly escorts us through the embarrassments and dilemmas of everyday life in a hipper part of chicago  you could also describe it as the missing link between bridesmaids and roma  funny  light and perforated with wicked one liners  it takes the initial premise from judd apatow s knocked up and drives it into entirely different and eminently more satisfying territory  o sullivan treats nothing glibly  yet everything can end up funny  her way with a verbal faux pas is peerless  an unflinching portrayal of a lost woman in her mid 30s  a vibrant and emotionally engaging tale that dresses its subversive self determination manifesto in the clothes of a ditzy  bittersweet comedy about midlife disappointment  its gross out empowerment duality acts as a metaphor for a whole host of less visible social and emotional taboos  what looks like a throwaway about a precocious kid and her nanny is actually one of the best and gutsiest movies you ll find anywhere these pandemic days a fun time trailblazer that retains its rough edges to that last  it s some kind of miracle  kelly o sullivan writes and stars in the small masterpiece that s both thought provoking and wildly entertaining  saint frances feels like the beginning of a trend where lesbians of color can be portrayed as matriarchs of an average american family  with mundane and universal marital woes  there s something beautifully refreshing about the casual way that it takes on so many everyday issues that we just never talk about  by the end  the authenticity of their bond feels so well earned that you might not mind watching another movie about them growing up with each other  
2027,time_2020,tears will flow  
2028,onward,onward feels a bit more subdued than a typical pixar affair  and while the movie wears its heart on its sleeve  it might not be quite as engaging for younger viewers  do families need fathers  scanlon delivers a love song to atypical clans  which couldn t end on a sweeter  or clearer  note  the fractious bond between the brothers and their aching anger at the loss of a parent are evoked with exquisite sorrow and clarity  scanlon s film is an improvement on his previous directorial effort  the pointless prequel monsters university  but onward falls well short of magical  even mid level pixar still casts a spell  while it isn t as emotionally involving as some other pixar films  there is sufficient artistry and joyful storytelling here the adventure and world building in onward are utterly delightful with an especially effective balance of playfulness and depth  a likable family comedy that finds an easy rhythm without effort  a testament to the remarkable degree of emotional expressiveness that pixar s character animators can imbue into a story  it s enjoyable enough if you don t mind machine made entertainment  but so desperate to please that it wears out its welcome long before the closing credits  
2029,blow_the_man_down,a tightening of the screws would have helped this thriller immensely  but cole and krudy are after something a little different here than just two sister and one downward spiral  it serves handily as a staycation inside whatever walls currently proscribe your field of vision

2031,the_personal_history_of_david_copperfield,to dickens purists this contemporary view ofdavid copperfieldmay be a bit too radical  but i was certainly entertained  it suffers only in comparison to a beloved movie that swept me off my feet when i was an adolescent 
2032,the_vast_of_night,writer director andrew patterson and cinematographer m i  littin menz are at times breathtakingly mobile as their camera navigates a tiny world frozen in nicotine amber  it s a stark reminder that ideas are more important than production budgets in crafting compelling science fiction  
2033,welcome_to_chechnya,welcome to chechnya  the gay purge  brought home the horror with a dramatic urgency  david france s grimly compelling film was a docu thriller  with heart stopping moments as activists spirited people out of the country in clandestine operations  france sensitively draws out the personalities of his subjects  ensuring that  despite the digital disguises and pseudonyms  they emerge as distinct individuals  it s one of those documentaries that makes you wonder how it even got made    it s a little bit all over the place  but ultimately i found this to be a harrowing  fascinating watch  a documentary that plays like a chilling undercover thriller  an illuminative work that never feels entirely safe  placing the observer in the midst of its subjects in moments where not even they can be entirely sure they ll make it  you re forced to reckon with the nature of identity   how it can cost someone their life  what you get in welcome to chechnya is often a formidably tense  real life drama  rescuing people from chechnya is a genuinely hair raising and dangerous business  france deploys digital means to distort identities but preserve emotions and facial reactions   think  the irishman  but ultimately less distracting  the effect is initially disorienting but preferable to subjects speaking in the shadows  shot by france in guerrilla documentary style  the scenes where they pass through checkpoints  learn of people disappearing  and deal with blown covers build in suspense like a fictional thriller  what s perhaps most remarkable about welcome to chechnya is the level headed perspective many of these subjects have about what s happening to them  david france s most remarkable accomplishment emerges from an aesthetic commitment of a very particular kind  urgently lifts the lid on one of the most horrifying humanitarian crises of present times  the state sanctioned purge of lgbtq people in the eponymous southern russian republic  whether or not you identify as queer  welcome to chechnya will leave you shaken by the evidence of an amoral autocracy taking extreme action under the hypocritical guise of religious purity

2037,mucho_mucho_amor,use stupid things to give a beautiful message of love and peace  i ve heard worse philosophies of life  there are plenty of documentaries that profile famous people  but few ever feel like a celebration  mucho mucho amor captures that joyful nostalgic rush his fans may feel when someone mentions his name or shares a memory of when they used to watch him  still  most viewers will enjoy spending time with this quirky soothsayer and may feel a tinge of regret that they didn t discover him when he was alive  
2038,city_hall_2020,frederick wiseman s documentary offers a hopeful look at political institutions  while the phrase  required viewing  gets thrown around a lot  i cannot think of another film that plainly and comprehensively lays bare the both the complex apparatus at work  and the people dedicated to serving its populace  constitutes a love letter to civic governance  and the notion of democracy  at a time when public discourse seethes with scorn for urban life  with  city hall   his 45th feature  he has composed another epic from a series of intricate  carefully arranged miniatures  a four and a half hour sprawl of a movie that will leave you admiring its agility and concision  i could have watched hours more of people simply talking to one another in auditoriums and across conference room tables  by the time  city hall  arrives at its breathtaking final shots  wiseman has crafted such an advanced case for understanding every aspect of local governance that it leads to the impression that america would be a better place if everyone experienced it  the director champions government and community involvement in an age where reactionaries are still trying to make government small enough to drown in a bathtub and to make individual citizens feel more hopeless and cynical about their elected officials  the result is both sober and inspiring  an urban progress report taking into account a plethora of government services  scutinized by wiseman s patient but unblinking eye  its provocations can seem savage at a glance  but they emerge from an observational tranquility that is uniquely frederick wiseman s own  more than anything  wiseman is showing us that we are not only watching bostonians  but americans  too

2044,extra_ordinary,like those cheeky genre splicing comedies that came before it  the ahern loughman collaboration doesn t merely goose the boundary between charming and outrageous  it gleefully tramples it into oblivion  when extra ordinary finds the right wavelength for its wackiness  the script and the cast effectively straddle the line between gross out gore and silly small town melodrama  some jokes may dissipate quickly  but its unusual warmth lingers in the air like a friendly ghost  a cracking debut feature from irish writer directors mike ahern and enda loughman  extra ordinary is not always subtle  but most viewers will yield to its mystic charms  consistently funny in a pleasingly off kilter way  a light but enjoyable horror comedy romance whose star deserves the exposure  a defiantly odd piece of work  one that comes from a very unique sense of humor that works for most of its running time  even if this is the kind of thing that likely connects with the funny bone more on late night cable than it does in the theater  
2045,slay_the_dragon,this is the best primer on political gerrymandering imaginable and should be mandatory viewing in grad school public policy symposiums and high school civics classes alike  while it doesn t exactly bring new information to the table  the movie provides a welcome breakdown of the dramatic impact that gerrymandering has across american society whenever election season comes around  for those who don t feel up to facing more bad news  there is some hope here in the form of citizen activists doing all they can  
2046,the_dissident,it should be required viewing for anyone who cares about free speech and democracy  
2047,night_of_the_kings,it is perhaps too short to fully explore the themes it raises  or even to fully explain them for a wide audience  but when the prisoners fall under the story s spell  it s magical stuff  lac te is a master at staging hectic crowd scenes in which chaos suddenly arranges itself into patterns  connections  and poetry  in capturing and preserving a long standing oral tradition  he has arrived at both a persuasive vision of the past and a hopeful glimpse of the future  like all good storytellers  he leaves you wanting more  director phillipe lac te balances despair and levity  humanizing the forgotten through a potent blend of african fables  improvisation  and hope however fleeting  the film succeeds in this measure by giving every single performer a distinct personality no matter the screen time  an assured  energetic piece of epic filmmaking  one that celebrates how storytelling  oration  and folklore teach us about our past so we might change our present  philippe lac te s restless film   a rare united states release from ivory coast   braids together its struggles for survival to suggest an entire country fighting to emerge  lac te s film features stories within stories and can be downright confusing to follow   but is never less than mesmerizing  with this venture  ivory coast writer director philippe lac te firmly establishes his place among the greatest african filmmakers  the results are frequently engrossing and formally inventive  even if the finale arrives abruptly  and with a whiff of inevitability  this captivating hybrid of a movie mixes fairy tale and storytelling elements with a vividly drawn backdrop of heightened realism    and relies on images and sounds as much as the human voice to tell its multiple stories  
2048,flee,beautifully animated to protect the identity of the main subject  rasmussen s film examines the lengths we will go to in order to survive and protect those we love  rasmussen uses two very different styles of animation to illuminate the unthinkably hard years the narrator endured  and the emotional pain he s just beginning to process as he speaks about a background he s hidden from almost everyone a feat of humanistic filmmaking  this is a movie we will be celebrating all through next year s awards season and talking about long after  with great resourcefulness  rasmussen puts you through it in a way that illustrates  instructs  makes you look inward and ask whether you d have what it takes  if you could tough it out and survive in a cold  hostile world  innovative and visually dynamic    the animation renders his fond childhood memories with painterly grace  and turns his darkest hours into nightmarish horrors  etched without a false note of cynicism or falling into cheap sentimentality   flee  harnesses the animated medium in stunning form  this gut punch adult animation is a worthy heir to waltz with bashir  its ambition is as challenging as it is gorgeous   flee   which would have premiered at cannes last year had the coronavirus not capsized the festival  is an original artistic exploration of the way that trauma impacts one s sense of self  
2049,house_of_hummingbird,with an easy  lingering tempo and stunning frames shot through with light  this south korean drama leaves the viewer with a sense of contemplative midsummer lassitude  this slow moving but exquisitely drawn character study and coming of age story  which has picked up several awards at film festivals around the world  takes its time getting where it s going  but the cumulative impact of the journey is powerful  sensitive and lived in and strong in ways that a more forceful version of this story could never have been  bora s debut sketches a portrait of a girl coming into her own strength  a thoughtful and engrossing take on a familiar theme that is boosted immeasurably by the contributions of writer director bora kim and young lead actress ji hu park  it s hard to put something like life onscreen  and harder still to make us care  the film is never more intense than when it s finding parallels between its main character s anomie and korea s dehumanizing expansion  
2050,the_fight_2020,very informative  it s not an  eat your vegetables  thing at all  it is shot and cut very thrillingly and you really come to care and appreciate the hard work that these folks put in  this is a jubilant and mischievous documentary that suggests changing the world for the better is something we can all do  effective stylistic choices  like the hand drawn animations that accompany courtroom audio  and a dark sense of humour smooth out any rough edges  it gives each of the cases enough time to play out and also add up to a rich portrait of a complex organization  the filmmakers capture all four lawyers in both vulnerable and heroic moments  snappily edited  with a visual style reminiscent of steven soderbergh s modular design  the fight tells viewers of a certain political perspective what they want to hear  wisely focusing on four key cases  the fight is a worthy attempt to document the aclu s seemingly endless struggle to challenge the many constitutional violations of the trump administration  some stories here end more happily than others  for the bigger picture  of course  there has been no end at all  the selfless commitment of its subjects to justice are what makes it worth a look  the film justly draws attention to the perpetual work that must go into preserving democratic institutions   f rankly  it s nice to see david beating goliath on the big screen  
2051,a_secret_love,everyone who sees this film will have their own favorite moments  
2052,rewind_2020,unquestionably difficult to watch   wait until you learn details of uncle harold s  punishment    neulinger s heroic act of bravery will hopefully encourage and inspire others to come forward  throughout it all neulinger remains undaunted and relentless but also artful  as he shows how cinema can both conceal and reveal  how it can evade the truth  or confront it  and by so doing transcend it  conveys an unforgettable sense of all that s stolen when children are abused as well as the heroic bravery  compassion and togetherness required to combat such cruelty  rewind is the adult sasha s film  a harrowing but enthralling documentary feature that explores his family archive in order to understand the recurring sexual abuse that blighted his childhood   rewind  could only be made by this filmmaker in this way  and that gives it an unsettling fascination  though difficult to watch  it s a film that helps outsiders confront the horrifying ways such events can cause damage for decades after the fact  watching the movie is like staring at a blurred image of the past that gradually  over 86 minutes  comes into terrifying focus  it s hard to imagine the courage which went into the making of this highly personal documentary  
2053,coded_bias,you really walk away with the sense  oh  this is just everywhere  and we have to stop and talk about it right now before it gets out of hand   coded bias is not interested in wallowing in despair for the future  like many tech infused documentaries like to do  kantayya wants to inform and inspire change  katnayya s documentary and its unsettling findings should be mandatory viewing for silicon valley innovators  a movie about algorithms might sound boring to the non hacker crowd  but kantayya keeps things lively and easy to understand by avoiding technobabble and personalizing her story  shalini kantayya s coded bias effectively brings to light a modern civil rights issue that can be proven with data  the documentary dives down the rabbit hole to chillingly  comprehensively expose how algorithms can perpetuate bias in often unforeseen and unjust ways  a chilling plunge into orwellian reality  without shying away the issue s enormity or its devastating consequences  coded bias gradually works toward almost inspirational vibe  as buolamwini and others get to work solving the problem they ve identified  
2054,make_up_2020,it s an insightful  deeply felt film that lets us in on a personal evolution  it is a dull commonplace to describe a debut as promising  but oakley s film really does point towards a grand future  she can have the du maurier comparison for free  eerie images of a bloodied fingernail and long grass lit by amber floodlights signal oakley s sly sense of humour and eye for visual poetry  this magnificently unsettling british debut is a serious calling card for writer director claire oakley  this is no vanilla infidelity tale  the emphasis is on self discovery and sense of place over straightforward storytelling  writer director claire oakley s atmospherically charged debut brilliantly confounds expectations and marks her as a visionary new talent to watch  the scares here are suggestions  as the best kind always are  set at the littoral intersection between land and water  make up also merges a grounded naturalism   bleak if beautifully framed   with the more fluid dreamscapes of ruth s subjectivity  from this  a new british filmmaking talent comes out  claire oakley has created a vivid sensory experience out of limited means  make up is anything but cosmetic   it gets right under the skin  claire oakley s genre bending debut feature slowly reveals itself as a lesbian romance that s as much about learning to love yourself as your lover  and it s a gorgeous and inventive piece of cinema

2060,la_llorona_2019,the cast has an unprecedented chemistry that is held together by actress maria mercedes coroy and her incredible on screen presence  the scares in la llorona comes from waiting to see just who will get his or her comeuppance  and when that finally does arrive  it s both thrilling and somehow doesn t cut as deep as one would have hoped  
2061,the_painter_and_the_thief,if this were a fiction film it would surely be dismissed as totally unbelievable  since it s not  this portrait of two totally fascinating characters proves to be as riveting as any thriller  the painter and the thief is a superb norwegian documentary about a painter who befriended the criminal who stole two of her paintings  he then became her muse  a true crime tale reconfigured into a unique relationship saga  replete with twists  turns  heartbreak  failure and redemption that s as surprising as it is well earned  benjamin ree s extraordinary documentary feels like a movie   there s a heist  villains who are not what they seem  scenes of striking intimacy and some fabulous twists  a beautiful story about extraordinary compassion  what an engrossing film   and the gender reversal of a male muse inspiring a female painter has got to be one small step for art world equality  one leaves the painter and the thief feeling eager to see what might happen if we were kinder and less self interested  and convinced anew of the basic connection between paint and the human heart   t here are moments so intimate and unguarded that you may briefly dissociate and question what you re watching   a documentary  or its carefully scripted and acted narrative counterpart  the concept of being seen through someone else s eyes drives the best parts of the painter and the thief  a documentary that illuminates a great deal about the human condition even if it does kind of fizzle out in the third act  the beauty of the film lies in the bond she forges with one of the thieves    the relationship between barbora and bertil  as she calls him  grows on camera from improbable friendship to spiritual love  twists and turns shape the narrative  but not always to ree s benefit  he responds by scrambling his film s chronology in ways that threaten to rupture any sense of trust between director and viewer

2072,why_dont_you_just_die,this extravagantly violent russian comedy thriller is tremendous fun  offering wall to wall gore and super stylised visuals  this bloody chamber piece is not for the squeamish  a rip roaring  bloody slice of russian genre cinema that combines a tightly plotted narrative with a stylish command of craft to hugely entertaining  immersive effect  it s a movie where you will know pretty quickly whether it s going to be for you or not  i liked it right away  when the viscera is flying  this approach works beautifully  even when you re watching matvey get brutalized through hands clasped over your eyes  you re still watching  sokolov s debut feature is a clever  bloody as hell  often hilarious virtuoso exercise in excruciating harm doing among mendacious people  a grand guignol bloodbath which comes on like a homicidal remake of meet the parents  edited with a collection of power tools  sokolov has gotten our attention  but it s been almost two years since this nasty little number premiered on the genre film circuit  why doesn t he just direct his next movie  a confidently mounted blur of different filmmaking styles  ethical codes   generational clashes that welcomes the viewer to laugh  wince   gawp at its messy excess  while cheering on a young antihero who surely cannot survive his ordeal to the end  a splatterpunk action comedy drenched in gleefully dark russian humor  
2073,the_swerve,a relentlessly unshakable albeit unpleasant ride  particularly when filmmaker dean kapsalis slaloms around audience expectation  something he skillfully accomplishes for the first two thirds of the picture  azura skye s tremendous performance  is  as unblinkingly honest as anything gena rowlands has done     no less irresistible and poisonous than the nation s prevailing patriarchy  making holly s violent deviation from her prescribed homemaking path the last tragic swerve of a woman in trouble  
2074,apples,there s something resonant and recognisable in its tale of literally learning how to live again in the wake of disorienting trauma  while occasionally too muted for its own good  apples does benefit from not pushing its quirk factor too hard   that would only have set up a barrier between us and servetalis s hollow detachment  it s a tender but slight debut from nikou  though certainly signals him as a filmmaker to keep an eye on  the question of what we might be when we can t remember who we are is made fresh once more  the answer  not so weirdly  is altogether moving  here nikou satirises the banality of the human condition by reducing to a standardised bucket list the experiences  joining a protest  crashing a car  a one night stand  that we imagine constitute our very individuality  apples is an offbeat treat that manages to embrace ironic distance and emotional weight through a prism of perfectly judged absurdism  very much in the vein of what has been dubbed the greek  weird wave   it may also delight admirers of swedish absurdist roy andersson with its drily humorous tableaux   t he droll twilight zone absurdism is not without its pleasures  many of them comic  this hugely accomplished  satisfyingly textured first feature is really something special  if the venice selectors were looking for a fitting film to open this year s orizzonti sidebar  they could hardly have done better than christos nikou s splendidly poignant and creepy apples  
2075,farewell_amor,one of the great strengths of farewell amor is its intimacy  the sense it conveys of three people close together yet emotionally distant in walter s small  narrow brooklyn apartment  another strength  and a huge one  is mr  mwine s portrayal of walter  there are three sides to every story in ekwa msangi s vivid and carefully observed feature debut  and so she cleverly splits the film into thirds  replaying the action but changing the vantage point with each chapter  an auspicious start to a career that s likely to accelerate fast  a compassionate  empathetic  and moving exploration of love and family  and what these ideas can even mean after so long apart  the performances sell it  especially from lawson  who comes out a real shining star  not just in her obvious dancing abilities  but in how she telegraphs so much with so little  in her feature film debut  writer director msangi reveals the maturity of her storytelling talent and her strong aptitude for eliciting terrific performances from her actors  its beauty lies in its empathy   something currently in short supply and therefore very welcome in the stories we consume  msangi and cinematographer bruce francis cole capture the various experiences at play in farewell amor with equal sensitivity  even with its share of conventional elements  farewell amor never plays out quite as you might expect  msangi s film succeeds because each character is flawed and human and just trying to do the best they can against sizable obstacles  ultimately this family drama is very touching and it finds its path  wait for it  as tender as it is terrifically acted   farewell amor  tells an immigrant tale that will seem familiar to many but leaves a very specific impression  it s a captivating and well acted character study about connection  loss and the emotional labor needed for second chances  
2076,gunda_2020,while gunda exhibits tremendous empathy  it does not indulge in anthropomorphism or court sentimental responses  to further preempt such mawkishness  kossakovsky shot it in b w  the pink body of a piglet is thus less likely to elicit awwww than awe  gunda may not technically be a silent film  but its expression through movement functions much the same way  with our minds filling in experiential gaps to create something that feels narratively whole  you ll feel like you re making new best friends when you watch  gunda   it s as pure a farmyard experience as a movie can conceivably be  gunda personalizes these animals without humanizing them  and evacuates explicit humanity without ignoring its clear impact  a cinematic triumph of porcine poetry  few films capture the intense  sticky bond between a mother and her offspring so simply and wrenchingly  without remark  or convey the knowledge that we carnivores are devouring souls with every bite of bacon  the message comes through loud and painfully clear  no dubbed voices required  kossakosky s achingly beautiful black and white documentary is ground breaking and wondrous for its intimacy  there s no dialogue  we just watch the animals go about their lives while we experience the quietly dawning recognition that these animals have real lives  kossakovsky isn t out to lecture or confront his audience with moral rhetoric or shock imagery  but to encourage understanding of farm animal life as it s being lived   not just valuable at the point of death  
2077,fourteen_2019,there s nothing in fourteen that moviegoers have not seen before  but the empathetic performances by both medel and kuhling make this a journey worth taking  the rare movie that intelligently and compassionately honors the push pull dynamic between two young women  a pair of brooklynites whose tight bond began when they were children but is starting to fray  the film s rhythm might sound jarring on paper  but fourteen is more a work of structural playfulness and experimentation than gimmicky manipulation  it resorts neither to buddy movie clich  nor melodramatic angst in portraying the ways we outgrow our friends  and they us  what i love about the film  among other aspects  is how the wry verbal wit of the early conversations suggests a mordant comedy  almost a working class variation on the films of whit stillman  denying the satisfaction of grand expressions or gestures  sallitt instead uses time to show the changes in jo and mara s relationship  the diverging paths and seething conflicts of two lifelong friends  now young brooklyn professionals  are explored deeply and poignantly in this deceptively calm melodrama  written and directed by dan sallitt  sallitt s thoughtful  incisive film articulates the feeling of an intense companionship fading imperceptibly over time  this is a wonderful  subtly devastating film from a voice in american independent cinema that will hopefully become better known  
2078,slaxx,slaxx uses almost lo fi theatrical techniques to turn objects into monsters  
2079,news_of_the_world,a beautifully crafted  no frills adventure which often feels like an homage to westerns of yore  news of the world has many of these wise  unforced moments on its way to a final scene in which the on screen audience applauds wildly  my sentiments exactly  greengrass s charming western would form the ideal centrepiece for a festival that showcased directors working hard to be something other than what we expect them to be  news of the world is narratively slight  but it is a terrific showcase for two actors at completely different ends of their careers and a quietly emotional dispatch about two broken souls learning to heal  yet the film rarely ignites  is devoid of urgency and leaves its oscar winning star treading water throughout  doling out kindly hanksian smiles and fist chewing platitudes in place of actual dramatic intrigue  neither performer overdoes the sympathy that develops between kidd and johanna  and the film is tender without descending too far into sentimentality  tom hanks is immaculate as this world weary wanderer  imbuing him deep sorrow and humanity  he even rides like a genre veteran  a rough and tumble texas road trip movie finds the right balance of character insight and bare knuckled action  helena zengel is a marvel  she can be wild in one scene  defiant later  curious the next and emotionally shut down in another  she speaks volumes even without dialogue  kidd feels like an ancestor of saving private ryan s captain miller   a man who is adept at violence but will only use it as a last  mournful resort  helena zengel has one of those faces that you can just stare at for the entire film  you can see the intelligence behind her eyes  
2080,the_go_gos,watching the film  it s pure pleasure to witness such scrappy exuberance  such mayhem so enthusiastically pursued  a testament to sisterhood and how age  wisdom  and an understanding of how rare and special certain relationships are can bust through even the most hardest grudges  what makes this documentary feel specific and alive is the way she vividly takes us back to the early days  letting the go go s reminisce about their beginnings and tell their own stories  in her contemporary interviews with the band members  ellwood has captured them all at a time of life when they are prepared to look back at their youthful selves with a mixture of generosity and clear eyed candor  the indescribable chemistry between carlisle  wiedlin  schock  caffey  and valentine is fully on display throughout the doc  like the elements of a good hit song  it all comes together and seems fresh  it may sound like something you ve heard before  but it also sounds new  a music bio doc that embodies the rebellious spirit of its subject  tackles the seminal all female  80s rock band with such honesty and effervescence that it not only rises above that clich d  almost telegraphed arc but transcends the ranks of other music documentaries  backed by a wealth of video footage  archival photographs and gig posters  ellwood captures the determination with which the band thrust itself forward  neither glossing over nor digging too deep into the hint of ruthlessness with which early members    
2081,fireball_visitors_from_darker_worlds,fireball  visitors from darker worlds is an absorbing look into how this cosmic phenomenon has inspired human civilisation itself  a film that can be a bit dry when oppenheimer leads the scientific discussion but that springs back to life when herzog the filmmaker allows his awe to come through the camera  the film ranges far afield and interviews an engaging and eclectic mix of people  anyone else would pursue the obvious angle  how long until the big one  despite his cheery fatalism  herzog proves less interested in apocalypse than in how meteors have shaped all prior history  the film s true focus  however  is those who love meteorites and are excited to share that passion  their ardor burning as brightly as those streaks through the sky  one of the most striking effects here occurs whenever werner herzog and clive oppenheimer slow down the film s often hectic pace to let viewers ponder the sheer beauty of the imagery  this film is charming and educational enough  but it s not especially profound  it flirts with big ideas about the origins of life and the twin cycles of creation and destruction but doesn t really let them sink in  herzog s documentaries have grown shaggier and more episodic over time  but this one is often lost in space without him on screen as its star  come for the opportunity to hear werner herzog utter the words  a beach resort so godforsaken you want to cry   but stay for the german director s journey into the world of meteors in this half amusing  half illuminating documentary  
2082,the_last_tree,thoughtfully alternates universal adolescent insecurities with urgently specific minority politics   filtered through a first person perspective that itself oscillates between furious clarity and vivid confusion  
2083,rocks,this tough but hopeful london coming of age story will fill your heart  
2084,assassins_2020,well worth checking out  
2085,babyteeth,shannon murphy s direction keeps up the antic spirit with a jagged rhythm that mirrors the unpredictable state of mind at chez finlay  you don t know what these characters are going to do next  even more engaging is the fact they don t either  eliza scanlen mainlines its young protagonist with herky jerky energy and otherness as she rapturously loses herself in music  dancing and the swells of first love  
2086,the_white_tiger_2020,any hope or salvation the white tiger offers is laced with a drop of arsenic  and there are certainly no bollywood dance numbers to lift your spirits  balram s tale is rich and ruthless enough for both approaches  and for any country built on a premise of one class eating another  the caste system has figured in a lot of movies about india but i ve never seen one quite like the white tiger  which explores with devastating effect how such a system can distend the souls of both servants and their masters  the white tiger feels like a fable  one that illustrates how trapping people in poverty so there will always be someone to do wealthier folks  bidding is as much a function of psychology and culture as of economic opportunity  a wild  stylized ride with just the grounded touch needed to infuse this whirlwind with great purpose and heart  chopra does her bit  though her american desi rebellious  bahu  is a bit fuzzily dealt with  but the film belongs to adarsh gourav  who channels that very specific  razor sharp mixture of obsequiousness and rage  to come up with a stellar performance  we don t need to warm to the characters to be enthralled by this compulsively watchable class parable  the movie naturally pulses with life and energy  invigorated by its narrative sweep  its nimble camerawork and propulsive musical score composed by danny bensi and saunder jurriaans  the white tiger has an icy cool  slick visual style and an unsubtle but effective running commentary about social warfare  for its letdowns  the white tiger offers its writer director an encouragingly big canvas  which is heartening for an artist whose early work managed to take an inch and run a mile  proving all the more evocative for being so streetwise and constrained  the lively narration and rollicking pace make for favourable comparisons to scorsese s goodfellas  a terrifically cynical yet sanguine tale of bootstrapping     what makes this contemptuous tale glorious is that bahrani s stinging social commentary has exuberance even during its darker moments  
2087,shithouse,through cinematographer rachel klein s intimate lens that values long takes and close ups  raiff on the whole transposes a youthful world on to the screen  adorned with profound existential worries of early adulthood  there s real potential in this scrappy first feature  raiff deserves credit for an unexpectedly elliptical coda  but much of the chatter between the leads has the emo tedium of dorm room blather  the film excels at capturing the emotional substance of what we think we remember about our pasts  well pitched and briefly suggesting a less intellectually ambitious kid brother to before sunrise  the film s only serious misstep is its name    whenever  shithouse  starts drifting towards a more generic energy  or gets the tiniest bit too plotty for its own good down the home stretch  gelula is there to bring things back on course  
2088,feels_good_man,seeing what happened to furie and his chill stoner frog dude    will likely make your blood run cold  it sure makes for a chillingly effective internet era cautionary tale  this engrossing documentary follows the character s gentle creator  matt furie  as he tries to reclaim his frog from the hatemongers  not content to string together talking head interviews  the movie uses art and animation to find a cinematic equivalent for pepe s evolution from a quirky cartoon animal into a weapon  jones uses furie s story  and some gorgeous animation  as a wonderfully succinct window into the way social media has changed the country  that the democratization of the internet has opened a doorway for fascist ideologies to openly quash democratic ones is an irony that isn t lost on the film  the blind optimism with which furie believes that incels and radicals will finally get bored of pepe and just sort of hand him back will break your heart  jones demonstrates an insatiable curiosity about his subject  speaking with everyone from a former trump campaign insider to a collector of rare pepes to an expert on the occult  while  feels good man  is stretched a bit too thin to really pierce what it feels like to sit there and watch the world corrupt your art  furie s general powerlessness is endemic to this story in ways that have nothing to do with his personality  most of the lines it draws through online trainwreck culture and shifts in mainstream culture are clear  harrowing and appropriately cautionary  
2089,a_shaun_the_sheep_movie_farmageddon,i was delighted throughout  
2090,kajillionaire,the chemistry between rodriguez and wood is undeniable  and rodriguez s more naturalistic performance balances out her costar s affected shuffling and deep  gravely monotone  kajillionaire takes a heartbreaking story   a child of abuse trying to escape her sociopathic parents   and bloats it so full of little miss sunshine kook that any emotional sharpness is left soft and doughy   kajillionaire  keeps getting sidetracked by its own offbeats  resulting in an experience that s equal parts endearing and exasperating  the film s sparkiest revelation is rodriguez  almost spectacularly charming and skilled as an ing nue schemer with more life experience than she s letting on  oddities abound in july s gently absurdist films  you either roll with it or not  but when you give in  you go through them childlike  experiencing real and surreal together  this is comedy wed not just to melancholy but to a deep sense  maybe fear  of failure  kajillionaire won t make anyone rich  but who cares  miranda july s films are miniature fairytales played out of tune   whimsical and sweet  with a tartness right at their centre  on relationships  july remains as perceptive as ever  almost everything on camera is  wacky  with a screamingly conspicuous capital w  kajillionaire has a harder edge than july s earlier pictures  with something bleaker and more ironic in the surrealism  the unexpected pleasure of kajillionaire is that  with the singsong delivery dialled down just a notch  you can hear yourself think long enough to decide  not quite a critique of the adorable whimsy of her early work  kajillionaire is a head on encounter with the psychic tensions that always undergirded it  
2091,a_white_white_day,palmason boldly risks audience disenfranchisement by pushing his disturbing story to unexpected lengths dramatically and stylistically  thereby winning a creative wrestling match with a potentially intransigent narrative  
2092,zappa_2020,captures its subject s spirit without tipping into mere hero worship  
2093,just_mercy,foxx does his best work in a decade  for the charismatic jordan  who puts in a tone setting nuanced turn here  just mercy arrives between creed ii and tom clancy s without remorse  let s hope he sticks with the  one for them  one for me  formula   just mercy  is solid  meat and potatoes docudrama filmmaking  if you don t mind a first rate story of systemic injustice undercut by second rate dialogue  an earnest and important film about the still festering sore of race in today s america   though when pitted against inveterate  sneering prejudice  its protagonist s one note saintliness  however real  does not make for the most compelling drama just mercy isn t interested in giving it a showy new spin  instead the extraordinary  hope inspiring true story is allowed to speak for itself  powered along by committed turns by jordan and brie larson  it s good acting at its finest in this preaching to the choir  right to life  drama that might have worked had the filmmakers chosen to show the audience a little mercy by not constantly talking down to them  just mercy isn t stylistically dazzling  the chronicle of racism is also familiar  but cretton and his leads give the narrative an urgency and timeliness  this is a powerful drama about an important ongoing issue  the film has this kind of slow burn quality  it has a very good ensemble cast   i t s never less than engrossing  even with the schmaltz  the film s power lies in the brutality of its true story  and yet that narrative stays within fairly conventional bounds precisely because of cretton s commitment to telling it  
2094,borat_subsequent_moviefilm,cohen seems to understand that the film s shock value is automatically lower because of how deadened audiences have grown to political satire  so he relies more heavily on sitcom jokes to compensate and largely succeeds  a feature length exercise in gratuitous insult and unpleasantness  it illuminates almost nothing about america that we don t already see in mainstream and social media every day  bakalova plunges into it with aplomb and steals the show from baron cohen  who mostly reprises his old shtick  tricking people into saying things they probably wouldn t want to be seen onscreen saying  
2095,emma_2020,if anyone were to push emma woodhouse into a less straitened age  why not the woman who captured childish gambino in a palm tree polyblend  
2096,yes_god_yes,karen maine s script confronts catholicism s bare faced hypocrisy with satirical aplomb  maine s semi autobiographical tale strikes just the right notes over its 74 minute running time   and while the material may be objectionable to some  this roman catholic found it to be hilarious and engaging  despite the breathtaking unfairness perpetuated by so many characters under the pretext of faith  the film shows remarkable empathy not only for dyer s heroine  but also everyone around her    maine uses meticulously composed yet freely imaginative visual and sonic textures to develop the film into a vivid  varied comedic drama and an intricate portrayal of inner experience  a sweet sincere film about a girl getting all twisted up because of the mixed messages passed down to her  raunchy coming of age comedies that satirize religious hypocrisy don t usually leave you going   aw  that was so sweet and innocent   a charming and highly engrossing feature debut from karen maine with a standout nuanced performance from natalia dyer  maine captures this struggle with the good natured humor of someone who has realized the ridiculousness of this logic yet harbors no hard feelings  
2097,blood_on_her_name,allowing the viewer to piece things together on their own is always welcome  but the film s desire to surprise and outwit makes it contrived  
2098,sylvies_love,a sublimely versatile and aching performance by tessa thompson succeeds in holding interest in this rather long movie about star crossed lovers who come together and fall apart in the sultry new york summer of 1957  
2099,mank,more than a magnificent technical achievement  mank is hypnotically entertaining  it won t be for everyone  but in the canon of films about film making  there are few as textured  as committed and as suffused with real appreciation for the craft as mank  this is masterful filmmaking about old hollywood that reflects on this year s tangled election  dor all its skill and scrupulousness  i found the film a strangely remote emotional experience    a slice of black and white that never quite bursts into living color  an astutely probing and pain filled work of speculative historical psychology and a vision of hollywood politics that shines a fervent plus  a change spotlight on current events  it expresses both appreciation for and wariness of hollywood s allure and its ability to shape reality  a worthy  eminently watchable entry in the annals of hollywood self obsession  although fincher s attention to detail results in a beautifully detailed and largely accurate recreation of the era  it is anything but a loving or nostalgia tinted portrait
