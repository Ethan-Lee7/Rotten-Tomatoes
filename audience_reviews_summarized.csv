the_white_tiger_2020,"  ""A hollywood level production. This movie captures your imagination and takes you into the world of the lead character.  ""The story, the concept indigestible. Criminal is made hero here."
feels_good_man," A worth watch with great art details  ""Basically a story about the internet from people that do not know the internet.  ""Such an important and fascinating story. Must-see!  ""Interesting story. Worth watching."
a_shaun_the_sheep_movie_farmageddon,"  ""Oscar nominated animated film... the Claymation Shaun the Sheep franchise rolls on with this one.. and the animation is decent and the story is sweet and a bit creative.. but it""s definitely aimed at an age group considerably younger than me so it often felt really slow.  ""Il sequel perfetto per l""acclamato film d""animazione del 2015: mantiene le stesse caratteristiche generali cambiandone sostanzialmente il tema e, in parte, l""ambientazione. L""umorismo visivo resta coerente e segue lo stesso stile del suo predecessore, offrendo del sano divertimento per tutte le età.  ""Cuando vi la primer película de Shaun the sheep me pregunte porque es tan buena película y a la ves por que no y una sensación similar ocurre con esta que me resulta difícil de calificar ya que tiene un gran valor por detrás hecho"
kajillionaire,"  ""Sensitive, smart, funny and different.  ""Perfectly awkward and emotionally true"
a_white_white_day," So beautiful to look at. You immerse yourself into it slowly, without even noticing it.  ""It may take trudging, but the fantastical dream sequence like camera work and the bond between grandfather and granddaughter make it all worth it.  ""Aimless nonsense. There was no plot. If you liked Birdman you""ll love it. If you have taste, I wouldn""t waste an evening"
just_mercy,"  ""Really good made me cry  ""Jamie was overlooked  ""This movie was amazing!  ""One of the best movies I have seen so far."
zappa_2020,"  ""The biographical documentary ""Zappa  ""I still don""t think he was all that but definitely good for what he was and did"
birds_of_prey_2020," Definitely not the best nor worst DCEU movie.  ""Achei um filme muito bom, muito divertido  ""I wanted to give it a zero star 😐"
borat_subsequent_moviefilm,"  ""The original was pretty funny. After that...nope.  ""It was stupid and disgusting.  I had to turn it off.  How it was nominated for anything is beyond me.  ""Parts of this film were funny, but I mean...it""s Borat. Funny and asinine at the same time.  ""It has its moments, and I appreciated the social commentary, but it was not as funny as the first one."
emma_2020,"  ""I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation.  Bill Nighy""s Mr. Woodhouse was particularly charming.  ""Might be my favorite Emma adaptation. Great chemistry between Anya Taylor-Joy and Johnny Flynn.  ""striking. if wes anderson & jane austen had a baby it would live in this universe.  ""Loved it! It was funny, beautifully made and entertaining. The cast did a fantastic job."
yes_god_yes,"  ""the void, nothingness  ""Short and enjoyable. Worth the watch.   ""It""s stupid, pathetic and waste of time!!!"
mank," I didn""t like the way it felt but the story can be a snooze feat sometimes  ""I would have liked it better in color and I think a lot of other viewers would also. The black and white is pretentious.  ""Gary Oldman has been one of my favorite actors since the 90""s. That said,this was 2 hours of him hearing himself talk."
sylvies_love,"  ""It definitely had promise and I loved the music and the nostalgia, but despite the great performances storyline was very disappointing.  ""Lovely movie! Modern love story but set in the 50s  ""it is so refreshing seeing black love without all the toxicity that the media loves to portray!"
