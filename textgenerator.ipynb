              "'It\\'s an adroit manipulation of interviews and stock footage, mostly along the lines of establishing not so much what Hammerin\\' Hank did for himself, but what he meant to American Jews.Kempner demonstrates how the star\\'s success and dignified bearing inspired a generation of Jews to fight through the ethnic barriers in all fields.Writer-director Aviva Kempner crafted this love letter to Greenberg by imaginatively weaving interviews with great footage from newsreels and feature films.Aviva Kempner hits a grand slam in her thrilling documentary about baseball, about a great baseball player, about Jews in America and about the country itself in the 1930s and 1940s.The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg is a gem of a baseball documentary because it illuminates what the Hall of Famer\\'s splendid career meant away from the ballpark.Aviva Kempner\\'s warm and intelligent mash note to a man who clearly deserved it.Aviva Kempner\\'s documentary The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg does what a historical documentary should do. It tells an inspiring story while bringing the past to life and illuminating issues that persist today.Aviva Kempner\\'s documentary celebration of the Detroit Tigers first baseman defines one of those instances-- rarer than sportswriters admit -- in which a champion athlete becomes a genuine, all-around hero.Hank Greenberg is an unabashed paean and just a joy to watch. It should be required viewing for all modern athletes who disregard their role-model status.Kempner\\'s lighthearted yet not apolitical collage conveys how Greenberg\\'s success as an athlete in the 30s and 40s contradicted an ethnic stereotype.This gem will lift the spirits of baseball fans.As good-natured and inspirational as its subject.Sharing its subject\\'s virtues, it is a lovely addition to the annals of the Greatest Generation.It seems too much to ask a movie to entertain, inform and inspire. For it to also work as sports story, social history and biography is a home run with men on base.Kempner is content not to question his heroism, which is usually a suspicious practice for a documentary, but a myth as powerful and sustaining as Greenberg\\'s is better left unpunctured.While it preserves his baseball feats, it looks beyond them to clarify Greenberg\\'s place in American culture.For once, the image and the reality make for a perfect fit -- the man and the symbol are one.Greenberg seems down-to-earth and likable, and director Aviva Kempner slips in just enough baseball history for nonfans to follow Greenberg\\'s story without getting bogged down in diamond minutiae.The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg is a sprightly, lovingly researched, rather misty-eyed sports documentary that\\'s steeped in ethnic pride.Kempner\\'s documentary, which has some very funny moments too, weaves an affectionate portrait of the larger-than-life ballplayer into the complicated layers of prewar America. This is the world discovered and illuminated by gonzo documentarian Marc Singer, who spent a good part of two years living with and chronicling the lives of a half-dozen tunnel dwellers for his remarkable first film, Dark DaysMoving and memorable.The lives of these people inside their shacks are full of surprises as well as grim confirmations, but the things we don\\'t know about them also significantly shape our experience of the film.Singer deserves credit for attempting to put a human face on such tragic circumstances, but he appears to have gotten so close to his main subjects that he seems unwilling to make them, or their desperate situation, look too bad.Some of these hardy souls have lived this way for years, decades even, and they\\'ve lived not just to tell the tale but to suggest that they\\'ve created a viable alternative existence. At times, Dark Days almost makes you envious. But only almost.Revealing, if occasionally frustrating.A fascinating, beautifully photographed portrait of a vanished community: a group of homeless people who built a shanty town in the train tunnels beneath Penn Station.Singer\\'s stark black-and-white photography renders their world with the abstract horror of a German expressionist film, yet he\\'s equally skilled at coaxing the grim personal stories of life underground.Singer captures intimate moments in the lives of his subterranean protagonists in their strange, crepuscular world.A portrait of the homeless community of \"mole people\" who lived in sections of disused underground tunnels in New York, this is a singularly powerful account of the lives of the dispossessed and desperate.Designed neither to warm your heart nor shelter you in the comfort of liberal guilt, the movie does what so many style-conscious, \"subjective\" documentaries have long forgotten how to do. It shows you a world, and stays the hell out of it.Singer achieves remarkable intimacy with his subjects, who share their experiences and joke around with the man behind the camera as freely as they do with their peers.The ending is pat but the characters\\' tragic stories linger on, squatting in the darker corners of your mind.A black-and-white hymn to the energy of the dispossessed, made in the late 1990s, but still horribly relevant.I would love to see a kind of 14-Up sequel: what\\'s happened to these people in the interim? A tough, compassionate movie.As superficial as Dark Days was, the subject is singular enough for the film to be memorable.It\\'s distinguished by remarkable intimacy, with none of the arty distance or aesthetic pretension a veteran filmmaker might have imposed. Singer\\'s subjects feel more like collaborators, an ensemble cast.Complemented by its black-and-white photography and a moody DJ Shadow score, this is a gritty yet often tender look at society\\'s margins.The movie, as heroic as it may have been to produce, is more noteworthy for its intentions than its execution.Marc Singer\\'s feted 2000 doc about a Manhattan subterranean community has lost none of its power since its debut. []Best for older teens, especially Sex Pistols fans.[][][][][][][][]To see this film\\'s footage from the \\'70s is to see the beginning of much of pop and fashion iconography for the next two decades. All [the performers] draw lively reactions from the crowd who get to chant, \"I am somebody.\" And isn\\'t that all what we want to be?It is a fine documentary in that it does, better than any popular music film with the possible exception of Woodstock, document a group of people, their music, how it came to be, and why they like it.This is a fragmented, skittery film that does not have enough moments of interest and hilarity to offset the stretches of boredom.Simply as a means of recording the fruition of hope among a centuries-maligned minority Wattstax can stand proud.Just when you figure that the film industry has exhausted every possible avenue of exploration in the quest to present still another music festival documentary, along comes something with a nice, fresh twist. Such is the case with Wattstax.Once In a while, a muslc-oriented film can transcend the ordinary and become a chronicle of a social mood instead of an on-film record of a concert. It was that way with Monterey Pop and Woodstock; it Is that way with WATTSTAX.It\\'s a rich tapestry incorporating documentary footage -- the \\'65 riots, interviews with Watts residents talking about being black in America -- that puts its musical performances (staged by Melvin Van Peebles) in a broad social context.Richard Prvor, the satirist, is very funny; Rufus [Thomas is] a joy to behold in outrageous pink shorts and cloak.Stuart uses the music as an expression of common feeling, and he intercuts concert footage with interview material... The result is necessarily superficial, but it does give the people a voice, and the tone is insistent and important.The cinema-verite material is very cunningly incorporated with the festival coverage of many major black rock activities to make an overall rhythmic pat- tern full of life and vigour.The swaggering \"Theme From Shaft\" fades into the unsparingly sad state-of-the-community number \"Soulsville,\" beautifully summing up what\\'s come before.There isn\\'t enough music, but Stax have at least had the wit to hire Richard Pryor to deliver one of his characteristic monologues (the rest of the time is filled out by chats with the denizens of Watts). Much good music all the same.Wattstax is a technical treat, with good sound, recording adding to the flavor of the music.[]The restored rerelease is a time capsule of Afros, anger and attitude.Rarely has a concert -- or a concert film -- been so shaped by its social context. Wattstax was both the definitive record of popular music circa 1972 and a say-it-loud statement of black aspirations.A time when not only a single record company could put together a day like this, but could then give every dollar made to charity.It just has the air of something too carefully laid out in advance. It\\'s so busy being glossy and optimistic that it doesn\\'t even allow its performers time to create on screen a measure of the excitement they might have created in person.A candid, colorful and deeply meaningful sociocultural time capsule.A recording of a historic moment, Wattstax has considerable value. [Spike Lee] knows the show belongs to his comedians, so he aids and abets from the shadows like the best of accomplices. The result is the Stop Making Sense of stand-up comedy moviesTheir comic material is all cut from much the same cloth and lacks variety: their viewpoint is middle-aged; their \"attitude\" is strenuously confrontational.There are some good gags and routines here, but loads of them have been done with far more invention and wit by Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy.Sorry, but the king has long been crowned -- these funny men are merely pretenders.Like their predecessors, [Steve] Harvey, [D.L.] Hughley and Cedric [The Entertainer] transcend their immediate audience and create flashes of recognition that will hit home with nearly anyone.As a testament to the vitality of black comedy, The Original Kings Of Comedy is a success. As a comedy, however, it\\'s sluggishly paced and not nearly funny enough to justify its two-hour running time.The Original Kings of Comedy doesn\\'t have the theatrical subtext or, let it be said, the genius of Richard Pryor. But then again Pryor went out for an hour or 90 minutes and just talked. These guys are working in a revue format.Footage shot from over their shoulders reveals a sea of faces out of which individuals quickly emerge, as the comedians -- especially emcee Harvey -- enthrall and provoke audience members.A consistently hilarious assemblage of highlights from the hit concert tour of the same name.This is comedy with a sense of showmanship, and Lee cuts shrewdly to the rhythm of the jokes.Seeing the film in a crowded theater is a lot more fun than watching it on TV would be, and the crappy, grainy look does create a sort of you-are-there immediacy.It is a simple, straight forward record of four hugely talented African-American comedians, Steve Harvey, DL Hughley, Cedric The Entertainer and Bernie Mac, as they bring the house down in Charlotte, North Carolina.Shrewdly executed, often hysterical.[]Under Spike Lee\\'s direction it\\'s one of the liveliest concert films in years.They form a hilarious and even poignant conscience for a brand of black humor much deeper and wiser than what we\\'ve seen on screen this year.All these men ... have their mirthful moments.Boasts the highest laughs-per-minute ratio of any in this season\\'s hilarity.These kings ... eventually walk off the stage without the viewer knowing any more about them than when the film began.At times the material grows as repetitive as it is profane. []A fascinating if somewhat unfocused documentary.Schneebaum, a dull and helpless-looking nonentity at first glance, proves to be an amazingly courageous, inquisitive, remarkable man.There\\'s no denying the warmth of Schneebaum\\'s encounters, or his engaging nature. Or the fact that you\\'ve never seen a documentary quite like this one, and aren\\'t likely to again.Makes for fascinating, compelling viewing.What begins as a curious document, then, evolves into something more.An extraordinarily absorbing documentary.Unfortunately bitten off more than it can chew.A documentary that understands the uniqueness of the man who is their subject without patronizing or exploiting him.An engaging and colorful but somewhat overbalanced documentary.Provides a fascinating glimpse of how the human spirit struggles with, shades, rationalizes and finally accepts the shocks of unfamiliar and unpleasant reality.What\\'s brilliant about the film is that it doesn\\'t quite buy its hero\\'s somewhat self-serving account.The Shapiros wisely focus on the mystery of this man.It\\'s worth seeing simply to make the acquaintance of Tobias, a really extraordinary old guy.Rather than observe events as they happen, the filmmakers force things, manipulating Schneebaum and the audience to serve their agenda.Meanders, dawdles, doubles back on itself but finally gets us somewhere fascinating and worthwhile.As [Schneebaum] explains the male-male relationships and the absence of stigma or judgment, the film soars.Uses a single notorious incident to liven up an otherwise less-than-riveting story.Schneebaum is a great subject; the film doesn\\'t quite make the most of him.[] []A multilayered documentary that explores music and friendship, and in its own quiet way, the battle with fame.If you hadn\\'t guessed already, this is a movie about the deep-reaching allure of roots music. However, the very fact that it\\'s about the roots music performed by these two unlikely collaborators makes it something more.If you come to Grateful Dawg to hear a lot of wonderful music, you\\'ll walk away satisfied.A must for any Deadhead and of genuine interest to any music fan, even if its documentary chops hit a few sour notes.It may not be much in the way of documentary filmmaking, but for fans of Garcia, Grisman or good old-fashioned American music, it\\'s enough to be grateful for.This one\\'s for Deadheads and dawg-lovers only.Though Grateful Dawg isn\\'t a great documentary, it holds plenty of enjoyment for acoustic-music fans.In the nimble hands of Garcia and Grisman, a reggae song such as \\'Sitting Here in Limbo\\' or a blues number such as \\'The Thrill is Gone\\' are tickled to new life.The pure joy of music-making is what this gem of a film is all about.Think of this movie as a glorified home video rather than a bitingly insightful documentary. But for Garcia and Grisman, this soft-shoe approach couldn\\'t be more appropriate.An affectionate, familial documentary giving credit to an unsung music hero.Ms. Grisman strips away everything but music and friendship, and that proves to be quite enough.A sleepy ride through long, woolly concert takes, as well as onerous (often repetitive) interviews with the band.Whether on stage or in the studio, the sounds Grisman and Garcia made together are a joy to behold.This delightfully unpretentious documentary presents some terrific performance footage of the two men.For those who have never previously encountered Garcia or Mr. Grisman, here is an opportunity to make their rewarding acquaintance.For music fans, there\\'s great pleasure in hearing new audio tracks to \\'Sitting Here in Limbo,\\' \\'Friend of the Devil\\' and more songs -- each one complete and unedited.Enjoyable little fan film.The movie\\'s too mellow cool for its own good. Fascinatingly evokes not just the gruelling, first-person details of this particular polar expedition, but the waning moments of the entire spirit of romantic, white-European Boy\\'s Own adventurism.Beautifully blends interviews with scholars and descendants of that crew, still photos and movie film from the trip and re-creations of the events of the voyage.Footage from a remarkable silent documentary has been combined with new photography, music and a narration to produce an even more remarkable sound documentary.Most of all, it is a salute to Shackleton himself, whose calm and grace under extreme pressure helped guarantee that not a single crew member would be lost.Those who see Endurance, however, are not likely soon to forget what they see, even if they have some difficulty imagining how it could be possibly be true.Anyone interested in great stories should be interested in this one.A triumph.The nail-biting quality of Shackleton\\'s true story outdoes any dramatic fiction on the market.An engrossing chronicle of the legendary voyage.It\\'s worth seeking out, definitely.This wonderful documentary benefits from the inclusion of unique archival footage that was filmed during the two-year journey.Aimed at a more adult audience than Adventure, Endurance has a haunting, melancholy quality.The story to unfold elegantly, without embellishment, and it is more powerful for that restraint.Unimaginable, incredible, and harrowing beyond words.What lifts this film above the usual public television documentary is the copious archival footage.A gripping documentary tells the wrenching story of a 1914 polar expedition that was hell on ice.The added material does little to diminish the story\\'s epic punch and, if anything, magnifies its elegiac grandeur.You become like a restless child at bedtime stilled and enraptured by the sheer power of narrative, and your skepticism is overwhelmed by a childlike greediness for vicarious adventure.Essential viewing not just for those fascinated by adventure, exploration and survival, but for anyone interested in the magic of leadership.A testimony to the triumph of the human spirit, and a reminder that, under the right leadership, humankind is capable of virtually anything. Documentary best for teens interested in business.[][][]Too short of detail to really serve as an object lesson to those who follow in their footsteps.Distilled from over 400 hours of filmed material, Startup.com offers continued evidence of the essential nature of the documentary format.The pain and puzzlement of its principals as things inexorably fall apart is palpable and saddening.Talk about your fabulous story arcs.Astute and entertaining.Startup.com humanizes the dot-com goldrush that in the last few years has left a handful of millionaires and hundreds of go-for-broke paupers in its wake.The best movies, it\\'s often said, are happy accidents. Startup.com proves the dictum while being smart and responsive enough to react to the impending train wreck.Nearly two years in the making, Startup.com nevertheless arrives in theaters feeling almost like breaking news.. As an inside view of the bursting of the Internet bubble, Startup.com is definitive.Startup.com brings you to an unstaged, evolving economic jungle where survivors are very fortunate -- and friendships are at high risk.Both because of its emotional urgency and its timely subject, this small story that tells the much bigger story of the New Economy\\'s bubble and burst is less a documentary than it is breaking news.Combining the immediacy of the Internet and the wise perspective of history, Startup.com proves that investing in real-life drama can reap rich dividends.An eye-opening documentary.Seems too raw -- unedited and undifferentiated.Some people are finding it difficult to live with the idea that Kaleil could put his employees through hell, lose $60 million of other people\\'s money, and wind up a movie star.Benefits from everything about the Internet with few of the insufferable tech-head side effects. It\\'s made with great authority; director Stacy Peralta, in his younger years, rode ramps with the best of them and was the movement\\'s shrewdest self-promoter.You want to know more about their private lives than you get. But most viewers may be too stoked by the sheer adrenaline rush of the subject to care.Package is lively, if loosely structured.This propulsive, highly satisfying 2002 documentary concerns a group of daredevil skateboarders from an economically depressed and dangerous area of Santa Monica known as Dogtown who reinvented the sport in the 70s.Infectiously exuberant.Quite possibly the best documentary about youth and sport since Hoop Dreams.Few sports films catch their time, place and sport so well.It\\'s impossible not to admire his joie de vivre -- and this movie\\'s joie de vivre, as well.Although devoid of objectivity and full of nostalgic comments from the now middle-aged participants, Dogtown and Z-Boys has a compelling story to tell.This is pop history that blows your hair back.Blatant promotion aside, the chronicles of Dogtown make for fascinating insider cultural history.Enormously enjoyable, high-adrenaline documentary.An informative, nostalgic trip back to a fascinating era, told by those who knew it best.You may see more important, more moving, more meaningful documentaries in your time. But you will never see one cooler.An exhilarating, breathless, must-see chronicle of the skateboarder revolution and evolution.This engrossing, definitive documentary on the birth of Southern California\\'s outlaw skateboarding culture is a jaw-dropping piece of work.When these guys were headed down the street at 50 m.p.h., you got out of the way.The film has an infectious enthusiasm and we\\'re touched by the film\\'s conviction that all life centered on that place, that time and that sport.Even if you couldn\\'t care less about skateboarding, Dogtown and Z-boys serves up an intriguing slice of American culture.The problem is that Peralta wants it all, and that it doesn\\'t all add up. The Gleaners and I shows Varda in full flower, ever reaping what she has sown.[A] lyrically ramshackle essay about people, including Varda herself, who don\\'t fit into society\\'s cubbyholes.The Gleaners and I is a film well worth finding.Charged with the pleasure of discovery.The Gleaners and I is an exceptional, accomplished documentary that serves as a striking example of \\'found cinema.\\'For the most part, Varda\\'s home movie is a simple and sweet thing.Varda\\'s subject matter is surprisingly rich, but it\\'s her own energetic, curious nature that gives the film its snap.In its frames, we see [Varda\\'s] empathy, skill, curiosity, wit, poetry and passion for life: everything she has gleaned from a lifetime of love and movies.[The] characters are defined by dawdle and drift as much as Varda is in The Gleaners and I, catching life on the fly -- and implicitly inviting us to do the same.And in what appears to be a documentary [Varda] conceals a tender meditation about her own life, and life itself.[]The film is studded with found metaphors and serendipitous insights.A superb example of the genre of the self-expressive documentary.Urgent, graceful, accessible and at times openly cheerful -- it takes a big bite out of life.[] Powerfully illustrates what globalization has been doing to underdeveloped countries around the world.This case study of globalization\\'s effects on Jamaica is a timely, never dull piece of agitprop that comes off as a cross between Godard\\'s social protest docs and The Harder They Come.Talking heads are intercut to synthesise theory and practice, but as an economic diatribe this is a bit patronising and not wholly persuasive.Here is a documentary that should be mandatory viewing for anyone interested in globalisation that, war or no war, remains one of the most contentious issues of our times.As an expose of such international carpetbagging, Life + Debt is brilliant stuff.An eye-opener and a primer on why the IMF and the World Bank are not to be trusted by emerging third-world countries.It\\'s mostly persuasive in the position it argues.... after viewing Life and Debt, the audience\\'s way of seeing things has been quietly and powerfully changed.The damning commentary and revelations about the perils of globalization, not just for Jamaica but developing countries the world over, do come across loud and clear.An intelligent movie about economics.After viewing documentarian Stephanie Black\\'s dour exegesis of the wrecked Jamaican economy ... only the most insensitive vacationer will want to set foot anywhere near the resorts and beaches of Montego Bay.Life and Debt often feels like a cheap shot, but it can still pack a wallop.Offers the clearest analysis of globalization and its negative effects that I\\'ve ever seen on a movie or television screen.A travelogue with teeth.If you\\'re curious about why the demonstrators are so angry, this is why they\\'re so angry.Sheds light on the effects of globalization, free trade and world economic policy by providing a straightforward, insightful analysis of complex, important issues. A profoundly touching look at the plight of gay Orthodox Jews who are trying to integrate their sexuality with their religious beliefs. While the style is not innovative, the subject matter is groundbreaking.[]This insightful documentary simmers with a fury that\\'s passionate enough not to need spelling out.A unique documentary about the crisis confronting gay and lesbian Jews who wish to remain part of the Orthodox and Hasidic branches of Judaism.So how do gay men and lesbians who want to practice Orthodox Judaism reconcile these two seemingly contradictory forces in their lives? Director Sandi Simcha DuBowski\\'s Trembling Before G-D examines this dilemma with compassion and sensitivity.To the film\\'s considerable credit, it focuses on the power of faith more than on the power of desire.A remarkable film, for thoughtful people of all beliefs.DuBowski\\'s skillful documentary techniques aid in creating compassion for these outsiders.Trembling Before G-d has no answers to the questions it raises, but by daring to ask them, DuBowski has done much to lighten the shadows.It\\'s that dilemma -- a commitment to Orthodox life, the refusal to deny one\\'s sexuality and the fear of expulsion once that sexuality is revealed -- that director Sandi Simcha DuBowski illustrates so powerfully.... the film succeeds in shedding revealing light on a group of individuals who are particularly reluctant to face a camera lens.Sandi Simcha DuBowski\\'s wonderful documentary, Trembling Before G-d, extends a warm embrace to those struggling to reconcile sexual orientation with the teachings of the religion in which they were raised and which they cherish.Bravely, carefully, urgently, DuBowski addresses a subject long concealed by multiple barriers.A compelling illustration of the all-too-human need for acceptance and approval.Short, but emotionally effective.An unexpectedly moving family portrait of cousins we didn\\'t know we had.DuBowski\\'s subject is so compelling that the film doesn\\'t suffer from his traditional approach, which relies on to-the-camera interviews and verite footage of his subjects.While the compiled testimony is strong, some larger context is missing.Workmanlike and steadfastly well-intentioned.DuBowski has made a loving documentary that ably leavens its tears with the healing balm of humor: a consummately Jewish way to go. [][]As much a thrill to watch as it is to listen to, a rare combination for a concert film.Collectively, the numbers add up to a triumph of ecstatic mood swinging.This is one fan\\'s valentine to the music he loves. It just happens that the fan is a terrific filmmaker and the music loves him back.Although it isn\\'t the human-interest story that Buena Vista Social Club was, Fernando Trueba\\'s Calle 54 is the next best thing to that milestone musical documentary.What makes Calle 54 great is precisely what\\'s missing from the other. Trueba shows us the creative act of playing music, not just a bunch of famous folks performing.It is easy to imagine Calle 54 having a long shelf life on home video after its run in theaters. It can be played over and over again with increasing satisfaction.A good listen without being a particularly good watch.The knowledge of the musicians\\' connection to one another makes it the most touching interlude in an overlong but nevertheless entertaining film.There\\'s not been a more infectious jazz performance screen treat since 1959\\'s classic Jazz on a Summer\\'s Day.A brilliantly conceived and elegantly realized documentary tribute to Latin jazz, it packs more drama into each of its 12 musical tableaux than most feature films manage in two hours.This is one summer movie with real sizzle.Descriptions of great art are, of course, ultimately irrelevant, and Trueba knew we\\'d have to experience his passion for ourselves. He\\'s offering a dazzling invitation -- take him up on it.Music and movies are two of the great international languages, something Fernando Trueba\\'s Calle 54 proves with wide smiles and an irresistible beat.A loving Buena Vista Social Club -style hymn to the rhythm and life of salsa.The film will greatly appeal to current fans of the musical genre and should win over more than a few converts.You come away with more appreciation of how inclusive Latin jazz, with its roots in Africa, really is.The film is such a pure expression of the director\\'s love for the music, a love so infectious it should leave you elated.A must-see for avid fans and a welcome primer for nascent hip-shakers everywhere. A sharply observed and richly detailed nonfiction feature that plays like feel-good, crowd-pleasing entertainment.Director Kenneth Carlson may be a little too close to the subject of this documentary.Energetic and absorbing documentary.A smart and often mesmerizing look at how high-school sports can hold a medium-sized town in its grip.Achieves a neatly balanced tone right smack dab in between reverence and ridicule.An enthralling look at the drama that can transpire in the autumn of one small town on any given Friday.A complex, revealing look at a year in the life of a small town and the tangled politics of the citizens\\' blind love of the game.Manages to be probing about its subject without overdoing pageantry or shortchanging passion.The movie argues that Massillon lives for football, that it creates identity and pride, and on the evidence I would have to agree.Absorbing.A nifty piece of entertainment that says a lot about American society.A superbly crafted piece of humanistic cinema.Carlson has pieced it together in such a way that it represents a genuine crowd-pleaser.Deftly treads the line between condemnation and compassion.The funny and touching result is worth cheering for. The result is a powerful, moving and often very funny exploration of what it is to be an American.Families should see this m-a-r-v-e-l-o-u-s film.[]A tribute to old-fashioned virtues of hard work, education, competition ?√π and good spelling in a spellchecker age.A hilarious look at one of America\\'s best-loved institutions.Spellbound is not a great piece of filmmaking, but it is more entertaining than you might expect from a story whose heroes are all brainiacs.Spellbound finds its thrills with nary a chase scene nor a quick cut; it\\'s a simple and utterly gripping story about kids, words and a microphone.[]When a child stands at the microphone and frantically writes invisible letters on her hand, we can\\'t help but love each and every one of these people.A genuinely charming and often funny documentary about the high-pressured world of competitive spelling.Whatever else it may be, this is also a film about being young, hopeful and focused.An unpretentious classic of the form.It makes having brains cool.Just might be the most action-packed suspense thriller of the summer.One of the many pleasures in Spellbound is watching the reactions of these young brainiacs.Spellbound is a gorgeous weave.Entertaining documentary.Jeff Blitz\\'s delightful documentary on the National Spelling Bee and its grammar-school competitors will win your heart.There is something so purely and positively American about Spellbound that it is indeed spellbinding.All of the kids and their stories are remarkably compelling. [][]An absorbing portrait of a unique artist\\'s professional and personal communion with nature.A beautiful, probing art documentary.Most of Goldsworthy\\'s work is impermanent, but Rivers and Tides captures, permanently, both the art and the artist, showing us a creative, productive life in the process of being well-lived.[]The artistry of Thomas Riedelsheimer\\'s film perfectly compliments Goldsworthy\\'s art.[Goldsworthy\\'s] art is meant to be evanescent, like the nature he reveres. We are privileged to see it documented by the filmmaker\\'s camera.Mr. Goldsworthy\\'s work is meant to be photographed -- \\'photography is the way that I talk about my sculptures,\\' he says -- and Mr. Riedelsheimer rises to the occasion.Andy cuts an eccentric but likeable figure genuinely at a loss to explain where his inspiration comes from.Assumes a meditative, Zen-like quality that sends the viewer floating away, like a leaf.Like Goldsworthy\\'s art, it is primal, transcendent and truthful.We grab at beauty while simultaneously realizing it never can be possessed, a feeling brilliantly captured in this thoughtful and rewarding movie.The sort of film that sounds completely kooky until you see it. At which point it\\'s still pretty kooky, but you realize just how cool kooky can still be.Watching Goldsworthy painstakingly piece together his artwork, we come to realize that his artistry lies as much in the act of creation as in the fleeting final product.A calm and lovely film that audiences hungry for beauty will likely devour with their eyes.The trouble with this art movie is that it\\'s more a movie than it\\'s art.Watch this film. You may never look at nature indifferently again.Watching this movie is like daydreaming.I know of no documentary on a contemporary artist that conveys so much about the artist\\'s work so lyrically and directly. Readers of these pages need no introduction to Michael Moore, nor will they require any acrobatics on my part to go see Bowling for Columbine, which is (brace yourselves) pretty terrific.Must-see gun violence documentary is brutal.It\\'s both powerful and infuriating, brilliant and facile, hilarious and horrific, witty and demagogic. It\\'s a great movie to argue about.[][]All in all, Mr. Moore has given us a lot to think about in Bowling for Columbine, and he has entertained us royally in the process.Fun and informative, thoughtful and thought-provoking.Fascinating, thought-provoking, often fitfully funny and sometimes devastatingly sad.A worthy successor to Roger & Me.This is a bold, blackly comic masterpiece -- everyone should see it.A sweeping, sometimes insightful and often funny look at America\\'s culture of violence.Bowling for Columbine would never be mistaken for even-handed, but it is at least a sincere attempt to find the source of this country\\'s inability to curb gun violence and murder.By turns hilarious, infuriating, moving, manipulative, self-serving and, most importantly, absolutely required viewing.[Moore\\'s] better at fingering problems than finding solutions. But though he only scratches the surface, at least he provides a strong itch to explore more.There is simply no doubt that this film asks the right questions at the right time in the history of our country.At its best, which occurs often, Michael Moore\\'s Bowling for Columbine rekindles the muckraking, soul-searching spirit of the \\'Are we a sick society?\\' journalism of the 1960s.Even those who would like to dismiss the film outright should find much to mull and debate.We need [Moore\\'s] noisy, cocky energy, his passion and class consciousness; we need his shticks, we need his stones.Mr. Moore aims at so many targets and tilts at so many windmills that his arguments lose persuasion.Even Moore\\'s detractors, should they be inclined to see the film, will admit that he takes a refreshingly nuanced view of the issue. []A gripping documentary that reveals how deep the antagonism lies in war-torn Jerusalem.What\\'s so extraordinary about this Oscar-nominated work is that it shows us that conflict through the eyes of seven bright, funny, thoughtful kids, ages 9 to 13, on both sides.Beautifully crafted and brutally honest, Promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of prejudice.Every individual will see the movie through the prism of his or her own beliefs and prejudices, but the one thing most will take away is the sense that peace is possible. That, in itself, is extraordinary.It\\'s sobering, particularly if anyone still thinks this conflict can be resolved easily, or soon.A diverse and astonishingly articulate cast of Palestinian and Israeli children.Unexpected, and often contradictory, truths emerge.Takes a simple idea and just about breaks your heart with it.For one moment, the patience of documentarians nurtured understanding among strangers accustomed to being enemies -- for which a prize is surely in order.At times an almost unbearably moving portrait of innocence lost and how ideologies easily infect young minds.If you like peace, you\\'ll like Promises.Beautifully crafted and brutally honest, Promises offers an unexpected window into the complexities of the Middle East struggle and into the humanity of its people.Keeps its word.Demonstrates the unusual power of thoughtful, subjective filmmaking.I wonder what the reaction of Israelis will be to this supposedly evenhanded presentation.Many insightful moments.An earnest, roughshod document, it serves as a workable primer for the region\\'s recent history, and would make a terrific 10th-grade learning tool. In a larger sense, this powerfully muckraking film is about the accountability of public figures and about how, in regard to international justice, there can be no exceptions.Eugene Jarecki amasses a compelling body of evidence suggesting that Kissinger should be formally investigated for a possible role in the CIA-supported coup.Even if the case against Kissinger is not fully convincing, the documentary keeps you glued to your seat and thinking long after you\\'ve left the theater.The film is insightful about Kissinger\\'s background and history.Fascinating to watch as a portrait of political celebrity and ego.A stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for Kissinger as a calculating war criminal.While the filmmaking is standard documentary fare and the approach overtly biased, the narration, with tales of intelligence intrigue and ruthless foreign policy, is compelling and convincing.Scores by marshaling facts that speak for themselves. And they don\\'t speak kindly.Haunting music, the seriousness of the allegations and riveting interviews with Alexander Haig, Christopher Hitchens and others give Kissinger extra drama and urgency.Takes a fresh and absorbing look at a figure whose legacy had begun to bronze.Deploying a seamless blend of talking-head interviews, trenchant archival photographs and newsreels, topped off by a sheaf of newly declassified U.S. government documents, Gibney and Jarecki are smart enough to let the evidence and experts do the talking.Both damning and damned compelling.Not everyone will welcome or accept The Trials of Henry Kissinger as faithful portraiture, but few can argue that the debate it joins is a necessary and timely one.It makes compelling, provocative and prescient viewing.Watching this film, one is left with the inescapable conclusion that Hitchens\\' obsession with Kissinger is, at bottom, a sophisticated flower child\\'s desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power.Enjoyably fast-moving, hard-hitting documentary.May not be a breakthrough in filmmaking, but it is unwavering and arresting.We still live under the Kissinger doctrine that, as one British observer puts it, \\'international law applies to everyone except Americans.\\' Truly a gripping story, but for mature teens only.[][]If you love flamboyant people, movies or -- especially -- flamboyant movie people, don\\'t miss The Kid Stays in the Picture.This movie is more fun than many of those tall tales that Hollywood calls feature films.Even at his most obnoxious, Evans remains a fascinating figure.For a life lived boldly and productively if imperfectly, Robert Evans deserves this trenchant, revealing, vastly entertaining documentary.Giddy, absurdly entertaining account of Evans\\' rise and fall in the movie biz.An engrossing portrait of a man whose engaging manner and flamboyant style made him a truly larger-than-life character.This is classic Hollywood, at its best and worst, sticky rich and scabrous.[]It\\'s Hollywood navel-gazing at its best.For movie lovers, it\\'s like an aging Lancelot reminiscing about Camelot.Should delight anyone who ever wondered how Tinseltown really works.The thing about guys like Evans is this: You\\'re never quite sure where self-promotion ends and the truth begins. But as you watch the movie, you\\'re too interested to care.Even if you don\\'t emerge from the film ready to worship at his Beverly Hills altar, you wind up liking the guy.Evans is shameless, but his self-deprecating humor takes the sting out of his \\'truth.\\'A little like being stuck at a fellow\\'s deathbed, listening to him gas and gas about his life -- only in this case, the guy turns out to be fascinating.It\\'s the very best kind of documentary -- an irresistible story, creatively and elegantly told.Hugely entertaining from start to finish, featuring a fall from grace that still leaves shockwaves, it will gratify anyone who has ever suspected Hollywood of being overrun by corrupt and hedonistic weasels. [][]Engaging documentary.Pray has really done his subject justice.Pray\\'s subjects can wander off into arcane Dennis Miller-esque rants, but he manages to hit the high points and most of the major personalities.It\\'s all stitched together with energy, intelligence and verve, enhanced by a surplus of vintage archive footage.Illuminating if overly talky documentary.Should appeal to more than just hardcore hip-hop fans.An engrossing and infectiously enthusiastic documentary.Exciting documentary.Nothing short of a respectful testament to the ingenious creative drive of the outsider.Pray has managed to create a historical document accessible enough for novices and credible enough for aficionados.Edited and shot with a syncopated style mimicking the work of his subjects, Pray turns the idea of the documentary on its head, making it rousing, invigorating fun lacking any MTV puffery.Does what a fine documentary does best: It extends a warm invitation into an unfamiliar world, then illuminates it fully and allows the larger implications of the journey to sink in unobtrusively.Thanks to so many articulate DJs and terrific footage, the documentary is a must-see for hip-hop fans ...If you, like me, have never been convinced that spinning and mixing other people\\'s records requires a musical skill, these guys will educate you as they twiddle and tweak like amped-up octopi.Dense, exhilarating documentary.Not only an exuberant portrayal of hip-hop\\'s self-healing, it\\'s a compelling meditation on the future of making music in America. [][][]The Funk Brothers seem to have hardly missed a beat.There have been better documentaries to come out this year, but none can touch this one for unadulterated pleasure.I promise, you\\'ll never listen to a Motown classic in the same way ever again.The documentary stumbles where it could have soared.Try as you might to resist, if you\\'ve got a place in your heart for Smokey Robinson, this movie will worm its way there.You may not end up dancing in the street, but don\\'t be surprised if you cut a step or two in the parking lot.The movie lets us realize this Sound, still so alive and vibrant today, was created by flesh-and-blood people, each of whom has a compelling story to tell.A triumphant documentary.The sheer joy and pride they took in their work -- and in each other -- shines through every frame.It\\'s a blast!When all is said and done, there ain\\'t no mountain high enough that should keep you from getting to this movie.The Motown Sound was, quite simply, their sound.A great story and great music, right down to the final credits.When the old guys sit around and tell their stories, Standing in the Shadows of Motown catches magic on the screen -- a behind-the-curtain peek at some of the world\\'s best-loved music, straight from the cats who made it happen.After watching it, you can only love the players it brings to the fore for the gifted but no-nonsense human beings they are and for the still-inestimable contribution they have made to our shared history.Standing in the Shadows of Motown is one hell of a party, and it doesn\\'t let anything get in the way of that.Gives credit where credit\\'s due. []If names such as Bernadine Dohrn, Bill Ayers, Mark Rudd, Naomi Jaffe and Brian Flanagan mean nothing to you, you\\'ll definitely want to see the thought-provoking documentary, The Weather Underground.The Weather Underground leaves the viewer with many questions. To the filmmakers\\' credit, most of them are the right and urgent ones to ask.Directors Sam Green and Bill Siegel expertly limn the forces that gave rise to Weatherman and clearly sympathize with the group\\'s motivations. At the same time, they don\\'t stint on Weatherman\\'s follies.Whose side the documentarians are on is never clear -- in a muddy rather than an ambiguous way. Did anyone die from the Weathermen\\'s bombings? We don\\'t find out here.Thought-provoking.An eye-opening look at idealism taken to extremes during one of the most turbulent periods of American history.A remarkable journey.What\\'s forceful about The Weather Underground is how effectively the filmmakers convey the violent zeitgeist of those years.A compelling piece of work that turns out to have unexpected relevance to the current world situation.Essential viewing for anyone who wants to know the roots -- and perils -- of modern political dissent.A fascinating window into American political history.A smart, absorbing, often exhilarating documentary.The Weather Underground chronicles those early days of idealism, and their transition into a period when American society seemed for an instant on the point of revolution.What it needs is more context, social and psychological.A powerful and searching documentary.Powerful and surprisingly timely.This terrifically smart and solid piece of filmmaking lets the former Weathermen, now in their 50\\'s and older, speak into the camera and reveal a bit of their personal histories as well as what the peace movement meant to them.Filmmakers Sam Green and Bill Siegel tend to shy from tough questions, allowing their subjects to wax nostalgic about bomb-throwing as yet another youthful folly of the \\'70s.Sam Green and Bill Siegel\\'s often gripping documentary manages to evoke the particular quality and extent of the madness that possessed many Americans during the course of the longest foreign war in the nation\\'s history. Joyously re-creates the brief but resplendent reign of the legendary freakadelic drag troupe.Maybe it\\'s the old-timey, silent film title cards, or the vaudeville piano tinkering on the score, but The Cockettes produces a yearning wistfulness for another time and place -- specifically, 1970s San Francisco.Cockettes has the glorious, gaudy benefit of much stock footage of Those Days, featuring all manner of drag queen, bearded lady and lactating hippie.As Weber and Weissman demonstrate with such insight and celebratory verve, the Cockettes weren\\'t as much about gender, sexual preference or political agitprop as they were simply a triumph of the indomitable human will to rebel, connect and create.An insightfully cheeky entertainment.This expert, heartfelt movie establishes them as being as much a part of swingin\\' San Francisco as the Grateful Dead or the Beats.Manages to transcend the sex, drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer.It celebrates the group\\'s playful spark of nonconformity, glancing vividly back at what Hibiscus grandly called his \\'angels of light.\\'An irresistible documentary look at the ensemble of the moment in the hippie kingdom of San Francisco, this comprehensive and charming film not only recalls those days exactly, it also manages the wonderful trick of taking us back there along with it.An entertaining film.A funny, triumphant, and moving documentary.Indulgent, tedious documentary.It turns out there is quite a lot that the endlessly recycled and diluted images of the storied counterculture have obscured about some of the most interesting and vital parts of the culture itself, which the filmmakers have brought triumphantly to life.Fond, funny documentary.A succinct, intelligent and scintillating slice of cultural history.A sweet-natured reconsideration of one of San Francisco\\'s most vital, if least widely recognized, creative fountainheads. [][]Is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of Wilco\\'s last album?If you aren\\'t already a fan of Wilco, a critical darling led by the talented and wily songwriter Jeff Tweedy, the film does little to enlighten or recruit.Woven together handsomely, recalling sixties\\' rockumentary milestones from Lonely Boy to Don\\'t Look Back.The film doesn\\'t show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes Wilco a big deal.A cohesive demonstration of why Wilco, as a whole, is one of the most compelling musical entities working today.Even if you don\\'t know the band or the album\\'s songs by heart, you will enjoy seeing how both evolve, and you will also learn a good deal about the state of the music business in the 21st Century.Fans of critics\\' darling band Wilco will marvel at the sometimes murky, always brooding look of I Am Trying to Break Your Heart.The plot twists give I Am Trying to Break Your Heart an attraction it desperately needed.An undeniably gorgeous, terminally smitten document of a troubadour, his acolytes, and the triumph of his band.Jones has crafted a natty narrative that, enhanced by Erin Nordstrom\\'s editing, is filled with payoffs.A tuneful, heartfelt tale of artistic struggle and eventual triumph.Tells Wilco\\'s story so well that you\\'ll leave the theater thinking the album is a work of genius.The unexpected drama captured puts I Am Trying to Break Your Heart in the good company, if not quite the league, of Let It Be and Gimme Shelter.It testifies to art\\'s vitality and endurance, despite its marketers\\' -- and sometimes even its makers\\' -- efforts to the contrary.Largely a for-fans artifact.Fans of the band will know that the album was eventually released by Nonesuch and became a success. Yet Mr. Jones manages to generate some authentic dramatic tension and suspense.The concert footage is stirring, the recording sessions are intriguing, and -- on the way to striking a blow for artistic integrity -- this quality band may pick up new admirers.An exciting and involving rock music doc, a smart and satisfying look inside that tumultuous world. [Traudl Junge] complicates our understanding, instead of insulting it.After a silence of nearly 60 years, Junge describes with great clarity the circumstances of her employment and the daily business of Hitler\\'s reign, up to and including the last days in the bunker.[][]You almost feel as if Satan\\'s personal assistant had decided to pull up a chair and tell all. Is it possible not to be interested?For Junge, even 60 years later she still has trouble forgiving the 22-year old woman she once was for being seduced by that influence.Both a documentary and, for all intents and purposes, the last testament of a generation\\'s tragic folly.Makes us wonder, in a very human sense, about the various blinders we all adopt to make our peace with life.Both mesmerizing and disquieting.Isn\\'t much of a movie, but it\\'s a whale of a story.A footnote in the troubled history of the world. A footnote, yes, but a fascinating one.The film\\'s legacy is a poignant reminder of how Hitler\\'s shadow still looms.It is mesmerizing at times, repetitive at times, and most revealing when it separates the Adolf Hitler the world knew from the private Hitler.Because it is all monologue, the film has the effect of a casual lecturer\\'s going on for 90 minutes. But what a lecturer and what a 90 minutes!You won\\'t take your eyes off Frau Junge\\'s pale, intent face, as in a steady voice she tells an astonishing tale.It is a firsthand account from an eyewitness to history, a woman who was at Hitler\\'s elbow until the very end.A chilling documentary that draws its impact purely on Junge\\'s personal testimony.Perhaps most distressing to subject and audience alike is the way one can be at the epicenter of history and still remain blind, both because the actual evil is happening elsewhere and because it\\'s easier to not look.Traudl Junge\\'s story is riveting.Although it has a stripped-down, cinema verite simplicity that suggests unrehearsed spontaneity ... the compulsively fascinating Blind Spot: Hitler\\'s Secretary also has the quality of a near-operatic epic performance. []Prepare yourself for nights wandering around the house singing unshakable tunes.The flabby, fawning film Gigantic comes across as 102 minutes of rib-nudging by one of the duo\\'s annoyingly self-satisfied connoisseurs.Predictably, Flansburgh and Linnell are the saving grace of the movie, both in their interview segments (refreshingly witty, although the editing could have been tighter) and particularly in the live footage.Tries to be as irreverent and bouncy as a song by its subject, and succeeds for the most part.A modest amusement.As tooting-your -own-horn documentaries about innovative alt-rockers who\\'ve been around for 20 years go, Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns goes very well indeed.[]Clever in a good way, this spirited documentary delves gently into the story of indie band They Might Be Giants, building a case for a couple of good-natured visionaries and pioneers who blazed trails for non-hair bands in the early days.Their sheer existence affirms that all things corporate and bland don\\'t always win out -- that music can be intimate, political and alienating, sometimes all on the same album.A gift for those already in the fold, for those who get the joke and just want to savor it with other like-minded fans.Does ample justice to the complexity, even profundity, of a creative collaboration that has brought deep joy and meaning to generations of fans throughout a career that just entered its third decade.The movie provides nearly as much pleasure as a greatest-hits CD -- although not quite as much as hearing \\'Don\\'t Let\\'s Start\\' for the very first time.The movie offers a generous helping of rock \\'n\\' roll but no sex or drugs on the side, unless you count buckets of coffee, the group\\'s stimulant of choice.Musician Syd Straw unintentionally strikes truth when she sardonically asks about the film, \\'Is this more like a fluff piece?\\'It\\'s hard to go wrong with documentary subjects as articulate and intriguing as childhood friends John Flansburgh and John Linnell.As incessantly clever and coyly ironic as its subject\\'s music.If you thought that the party-down metalheads in The Decline of Western Civilization II were full of themselves, just wait until you enter the echo chamber of whimsical egomania that is alt-rock attitude.They easily impress with their brainy charms and the documentary surrounding them continually reminds us that it\\'s in on the joke as well.John and John, it cannot be denied, are charming, witty, adorable, and quite capable of rocking. Short on concrete evidence but long on compelling insinuation.Compulsively watchable and endlessly inventive as it transforms Broomfield\\'s limited materials into a compelling argument.You don\\'t need to know your Ice-T\\'s from your Cool-J\\'s to realize that as far as these shootings are concerned, something is rotten in the state of California.Broomfield turns his distinctive \\'blundering\\' style into something that could really help clear up the case.Broomfield\\'s style of journalism is hardly journalism at all, and even those with an avid interest in the subject will grow impatient.Most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and, no matter how Broomfield dresses it up, it tends to speculation, conspiracy theories or, at best, circumstantial evidence.Bristles with the sort of passion and bold purpose so often lacking in contemporary nonfiction filmmaking.It\\'s like a rap Rashomon. There\\'s a million different stories here.Nothing sticks, really, except a lingering creepiness one feels from being dragged through a sad, sordid universe of guns, drugs, avarice and damaged dreams.Journalistically dubious, inept and often lethally dull.[Broomfield] uncovers a story powerful enough to leave the screen sizzling with intrigue.Nick Broomfield\\'s dishonest film Biggie and Tupac solves nothing about the rap world\\'s most notorious murders.Whether or not you buy Mr. Broomfield\\'s findings, the film acquires an undeniable entertainment value as the slight, pale Mr. Broomfield continues to force himself on people and into situations that would make lesser men run for cover.The footage of the rappers at play and the prison interview with Suge Knight are just two of the elements that will grab you.A first-person whodunit in which the filmmaker casts himself as a seedy gumshoe poking around a hallucinatory world in which poverty, crime, and drugs mix with fantastic wealth and grandiose scenarios lifted from The Godfather and Scarface.In exploring their deaths, Broomfield sheds light on his subjects\\' lives and art, reminding us why their loss still reverberates and their albums still sell in the millions.Broomfield reveals an ironic manifestation of institutionalized slavery that ties a black-owned record label with a white-empowered police force.In general, the film is a series of Broomfield popping up Michael Moore-style, unannounced, and drilling the unsuspecting subjects with invasive and blunt questions.The fact is that the screen is most alive when it seems most likely that Broomfield\\'s interviewees, or even himself, will not be for much longer.A worthwhile documentary, whether you\\'re into rap or not, even if it may still leave you wanting more answers as the credits roll. Like watching a Polaroid picture develop without ever getting to see the finished picture.What it does well is place viewers at the heart of the frustration of failure, of the silence during pre-show strolls to get one\\'s mind focused, of the genesis of a promising joke.Charles did a great job of catching Seinfeld with his guard down, or what passes for unguarded for this most guarded of celebrities.Demonstrates that even good comics aren\\'t especially interesting when caught offstage.Seinfeld, dogged by self-doubt and clearly struggling at times, comes up with some fairly funny material.What begins as an indulgent vanity piece (Seinfeld was a producer of the film) ends up as a fascinating portrait of creativity at its most compulsive.A penetrating glimpse into the tissue-thin ego of the stand-up comic.It\\'s refreshing to see a celebrity documentary that isn\\'t focused on the celebrity, but on the art that made him who he is.It\\'s tough to sympathize with a man as wealthy and established as Seinfeld, but Comedian has an engaging rhythm, an immediacy that\\'s genuine and unvarnished, and a few great laughs.It\\'s a crafted look at the craft of comedy, and a picture with the good sense not to be too earnest about the subject of humour -- that is, you get to laugh a little while you learn a little more.At once emotional and richly analytical, the Cosby-Seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose, larky documentary.If you are at all interested in how stand-up sausage gets made, Comedian shows everything that goes into the grinder.Too bad Kramer couldn\\'t make a guest appearance to liven things up.There are no deep revelations, no shocking moments of truth, and many, many conversations in which Seinfeld and other comics discuss their acts with discouragement and despair.The comedian\\'s wavering insecurity is folded into the philosopher\\'s trademark uncertainty, and the movie, with artful deception, exposes its primary subject to be a deeply torn soul.A highly watchable documentary that follows the comedian\\'s attempt to develop new stage material.Mr. Adams seldom seems as funny as he thinks he is. But his blunt observations give the film its cutting edge.Seeing Seinfeld at home as he watches his own appearance on Letterman with a clinical eye reminds you that the key to stand-up is to always make it look easy, even though the reality is anything but.It takes us finally to the comedy clubs that for so many years we saw only at the beginning and end of Seinfeld.As lively an account as Seinfeld is deadpan. There\\'s no doubt that the film delivers the emotional equivalent of a kidney punch, but that\\'s as much a result of the filmmaker\\'s attitude-better suited to entomological research-as it is to the Friedmans themselves.While with any number of... documentaries one can happily say \"wait until it turns up on the small screen\", with Capturing the Friedmans it is well worth sitting in the dark to find out the extent to which you think you are being deliberately kept there.[][][]Without a doubt a disconcertingly engrossing, difficult-to-shake experience.Disturbing, yet undeniably fascinating.It takes the concept of reality television and twists it into a shocking but poignant art form.Watching this remarkable production is like going on safari to that creepy world. It\\'s a fascinating place to visit, but you wouldn\\'t, not for a minute, want to live there.The MPAA doesn\\'t have a rating for queasy-making and heartbreaking. If it did, then Capturing the Friedmans would carry an advisory.A documentary you won\\'t be able to shake.An experience you will never forget.A movie that will have you talking and thinking for hours.The year\\'s most compelling cinematic conversation piece.[]A disquieting documentary about a disturbing incident.A fascinating meditation on truth-telling, and on the flickering nature of memory.What the Osbournes are to farce, the Friedmans are to tragicomedy.Where so many \\'reality\\' shows shrink a subject down to snug, humiliating form, Friedmans takes the opposite approach.A prime candidate for a time capsule, to disclose a century hence the current state of some of our civilization\\'s discontents, including the ability to be convinced that one is telling the truth even when one is lying. [A] mesmerizing portrait of former U.S. Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara...Although Errol Morris\\'s film takes us through the nasty dramas behind various wars, few of McNamara\\'s clarifications come as a surprise.[]A fascinating look into the mind of one of 20th century America\\'s most controversial military figures[]An engrossing and illuminating documentary.Offers a couple of hours of brilliant clarity amid the noise and chaos.For those of my generation, the true resonance in the film may be in the constant juxtaposition between the then and the now of the McNamara life.Mesmerizing documentary.What\\'s genuinely suspenseful about the movie is its journey into the heart and mind of McNamara.A provocative case study in power and the powerful.Fascinating documentary about Robert S. McNamara.An insanely timely cautionary tale about American omniscience and the fallible belief that rationality will always win out.McNamara, a robust conversationalist, is so lively that he bursts out of what is essentially a talking-head documentary.Disturbing.A stethoscope on the heartbeat of history.Essentially McNamara\\'s version of himself through history, and he is such a persuasive figure.[Morris] gave him a stage -- and Mr. McNamara took it -- to chart the tragedy of Vietnam and prove that war is too complex, too dangerous for fallible human beings in power to know what they\\'re doing.Offers a fascinating history lesson -- and one you\\'ll probably never read in any book.The interviews were filmed a year before the war in Iraq. That so many of McNamara\\'s lessons have come into play imbue The Fog of War with an eerie clarity. Compelling and immediate.Fascinating, informative and chilling.A gripping, nearly perfect documentary, chronicling a heart-stopping rise, fall and triumphant reversal in the space of its 74-minute running time.Everything\\'s real -- the shouting, the dissonance, the worry.Stands as our best chance to understand what happened in Caracas, even if the filmmakers\\' pro-Chavez stance should send you to alternate sources for the larger picture.The Revolution Will Not Be Televised may be controversial, biased and patchy, but it contains some of the most electrifying and immediate nonfiction footage seen on the big screen.Amazing documentary.As gripping as any recent thriller.The Revolution Will Not Be Televised is an extraordinary piece of electronic history. And a riveting movie.An extraordinary inside look at politics at its most urgent, volatile and bare-knuckled.A fascinating look at events mostly unknown to outsiders.A gripping if necessarily disjointed documentary that plays like a real-life version of a Costa-Gavras thriller.Remarkable true-life footage makes this 74-minute film as potent as behemoths twice its size.An amazing record of what has been called history\\'s shortest-lived coup d\\'etat.What resonates in the end are the forces behind it, what it says about its time, and how, in fact, it ever happened at all.The crew of The Revolution Will Not Be Televised had been in the country for months before the coup, and their access and reporting are impressive.This is reality filmmaking -- a fascinating front-row seat for what could be history\\'s shortest-lived coup.More than a scary close-up look at the raw mechanics of a power grab, the film is also a cautionary examination of the use of television to deceive and manipulate the public.Bartley and O\\'Briain do an excellent job in deconstructing the Venezuelan TV news footage of blood, chaos, and rival crowds.It is remarkable because the filmmakers, Kim Bartley and Donnacha O\\'Briain, had access to virtually everything that happened within the palace during the entire episode. As pretty and light as a feather on the wind.[]In the tradition of the also nearly wordless Atlantis and Microcosmos?√† educational voiceover narration is superfluous: It\\'s enough simply to see.Winged Migration is a quite astounding feat of cinema.After seeing these natural wonders, the elaborate special effects of such films as The Hulk and The Matrix Reloaded will seem like cheap parlor tricks.The photography is radiant.As magnificent as it is perplexing.Flight as sheer freedom couldn\\'t be better demonstrated.A film that will leave you dreaming about what it would be like to step off the edge of the world and discover you could fly.A life-affirming story that\\'s enthralling, inspiring and poignant.It\\'s a beautiful and oddly restful experience.This is a movie to be seen and savored. And savored again.The movie offers ample amounts of power, poetry and even humor.A feat of diligence -- and not just on the part of its feathered subjects.It\\'s a heady, exultant ode to life.[]Winged Migration is, without question, the best documentary about birds I have ever seen.For those who dream of soaring with eagles -- or gliding with geese or hovering with herons -- the euphoric Winged Migration literally offers a bird\\'s-eye view of the world\\'s most majestic vistas.A fascinating motion picture.Whether we\\'re seeing a startled flock taking sudden flight or zapping into a mountain lake to catch fish, our eye is constantly bedazzled. The beauty of To Be And To Have is that Lopez\\'s loss isn\\'t the audience\\'s. This movie is a portal, leading to a living museum of childhood.[]The most unvarnished cinematic portrait of childhood I\\'ve ever seen.It demonstrates without overreaching what an actual teacher can do to shape lives.A counterintuitive film about a small schoolhouse in rural France, To Be and to Have gets its punch from simple scenes and conversations.To Be and to Have is a movie every teacher should see, and every parent, too.At times, it feels as stultifying as watching paint dry, without the recompense of sniffing fumes.[]Watchful viewers -- particularly those with fond memories of a favorite teacher -- will be deeply moved by this film.Amounts to a rare gift and an opportunity to appreciate the end of an era.Deep, honest and unforced.A deceptively simple French film about teaching that keeps enlarging as you watch it, becoming beautiful and inspiring in a way most films never touch.An unhurried model of nonfiction filmmaking and a vision of life at its most persuasively humanistic.To Be and To Have works in the grandest tradition of documentary filmmaking -- it keeps company with a small, specific place going about its business, and from it parses the whole world.Contains some of the most stirring footage I have ever seen on the act and art of teaching children.This heart-wrenching documentary about a French village schoolteacher at work offers the comedy and pathos of great drama and the visual magnificence of painting.Exhibiting the same sort of patience as his sensible hero, Philibert has created an extraordinarily humane portrait of a partnership between one adult and his very fortunate charges.So superb, so graceful, so strong -- another beauty in this year of good documentaries -- that I do believe it will influence career choices, sending inspired viewers to study pedagogy, or cinematography.To Be and to Have feels like a deep, sweet pull of spring water.One of the year\\'s most engaging films. [][]It captures a pure moment in time when musical hearts and minds beat as one, when musicians of all stripes came together to work and play hard and leave behind one damn fine-looking corpse.The road doc format\\'s nothing new, but it preserves such a brief, precious moment in rock history that it\\'ll have fans captivated.There are sterling concert performances by several bands in peak form.A delirious piece of pop ephemera, a time capsule set on the cusp between the Summer of Love and the Day the Music Died.What\\'s most revealing and human about Festival Express are its candid looks at artists bonding aboard the choo-choo.It\\'s the overnight jam sessions that steal the show.Here\\'s a chance to listen to the soundtrack for the social upheaval of the late \\'60s and early \\'70s.A treasure for baby-boomer rockers and a miniature history lesson for younger music fans.This is the film\\'s most interesting angle: the tension that arises as rabble-rousers fight with cops and rail against the promoters who dared to charge $16 for a daylong concert.The musical performances are the heart of the movie and it\\'s a toss-up whether the spontaneous jams captured on the train or the classic acts on stage are more thrilling.A fascinating time capsule of unseen moments from the 1960s, both the musical ... and the sociological as the cream of the musical counterculture comes face to face with its own greedy, bullying fans.The result is satisfying, anchored by wonderful performances, including an aching rendition of Bob Dylan\\'s \\'I Shall Be Released\\' with Manuel singing and Guy\\'s smoking-hot version of \\'Money.\\'The musical highlights are many, from The Band working through a rousing \\'Slippin\\' & Slidin\\'\\' to Buddy Guy jumping off the stage for a blasting guitar solo in the middle of \\'Money.\\'It emerges as one of the last howls of defiance from the counter-culture decade, made all the more poignant by the fact that many of those involved are no longer around to remember it.A fascinating, fly-on- the-wall (or fly-in-the- dining-car) glimpse of some clearly blotto rock legends talking, singing, hanging out.It is a rough jewel unearthed, and if you care at all about the era, it will shine for you.Proves less a revelation than a confirmation that these performers -- who are joined on various stops by bluesman Buddy Guy, Ian and Sylvia\\'s post-folkie incarnation as Great Speckled Bird, and others -- were everything they were cracked up to be.One of the great rock \\'n\\' roll movies, a treasure trove of music and a wildly entertaining chronicle of a vanished time. Building an indictment of the media, the police, and the provincial governor for placing self-interest above saving lives, Bus 174 opens out from the people directly involved in the incident to an examination of institutionalized poverty.A tense documentary with multiple layers of meaning.Padilha allows neither easy answers nor ironic commentary, producing on both sides of the conflict a world of inconsolable grief.Slightly overlong for overseas audiences, Jos?? Padilha\\'s film (co-directed by editor Felipe Lacerda) makes it crystal clear why this incident proved so traumatic for many Brazilians.Masterful.If City Of God cracked the skin, Bus 174 digs deep into the wound. An astounding, depressing triumph.A stunning indictment of Brazil\\'s social meltdown, this startling documentary plays like City Of God -- except this time the bullets are real.This smart, absorbing movie, which has been sharply edited by Felipe Lacerda, never feels like it\\'s spreading itself too thin.An extraordinary portrait of a life lived always in the shadow of despair.In a city that continually hides its social problems among the shadows, it\\'s inevitable that the surest light to reveal them would come from a muzzle flash.Interviews, images and events accumulate, driving the story to its sad end with the implacable momentum of a Greek tragedy.Padhila\\'s carefully assembled documentary has the fascination of a car wreck -- only any number of social themes ripple through this real drama.A fluid and forceful indictment of a culture of neglect.It shows us the spectacle of what happened while explaining the many factors why. It is extraordinary in the way it balances the sensational with the sensible.The movie brilliantly uses this intense narrative as a platform from which to observe some of the deeper flaws in Brazilian culture.What starts off as a documentary about a hostage crisis in Rio de Janeiro deepens with every passing minute. By the end, you realize you\\'ve seen an extraordinary movie, easily one of the best of the year.This is patient filmmaking, trading sensationalism for the rewards of investigation.It operates as a multi-pronged critique of a society in which the media, the police, the state and public itself are implicated in precisely the kind of violence that gripped the nation of Brazil that day.Padilha does much more than just present a hostage situation. He hunts down people who knew Nascimento and reconstructs his tortured life.It is Padilha\\'s sensitivity, thoroughness, persistence and artful assembly of all the angles on this story that gets us heart-wrenchingly close to understanding the \\'why.\\' A definitive statement about how the movies have distorted our perceptions of this city\\'s architectural, cultural and historical identity ..Blends a complex kaleidoscopic portrait of the city and a powerful work of film criticism with Andersen\\'s personal story of living in Los Angeles.Andersen\\'s inspired ruminations about his city as a filming location and as a repository for other filmmakers\\' daydreams and nightmares.One of the great films of the century to date, poignant and affecting.CalArts professor Thom Andersen poured a lifetime of moviegoing (and his own complex affection for the city he calls home) into this revelatory two-part documentary, a film that trains you to look at things askew.[]Using well-chosen clips from roughly 200 films, many of them obscure, Andersen makes a powerful and impassioned case for reassessing his beloved city.It\\'s like being squired through town by a wisecracking cabbie with a PhD in semiotics.Brilliantly discursive, filled with intriguing detours that follow connections only the director\\'s mind could make, Los Angeles Plays Itself, will please natives of this city more than any other.Watching this film is like spending an evening with a prickly, opinionated, thoughtful cineaste friend -- one who has a vast stock of DVDs at the ready.The film creates a revolutionary lens through which the movies\\' relationship to Los Angeles will never look the same.An intellectually rigorous but enjoyable essay on the way the city of angels has become Hollywood\\'s favourite location.Absorbing and revelatory, this is film criticism of the highest order.Required DVD viewing for anyone interested in the cinema of L.A. -- its \\'look,\\' its politics, its lies (both artistic and inartistic) -- as well as for the director\\'s pervasively judgmental tone.A terrific cinematic essay that will have a very, very long shelf life.Andersen\\'s key accomplishment is to profoundly alter the viewer\\'s assumptions of what is good in movies.I think [Andersen\\'s] attitude is prudish, even a bit loopy, yet maybe it took a cracked Los Angeles fetishist to make a chronicle of pop geography as obsessively entertaining as this one.What Andersen does best is capture the sense of growing up and living among the landmarks of Hollywood\\'s authentic back lot.Los Angeles Plays Itself, Alexander\\'s sprawling and incisive meditation on the many uses and abuses of the city of L.A. in the movies, may be the unlikeliest great movie of the year.Alas, Andersen -- a longtime academic -- often says far too much, and in typically stultifying, grad- school language. Anyone who thinks making movies is easy needs to see this hilariously painful cautionary tale. It\\'s a tribute to Gilliam that he never once took off his mike or asked the filmmakers to stop rolling.[]Wondrous document of a film gone wrong and an artist who inspires fans, cast and crew, even as he terrifies financiers, insurers and anyone more firmly footed in filmmaking reality.A fascinating record of how the movie fell apart, piece by piece, with everything short of a natural disaster conspiring against the filmmaker.A fascinating study in the cinematic arts, as we watch a talented director and a committed crew and cast thwarted by nature, human failings and just plain bad luck.[]Gilliam himself is a joy to behold. His wit stays sharp even as his fortunes dull, and the conditions that conspire against him only prove the mettle in our man of La Mancha.Should be required viewing for all film-school students, aspiring filmmakers and studio suits.Bitterly funny and oddly poignant.One hopes that some day Gilliam gets to realize his dream, but in the meantime, in Lost In La Mancha, the shards of that dream offer tantalizing -- and tear-inducing -- glimpses of what might have been.I\\'d like Lost in La Mancha more if it didn\\'t take the easy but misleading route of dovetailing Gilliam\\'s frustrations into Welles\\'s, and then dovetailing both into Quixote\\'s.It\\'s disconcerting to recommend this movie for its entertainment value, but highly watchable it is.A fascinating chronicle of bad luck, bad faith and bad weather all striking on the same day.Entertaining documentary about how badly everything went.A fascinating glimpse at the fragile ecosystem of a movie shoot, but I\\'m bound to say that I don\\'t share its view of Gilliam.Some films end with a whimper; this one banged into a stone wall.[Works best] as an entry in the genre of Hollywood schadenfreude pioneered by the 1991 Apocalypse Now documentary Hearts of Darkness.You can interpret Lost in La Mancha as a sort of triumph of the creative spirit.Does exactly what it sets out to do, describing the picture Gilliam was hoping to make and showing just how wrong it went. But it\\'s also an elegy for every doomed picture that was never made.The filmmakers, Louis Pepe and Keith Fulton, get perilously close to the glitches and backbiting, the mad logistical frustrations that derailed Gilliam\\'s Quixote. Stevie is a tough movie to watch and an even tougher one to leave, because once you\\'re involved you\\'re implicated.[][]A spectacle of suffering and liberal guilt.A powerful chronicle of a human life.A haunting documentary/ personal essay that provokes violently mixed feelings toward both subject and filmmaker.Filmmaker James -- whose wife is a social worker -- should be applauded for his courage and commitment.The road of Stevie is a rough ride, and at 145 minutes, it\\'s a long one. But in an age of so-called reality shows that are no more than hyped entertainment, it is a rewarding if distressing look at flawed but genuine human beings.Stevie is a fascinating, irritating movie, with a portrait of a hopelessly troubled young man at its center.Bring Kleenex.For all Stevie implies about the guilt, contradictions and confused motivations of its filmmaker, at bottom it is a deeply humane and touching experience.While ostensibly about how the System failed Stevie, this documentary is, of course, really about James who frets, ad nauseam, about his own motives in imposing himself on Stevie and his dysfunctional family.A remarkable and profoundly sad experience.Despite good reviews at this year\\'s Sundance Film Festival, this is the kind of squishy lost cause that gives liberal guilt a bad name.Stevie is worth seeing for its provocative originality, and the debates it is bound to raise.[A] special documentary.Of course, James is exploiting Stevie, but the peculiar power of this film lies in James\\' indirect acknowledgment of it and his hope that his film has some point and value.If James and his crew can spend years with these blighted souls, surely you can spend two hours with them, exploring compassion\\'s outer limits.Stevie is gripping in its intimacy.Overly long and uncomfortably intrusive, but never less than compelling. Von Trier\\'s antic documentary The Five Obstructions...comically reveals the Dogmatist at his torturous worst while tapping into appealing depths of insecurity he\\'s never allowed himself.[...]The reason The Five Obstructions lingers as an essential part of von Trier\\'s filmography [...] is because it reveals so much about why von Trier has worked the way he has in the past [...][]Fascinating (and oft-times infuriating).Riveting.It\\'s amusing only if you agree not to think very much about it.A film like this has a limited audience, I suppose, but for that audience it offers a rare fascination.For those who treasure not only watching the intricate challenges of filmmaking but also feeling the thrill of tomfoolery and sharing the demonic joy of psychological twists, Obstructions is enthralling.The relationship between the two filmmakers raises it above the category of academic experiment. Von Trier brings a diabolical glee to his role, and Leth matches it with an older, wiser brand of mischief.In this enjoyable if trivial battle between von Trier\\'s psychodrama theatricality and Leth\\'s cool formalism, it\\'s ultimately the viewer who comes out the winner.Part of what hooks you to this movie is how Leth outsmarts his taskmaster, and how the two men have divergent, almost incompatible aesthetic ideals.In only 90 minutes it encourages you to reexamine the nature of cinema, the sources of creativity, the unexpected joys of the unanticipated moment. And it couldn\\'t be more fun to watch.A special auteurist treat that\\'s easier to enjoy than to describe or categorize.A movie that\\'s so eager and playful and inspired that it made me a von Trier believer again.It\\'s a game of cinematic Survivor that takes on broader meaning, exploring film as a mode of self-expression and the latent insecurity that drives artists to deliver works of greatness.Leth leaves the viewer both exhilarated and maybe even optimistic about the capacity of human intelligence and creativity.Watching The Five Obstructions is at once like witnessing two chess masters playing dominoes and like spying on a series of therapy sessions.An essay on art as a matter of solving problems posed by a capricious deity -- that is, an expos of von Trier\\'s own method, both of making a movie and directing actors.Leth is hypnotically unstoppable.The success of the film depends almost distressingly on the audience\\'s cheeky sense of bad faith toward Lars Von Trier. It is pretty convincing in its argument that China has every intention of destroying the culture of Tibetans.Harrowing and illuminating.Makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of a people that the world must never be allowed to forget, no matter how much their oppressors would prefer us to do just that.A passionate work of advocacy documentary.A sobering examination of a land in turmoil and a people that have faced what former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Jeanne Kirkpatrick cites as 20 years of ethnic cleansing.A colorful but grimly efficient documentary about a culture under siege.Each revelation seems more disturbing than the next.[]Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion is not just well-intentioned, it\\'s admirably well-intentioned. Its intentions are so good they sparkle... The only problem is, that sort of stuff doesn\\'t always make for the most fascinating movie.Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion will make even the most apolitical viewers want to hoist their own Free Tibet banners.Such a measured primer of talking heads and footage -- a broad, slick Tibet 101 -- that it seems better suited to the classroom than the big screen, despite its Himalayan scenery and rustic colors.It\\'s a rare glimpse of China\\'s \\'final solution\\' for a courageous people whose world view is one of forgiveness, nonviolence and love.Focuses too much on what we know and not enough on what we don\\'t.If Richard Gere annoys you, ignore him and the other celebrities mentioned here and learn something.It\\'s a factual movie, but it winds up speaking loudly to the heart.A fascinating and reasonably comprehensive portrait.Cry of the Snow Lion succeeds in making a viewer want to do more, but it\\'s scattershot enough to make you want to know more too.Documentaries can be informative, entertaining and provocative, but rare is the documentary that makes you feel so engaged (and enraged) that it prompts you to action somehow. Tibet: Cry of the Snow Lion is that kind of film.Part political thriller, part National Geographic travelogue, Tom Peosay\\'s documentary is a distressing look at China\\'s 50-year repression of the people of Tibet.[An] unabashedly heart-tugging documentary. Dullaghan uncovers the human being behind the myth, thanks again to old footage.An amazing, worthy journey.Provides an overview of Bukowski\\'s work and allows us to gaze into the soul of a man who built a fortress of toughness around his vulnerable core.The filmmaker knows when to shift the rhythm of his investigation. The authenticity of art is woven with the artifice of life.Over a period of seven years, Dullaghan interviewed hundreds of people who knew or were affected by Bukowski. The result is both wide-ranging and intimate.How much was legend, how much was pose, how much was real? I think it was all real, and the documentary suggests as much.Dullaghan\\'s raw and defining documentary about the man -- and the myth.A portrait of a sometimes surly, often foulmouthed, always brilliant artist that is at once humane, horrific, hilarious and deeply moving.It is wide-ranging, it is fair, it is thorough, and although it admires, it is also tough enough to condemn.A great documentary about a fine writer and horrible human being.It reveals Bukowski to be a far grander artist than his bum\\'s armor would suggest.As a thorough examination of what made this boozing, brawling womanizer tick, Born Into This can\\'t be beat.Without straining, this definitive, deeply engrossing film biography makes a strong case for Charles Bukowski as a major American poet.Speaks for the idolaters without apology. Yet it maintains just enough level-headedness to show the darker, not-so-admirable aspects of the Bukowski legend.Charles Bukowski, the bard of post-war L.A.\\'s working-class underbelly, was no ordinary cult writer, and John Dullaghan\\'s thorough, compelling doc Bukowski: Born Into This does a credible job of showing why.Its power springs from the director\\'s shifting between fawning stories from long-time acquaintances and the scraggly, take-it-or-leave-it surliness of Bukowski himself.\\'Poet laureate of the gutter,\\' ranter, sexual boaster, bane of the middle class and lifelong outcast, the writer cultivated a persona that begs for documentary treatment, and he gets a good one in Bukowski: Born Into This.You come out of the theater wanting to beeline to a bookstore, grab a copy of Post Office or Love Is a Dog From Hell, and adjust your opinion as necessary.Accomplishes beautifully what it sets out to do, which is to reveal the man behind the crusty, hard-drinking, tough-talking persona Charles Bukowski so artfully crafted.Dullaghan\\'s thrilling documentary about the life and times of Charles Bukowski is the stuff that legends are made of. It\\'s rare enough when a documentary achieves cult status. Rarer still when it actually changes lives. The Stone Reader, a movie about the love of reading, manages to do both.You\\'re not likely to see a more impassioned and heartfelt tribute to the joy of reading.Loved the discovery, but hated the man\\'s forcing of himself on the project.It\\'s an intimate look at the gears inside one person\\'s head and a study of how an obsession, when handled judiciously, can be enlightening.Fascinating and compulsively watchable.Moskowitz has made a wonderful film about readers and reading, writers and writing.Moskowitz may soon find himself in the same boat as many of the artists he is analyzing, because Stone Reader is going to be one tough act to follow.It\\'s a tribute to the transforming power of reading and a reminder of the Sisyphean task that reading can be.For a film that\\'s obsessed with a book, it\\'s amazing how little we learn about it. Nevertheless, we walk out of the theater longing to get our hands on it.Enormously affectionate, gloriously self-indulgent and unhesitatingly heroic in its championing of good books.Occasionally overwrought and overwritten.A decent, diverting movie.It should delight anyone who loves to curl up with a book, or loves to tell someone about a book worth curling up with.The stultifying pace and Moskowitz\\'s filmmaking laziness are forgivable, but it\\'s exasperating and indicative of our low expectations for the documentary form that a film that taps the likes of Leslie Fiedler could be so devoid of ideas.To anyone whose soul lives or dies by reading or writing or both, the movie is a total thrill.Both an involving real-life mystery and a passionate romance between a novelist and his ideal reader.Moskowitz indulgences himself too often at the expense of audience patience.Filmmaker Mark Moskowitz, who earns a living making political commercials, turns his considerable skills of media persuasion to the nobler service of selling serious books. And with Stone Reader, he makes the sale.An unalloyed treasure for any viewer who has ever felt transformed by reading a good novel.What Stone Reader offers that\\'s new is its portrayal of reading not as a supremely civilized and soulful activity but as a lonely, thwarting and sometimes painfully embarrassing one. Some of it-by musicians, scholars, dissidents, former guerrillas, retired riot cops-is fascinating, some vainglorious.Filmed performances, archive footage, and some evocative reminiscences from legendary singers and actors such as Miriam Makeba, Vusi Mahlasela and Sibongile Khumalo bring the period back to life.[][][]This is powerful stuff, presented unblinkingly and yet with rousing ardour.The power of voices raised together comes through with a clear elation that\\'s undeniable, and in the end Amandla! makes you want to sing.Like going to the lecture of an impassioned but really disorganized professor. You exit class flipping through your notes and have no idea what most of them mean.A documentary that is as thoughtful and inspiring as the music it celebrates.The sound of liberation, set to the beat of human destiny.A pleasure -- musically, intellectually and emotionally.Whatever Amandla! lacks in cohesion is made up by the passion of those who lived through apartheid, and the power of their defiant, sad and joyous sounds.Viewers will leave Amandla! moved by the music, impressed by the musicians and dubious about the possibility of political and social healing.What songs, what people and what a triumph that their music won in the end.Music was the ANC\\'s most dangerous weapon, and we see footage of streets lined with tens of thousands of marchers, singing and dancing, expressing an unquenchable spirit.It leaves you stirred and uplifted not only by its music but also by the determination and courage of the people who sang and danced it on the way to a freer life.A great documentary that makes your heart leap with joy.A beautiful movie about the power of music, about the power of being right.Johanna Demetrakas\\' editing is magnificent at orchestrating and balancing potentially conflicting moods to build a consistent tone all the movie\\'s own.Talking heads outnumber performing heads by a roughly 3-to-1 ratio. All about the sights, which are glorious.[Brown] collects some fascinating stories.An awe-inspiring survey of global surf culture.Absolutely unlike any documentary you\\'ve ever seen, Step Into Liquid nearly qualifies as a religious experience.When Step Into Liquid remembers that it is indeed all about the wave, it pulls us right into it.In any sport, whether it\\'s whacking a ball into a cup or your opponent into submission, the majestic and the absurd are very close cousins, and Brown is generous enough here to give us a long look at both.Step Into Liquid could very well be the perfect surfing movie.Step Into Liquid delivers eye-popping shots pumped up by the genuine cowabunga enthusiasm of true believers. By the end all you want to do is get in the water.Step into Liquid is for extreme sports fans, for sure. But its appeal is wide enough to leave this mild-mannered movie critic itching to catch a wave someday.The undisputed surf-film champion.The spectacular photography, smart editing and pounding score is so hypnotic, it\\'s a shock to come out of the theater and step onto concrete.Truly like a day at the beach.While Step Into Liquid has charming and even breathtaking moments, it definitely flags after the halfway point.Brown\\'s premise is that surfing is fun anywhere, and his film celebrates that idea and showcases the spectacular moves and wrecks that are an integral part of any surf movie.Serves up enough action and passion to stay afloat, but at the end of the day it\\'s just not the perfect ride those earlier films were.Because it gets so close to the real thing, the film does a good job of letting even the most hopelessly landlocked viewers experience vicariously the unique allure and adrenaline rush of being one with a surging 60-foot wall of water.This is pretty much a feel-good film for committed fans and moviegoers looking for some spectacular combination of travelogue, athleticism and slo-mo grace.Part of the appeal is the underlying theme of the torch being passed between generations.With neo-rock replacing beach boyisms and new optical technology permitting crisp Steadicam close-ups of ballet-like aquabatics, Step into Liquid is state-of-the-art non-art.Brown goes off in search of those who surf only because they love it. And this takes him to some unexpected places. Cameron reconstructs life aboard in the shape of living tableaux of passengers and crew, seen in spectral mode, eating, drinking, dancing or promenading among the watery remnants of their vessel. It is done with finesse and, oddly, is deeply touching.If you see only one James Cameron-directed movie about theTitanic -and you should - see the one that doesn\\'t star Kate and Leo.This hour-long feature, edited down from 900 hours of footage, is both a technical marvel and a heartfelt memorial to those who died when the ship sank in 1912.Despite Paxton\\'s whooping every time a new artefact comes on screen, it\\'s hard to be constantly excited about watching a bunch of rusty, decayed junk -- historic and three-dimensional though it may be.It may not have the organisation of \\'art\\', but it\\'s quite some postcard.Granted, if I\\'d made a film that grossed more than $600 million in the U.S. and walked away with 11 Academy Awards, I\\'d probably be a bit slow on the upbeat myself.Cameron, who produced and directed it, does a visually splendid job, though what he has fashioned comes down to a logistical footnote to his great, primal, heart-of- the-ocean blockbuster.One of the rare Imax movies in which the 3-D effects are completely melded into the picture, rather than simply used as a gimmick.A great experience for Titanic buffs.Do we really need to see Cameron and his team of scientists blown up to such nauseating proportions?Might as well be titled: James Cameron: What I Did On My Holidays.Aside from his CGI ghostcraft unwittingly co-opting Pat O\\'Neill\\'s last feature, Cameron is entirely predictable in a marines T-shirt, exhorting, \\'Next stop, Titanic -- rock \\'n\\' roll!\\'Ghosts of the Abyss is an incredible experience that will further enhance our century-long fascination with the Titanic.An educational outing, shedding light on a deep, dark place most of us have only imagined.Besides the considerable technological magic of the film, it\\'s blessedly done without a spirit of vanity.The footage from the dives shows perfectly preserved details from the inside of the ship.A mesmerizing journey, made all the more immediate by its reach-out-and- touch-it 3-D.A lot like a theme-park ride: occasionally exciting but carefully controlled.Documentary dramatizations usually are awful, but in Ghosts of the Abyss, they work.The remarkable 3-D photography, which adds amazing depth and detail to the projected image, makes even the pointless passages absorbing. It\\'s fascinating to see the process by which skateboarding, in all its concrete grittiness, was transformed into a mainstream activity of consumer cool.An exhilarating and terrifying journey through youth-culture hell.Thoroughly compelling documentary.The movie fails to pull off all its trick moves.You can see why Stickler was drawn to the charismatic Gator, but his story is so extreme (he is serving life for murder) that it effectively unbalances the project.Consistently throughout the film, Stickler skates right over the crux of the matter.Packed to the rafters with fine old competition footage and clips from Vision\\'s wildly popular skateboarding videos, but it\\'s Gator\\'s imprisoned voice ... that lends the film its most tragic overtones.Offers a fascinating look into the skater\\'s tumble from grace, as well as chronicling the renaissance of his rebel sport.Even when sketched in broad terms, Rogowski\\'s downward spiral makes for compelling viewing, and to her credit, director Stickler never romanticizes her subject.By focusing on the self-immolation of the thoroughly despicable skateboarding star Mark \"Gator\" Rogowski, Stoked makes us all question the eternal chase for popularity and acceptance that takes up so much of daily life.[An] unflinching documentary.Gives us a succinct sense of an entire youth culture and the marketing of a fleeting mini-legend.Despite Stickler\\'s best efforts at putting his crimes into psychological and sociocultural context, Gator never emerges as anything but a blatant and outspoken -- and virulently brutal -- jerk.The calculus of a craze\\'s honest genesis, heady peak, exploitation, and burnout is so familiar by now as to be numbing, but Stoked makes it fresh because it has the primary sources at hand.Archival footage and interviews with contemporaries round out the rest of the film, illustrating Gator\\'s life without really illuminating it.The rise and fall of a pop-culture hero seems hardly noteworthy these days, yet Helen Stickler\\'s documentary Stoked: The Rise and Fall of Gator resonates, with a tale so dark it\\'s difficult to shake.Excels as both a tragedy and a celebration of skateboarding, showing how mass marketing legitimized the sport while fueling Gator\\'s demise.A story that is unexpectedly poignant even though it\\'s told to an insistent punk rock beat.An account of an entire generation\\'s loss of innocence -- a more streetwise variant on Stacy Peralta\\'s fine Dogtown and Z-Boys.Works effectively as a comprehensive biopic and as a cautionary tale, with wider applications, about the dangers of going too far too fast. It\\'d be easy to write off Paramount\\'s Tupac: Resurrection as a cheap publicity stunt.Gripping documentary, see it with your teens.A dishearteningly incomplete portrait.[][]A revelation.It\\'s amazing stuff.Lazin\\'s documentary may be somewhat one-sided -- Afeni Shakur\\'s involvement guaranteed that -- but it\\'s still immensely enlightening, and a genuine gift to Tupac\\'s fans.It never addresses the problem that the more Tupac opens his mouth to explain what his music is or isn\\'t about, and what role in society it is or isn\\'t supposed to serve, the more obvious it becomes that his views aren\\'t reflected in the actual music.It\\'s great to hear a person no longer with us captured so bountifully in interviews, talking and even bubbling about his friends, his legacy and his scrapes.[An] absorbing experience.While Tupac: Resurrection includes some never-before- seen family photos and performance footage, and excerpts from the late rapper\\'s journals, it offers little in the way of new information or insight into the rapper\\'s world.Fans, of course, will devour this film, but there\\'s plenty to chew on for the uninitiated as well.As poignant as it is informative.Intriguing but ultimately frustrating.A story of violence, and it\\'s superbly told.A strong film, with some genuinely revealing insights into the life of its charismatic and paradoxical subject.A captivating movie worth seeing.The movie is like an extra-strength episode of MTV\\'s Diary, which is like A&E Biography in the first person.An open-ended, honest portrait of a hugely talented young man. Fascinating documentary for mature older teens+.[]The optimistic viewer will see in all this blunt and messy contrariness the emergence of the first free press in the Arab world.Given that most Americans know the network only by reputation, or via Donald Rumsfeld\\'s public denunciations of it, a little more objective information would not have gone amiss.Noujaim\\'s documentary is clearly sympathetic to the journalists of Al-Jazeera, who all seem to be professional, intelligent and reasonable, but it is not blindly biased.Modest in scope and not as well structured as it could have been, Control Room may not seem all that compelling 10 years down the road. But right now, at this very moment, it is essential, imperative viewing.More illuminating than not, and shines its brightest light on a truth that war and warmongers so ferociously ignore: Look hard into the other\\'s camp and what you\\'ll likely see is yourself.A perceptive picture of the way in which modern warfare has turned the information battle into its permanent second front.Noujaim\\'s eye-opening documentary consistently asks the tough questions, while giving its subjects (and, implicitly, the audience) a remarkable forum for discussion.Americans watch CNN. The Arab world watches Al-Jazeera. This movie watches both and helps us understand how no attempt or pretense of objectivity can ever escape bias.Enlightening, if structurally relaxed documentary.This engrossing portrait of competing notions of truth is at once a thrilling real-time chronicle of the birth of a free press and a sophisticated philosophical treatise on the nature of objective reality.It does a good job of showing just how much media manipulation is taken for granted by those who have the job of massaging the facts and the ones who simply lie back and enjoy it.The value in Control Room is simply that it shows what America never got to see while also serving as a reminder that nobody serves up the real truth, everybody just serves up their truth.A glimpse of a world where everything is reversed, where our most cherished preconceptions are called into question and reality proves to be a more complex business than we imagined.... a raw, unblinking examination of how the first draft of history is revised by those who filter it.Control Room should be required viewing for anyone within reach of a TV signal.For those who are interested in wartime truth, this film reminds us that the casualty has been somewhat reduced.Without being didactic, the documentary raises important issues about bias and objectivity.A must-see movie. Zana Briski and Ross Kauffman\\'s Born Into Brothels is both sustained and ultimately sunk by its lofty intentions.[]Briski doesn\\'t merely document the children\\'s milieu. Instead, she does something revolutionary: She empowers them to document it for themselves.A devastating portrait of impoverished Calcutta children who are born into the sex trades, yet the film is also an inspiring document about human possibilities and the need to strive despite impossible odds.One feels manipulated rather than enlightened.A beautifully made essay on a filmmaker\\'s efforts to teach the children of Calcutta\\'s prostitutes the fine art of photography.The film says all it needs to say through the photos of the kids and their excited, wide-eyed reactions when they realize the outside world is paying attention to them.Born Into Brothels is great humanitarianism, but it\\'s not great filmmaking.Beautifully filmed, and devoid of the kind of patronizing beneficence that First Worlders often bring to the Third World.This is a film about our world that deserves the attention and the audience that Michael Moore\\'s films command.[]Heartwarming, heartbreaking and, finally, deeply haunting.Born of genuine research and a desire to shine light into the darkness, as all great documentaries must.Meeting these young people reminds us that victimized children can be reached, maybe because they\\'re too young to see themselves as victims.A success, though it is flat in its pacing and a bit self-congratulatory in awkward moments.Heroism can come in subtle forms. This is one of them.The drama lies in watching [the children\\'s] artistic educations sharpen their sense of self, change the way they observe the world, and affect their painful, squalid environment.The movie is a record by well-meaning people who try to make a difference for the better, and succeed to a small degree while all around them the horror continues unaffected.It\\'s beautifully photographed and, thanks to its subject matter, sometimes intensely moving.This low-tech, buoyant, yet often heartbreaking film is miracle enough on its own terms, full of surprises and tragic reminders that many kids are robbed of their dreams and promise by exploitative forces. Plagues and Pleasures has a different style for a reason: It\\'s a movie about the environment that isn\\'t content with the good-bad dynamic of your average gloomy enviropic.John Waters\\' dry narration suits the surreal, comic material.While the doc flounders as a coherent story of human folly, it\\'s a cheeky travelmercial guaranteed to get the curious to make the road trip to this near-abandoned resort.It makes for a strange, but somewhat endearing, melange of the grim and comic.The movie is engaging for the way it documents the rise and fall of a semi-natural landmark, and especially for the way it shows how people still come to California to remake themselves.Plagues and Pleasures is simultaneously fun and creepy, best appreciated by those who enjoy similar profiles of Detroit\\'s crumbling grandeur.Narrated with morbid relish by John Waters, this witty doc chronicles the rise and ruination of the Salton Sea, a tiny inland ocean once promoted as \\'California\\'s Riviera\\' but now a festering, apocalyptically hideous ecological disaster zone.As documentary subjects go, the Salton Sea was ripe for the plucking: This man-made phenomenon is one of the weirdest stories of the West.Chris Metzler and Jeff Springer found a strange place -- in California, of all places -- and made a video postcard about its colorful denizens and ecological calamity.[An] occasionally lighthearted but always affecting cautionary tale.This is a startlingly funny portrait of Gothic Americana.If it\\'s not likely to send you scurrying off to the place on your next vacation, it\\'s still a fascinating, nutty story, a kind of Chinatown gone wrong (or gone more wrong ).Takes a light-and-lively approach to the local population, consisting of transplanted oddballs and stubborn survivors drawn to the Sea\\'s calm, sunny environs and isolated, crime-free lifestyle.An often-fascinating document of change -- incremental as evaporation, or catastrophic as flooding.Jaunty and fun for a while, with a cast of colorful locals who make the residents of Vernon, Florida seem normal, pic ultimately overstays its welcome and overstates its case.Although the lake may be slowly dying, it is still beloved by a motley bunch of eccentrics who are profiled in the highly entertaining documentary Plagues and Pleasures on the Salton Sea.California dreaming meets good old American eccentricity and ecological emergency in the story of the Salton Sea. For all the film\\'s lecturing about the rise in diabetes and good and bad fats, you suspect that its director is secretly just having a laugh with the whole thing.Fascinating documentary on American fast food.Might help shake the Mcfaithful out of their special sauce stupors.It\\'s the film and its hero\\'s honest approach that make the package so persuasive.Super Size Me is, on one level, a cinematic stunt in the tradition of Michael Moore\\'s populist, anti-corporate crusades.Consumption will lead to possible nausea and certain amusement.A wonderful achievement -- entertaining, engrossing, and never far from grossing out.As entertaining as Super Size Me sometimes is, I\\'m not sure what Spurlock\\'s escapade really accomplishes, except to emphasize that eating 5,000 calories a day, and exercising little, is bad for you.A well-crafted comedy.Entertaining and informative.Although Spurlock\\'s movie is thought-provoking and downright funny, he doesn\\'t exactly play fair.Super Size Me can be frivolous and slightly smug, but it certainly puts the question of America\\'s health squarely on the table -- and in a wonderfully entertaining way.[]It\\'s one thing to know that fast food is bad for you. It\\'s another to see that \\'badness\\' demonstrated.After seeing this movie, it\\'s hard to think about fast food the same way again.Funny, sickening, scary, entertaining and undeniably educational.Blatantly unfair and completely winning documentary.A gimmick film that uses an upbeat style to create laughs, and, in truth, a distaste for fast food.Those who see the film will think twice before succumbing to that next Big Mac attack.What makes all this work is that the charming Mr. Spurlock, unlike combative Michael Moore, is winning, witty and completely at ease before the camera. Exudes a subtle spiritual power.As unique as the title animal: unrushed as a donkey, shaggy as a llama, sturdy as a horse ?√π and, it turns out, with a sensitive soft spot for music. Who\\'d\\'a thunk?Chances are, if you\\'re susceptible to this movie\\'s gentle charms, you\\'ll weep when the camel does.The characters are charming, the colours of the carpets in their yurts colourful and the emphasis on family inescapable.A simple and radiant piece of humanism.An astonishing, mesmerizing film about a vanishing way of lifeAn unusual film that is part ethnographic documentary and part narrative film.While it isn\\'t always easy to get used to the slower natural rhythms this film celebrates, its cumulative effect is undeniable.A film of simple rigor and heartfelt emotion.The most sincere and heartfelt camel movie in years, maybe ever.A beautiful and delicate reminder of the myriad ways in which life is lived on this huge planet of ours.Quietly moving.With its emphasis on harmony and its implied criticism of the decadence of consumerist society, this study of tradition is a rewarding experience.A cinematic oasis, both refreshing and thoroughly life-affirming.A window on a changing world most of us will never see.Whether this is filmmaking or recording is always up for debate; that it\\'s fascinating isn\\'t.A modest pleasure - a quiet little oasis in the blockbuster desert.Like Himalaya, Weeping Camel essentially lets native people tell their own unforgettable story.Strangely moving film.Transcends genre to become a deeply affecting allegory about the importance of patience and acceptance. [][]An exhilaratingly brilliant film about the rise and rise of the punk band that was too tough to die.A deliriously musical portrait of a band that became famous and legendary without the headlining stardom that usually accompanies that.A comprehensive look at the punk pioneers that never wears out its welcome.The revelations may even deepen your appreciation for the music -- it\\'s incredible that so much dumb fun was generated out of such pain.A film that does a fine job explaining their importance without airbrushing their foibles.A satisfying, straightforward documentary with great archive footage and interviews with band members ... and those they influenced.Engaging documentary.The directors have assembled a veritable sonic museum of the band.[A] compelling film.Offers a fascinating chronicle of the birth, glory days and waning years of a motorcycle-jacketed, bowl-haircutted quartet of middle-class geeks who unwittingly spawned the punk movement.A rough-hewn jewel of a documentary that chronicles the rise, demise and troublesome personal lives of the loud, fast New York City quartet synonymous with the term punk rock.For music fanatics and for Ramones fans, there\\'s a sad story and a peek behind the creative process that made the band\\'s trademark music.Does justice to the humble punk band from Queens that influenced everyone from The Clash and Sex Pistols to U2 and Green Day.Gramaglia and Fields have uncovered plenty of good historical footage, and the interviews with band members, managers, friends and peer fans confirm not only how influential, but how beloved the Ramones were, particularly the ever-visible Joey.It gets on the cinematic record that the Ramones were here, and that they mattered.Chronicles their 30-year history in a style befitting the band: bare-bones, frank, nonsensationalized and adamantly unsentimental.What audiences will want to talk about is the way the film reveals the quixotic human dynamic between the band members, the personal neuroses that simultaneously kept the group together and pulled it apart.An essential addition to the growing (and inherently ironic) field of Punkology. Shot on video, and with the look of a PBS entry, it nevertheless manages to function on several levels -- all of them complex and sophisticated.Culture shock is hopelessly inadequate to describe the experience of the young subjects of the riveting documentary Lost Boys of Sudan.Offers an opportunity to see a good movie and learn something about an issue that has received far too little attention in the U.S. press.It might help you understand an unfamiliar face walking toward you on the street, and that\\'s a great accomplishment for any film.A documentary about two refugees who come to the United States, it offers a detailed look at the hurdles they face but makes no attempt to analyze, explain or advocate changes that would help them.Lacking that exotic \\'foreign\\' focus and by failing to address the hardships of their early lives, we\\'re left with a routine film about teenagers making mistakes or growing up too fast.Reveals with remarkable clarity the clash of dreams vs. reality, hope vs. day-to-day despair.It is remarkable how Mylan and Shenk, without voiceovers or other narrative crutches, so flawlessly capture the American experience -- through the eyes of two Sudanese men.It does make you wonder: about good intentions gone awry, about the mythologizing of the American Dream, about cultural chasms and the ways in which people are so similar, and so different.It\\'s not as illuminating as it could be, but it sheds light just the same.In Lost Boys of Sudan, we don\\'t just hear about the steps of assimilation; we see them, and we feel their cumulative effect.A touching documentary on the immigrant experience -- or at least one very tough slice of it.Too short by half, Lost Boys of Sudan affords frustratingly little by way of real analysis and history. But it does introduce us to two extraordinary young men whose faith in this country is almost as unbearably sad as their stories.Yearns to be optimistic (juxtaposed with the disaster of Sudan, it certainly has the right to be), yet that only ends up underscoring its ache of sadness.An Oscar-worthy documentary.A potent, engrossing look at several young refugees from Sudan\\'s disastrous, endless civil war who\\'ve been relocated to the U.S.A pretty good documentary about a great subject.Lost Boys of Sudan provides gripping evidence of just how costly it is to wear the shoes of an imperiled non-American who is rescued by Uncle Sam.Mylan and Shenk provide an engrossing look at these bright, clean-cut young men and the obstacles they faced in \\'the land of plenty.\\'This tidy and fascinating documentary follows the plight of two young African refugees transplanted to the U.S. to make a better life. The hero of free speech, his voice so musical, cuts a memorable figure.Free speech isn\\'t merely a shibboleth in The Agronomist. As embodied by Dominique, it\\'s a fire-breathing force.A lively, illuminating homage to an extraordinary man of courage, whose cry for his beloved country got him killed.Demme\\'s fine, riveting, and finally joyous film is a fitting capstone to the life of a man who made a difference in a time and place where it was (and is) so much easier not to.It tells instead of shows for the most part, and the telling isn\\'t as effective as it should be.A portrait of an optimist in a time of despair.With Haiti again in the news, The Agronomist is an apt history lesson about its political turmoil and a powerful testimonial about patriotism in the face of oppression.A thoroughly fascinating look at a man with a mind that is subtle, sensitive and alert to life\\'s nuances.Not an extraordinary portrait, but it does portray an extraordinary man.Ragged, of course, but powerful, moving stuff.We are left with vivid images of Dominique, whose desire to change his country, despite formidable intimidation, is an inspiration to any supporter of democracy.A thoroughly absorbing and deeply affecting portrait of an extraordinary leader.We watch Dominique use humor and cynicism as well as anger, and we understand he is not a zealot but simply a reasonable man saying reasonable things in an unreasonable country.Teeming with the profound chaos and more profound harmony of modern Haiti.A labor of love in the best sense: both a ferocious indictment of the corrupt dictatorships that have subjugated Haiti for decades (sometimes with American support) and a stirring salute to a fallen comrade, Dominique.What comes through more than anything is Dominique\\'s resolve -- and the ways that Haitian leaders tried to stop him.Reminds us of previous events in the country\\'s history, as told by a Haitian who impresses us as someone honestly looking for nothing more than peace.The film crackles with Dominique\\'s voice and personality -- but not, unfortunately, his ideas.A film guaranteed to promote righteous indignation, sadness and guilt -- as it makes the case that the intertwined history of the United States and Haiti is one of almost unutterable shame.A sad, and sadly necessary primer on [Haiti\\'s] troubles. This is vicarious cinema at its best.Easily bearing comparison with Bruce Brown\\'s seminal The Endless Summer, this stands as the second-best surf documentary ever made.It\\'s all pretty swanky.Like an adrenaline rush, Riding Giants is fun for a while but it ends on a comedown.Instead of weighing the film down with spaced-out surfer-dude quotes, director Stacy Peralta traces the sport\\'s origins back to the ancient Hawaiians.Before seeing Riding Giants, my ideas about surfing were formed by the Gidget movies, Endless Summer, the Beach Boys, Elvis and lots of TV commercials. ... Riding Giants is about altogether another reality.Peralta has a knack for taking a niche sport and drawing out its universal appeal.From the film\\'s opening seconds, in which a lone surfer emerges from a wave\\'s whitewater to the strains of first organ, then choir music, we can see that the filmmaker has come to sanctify his subject rather than explore it.There\\'s no denying that much of this is spectacular.[]The film\\'s utterly deadpan approach sets it apart from such previous surf movies as The Endless Summer and Step Into Liquid, which were as much adventure travelogues as anything else.Peralta has done a marvelous job at showing the intimidating waves and the guts it must take men (and occasionally women) to ride them.A loving, entertaining tutorial.By the end, you\\'re numb from the waves of information crashing down on your head but you\\'re also worn out and happy, unexpectedly touched by the story of men who climbed the highest mountain around.It\\'s difficult to imagine a movie that deals more thoroughly with big-wave surfing, but Riding Giants can\\'t match the novelty and interest of Peralta\\'s 2001 hit, Dogtown and Z-Boys.Compelling watching.It\\'s a big wet kiss to the heroes and history of an ancient water sport.As he did with skateboarding in Dogtown and Z-Boys, documentarian Stacy Peralta explores the culture, not just the activity, arguing that surfing is as much a lifestyle as it a sport.An aficionada of the saltwater documentary, I am thrilled to report that Riding Giants, Stacy Peralta\\'s exhilarating account of the revolution and evolution in big-wave surfing, is among the best of this breathtaking genre.Awe-inspiring documentary about the history of big-wave surfing. [][]The young Kahn is not a graceful filmmaker. Yet the subject matter is engrossing for anyone interested in architecture and also one of its greatest practitioners.Isn\\'t a bad place to begin if you\\'re curious about architecture and don\\'t know much about Louis Kahn.By the end of My Architect, Kahn has learned that the central contradiction of his father\\'s life can\\'t be resolved -- and that realization becomes the filmmaker\\'s solace and the film\\'s triumph.The finest achievement of My Architect is the way the son locates the light of his father\\'s personality.Does Nathaniel finally find his father? If so, it\\'s neither to excuse nor to condemn him?√† but to do what he was unable properly to do at his father\\'s wake: say goodbye.It is a stunning work that captures with elegance -- and touches of lyricism -- the challenge of finding the man through the artist.My Architect contrasts personal history and public legacy to captivating effect.Meeting this engaging, emotional, articulate cast of characters who surrounded Louis Kahn, the viewer can\\'t help but enjoy his passion and folly.What a sad film this, and how filled with the mystery of human life.A quiet, inspiring study of the vagaries of genius, the blindness of commerce, the pain of family conflicts and the almost sublime power of great architecture or great art.Compelling, luminous, and poignant.We\\'re in a moment of boys reconsidering their dads: Both \\'Big Fish\\' and \\'The Barbarian Invasions\\' invoke similar relationships. But \\'My Architect,\\' unlike those two movies, parries rose-tinted pretensions with stronger senses of history and truth.Irresistible and haunting.Those buildings are remarkably photogenic, particularly the government building in Bangladesh, which is a masterpiece, an ideal mix of modernity and ancient splendor.My Architect assesses the geometric precision of the structures Kahn built and the moral ambiguities of the ones he tore down. Then it sets us free to decide who he really was.One of the most moving nonfiction films in recent memory.Almost against reason, Nathaniel Kahn makes his compulsions work for him. His irritating ways lead to insight; his insistent need for attention ends up making the film more than it unmakes it.What makes it enthralling is the younger Kahn\\'s openness to a range of emotional responses (his own and others\\') to his father\\'s life above and below board. []A twisted pastiche of pain, suffering, and narcissistic indulgence.[]There\\'s no doubting the deep love Caouette feels for his troubled mother, nor his achievement in forging such a rawly emotional film from his own traumatic experiences.Nearly impossible to watch, thoroughly unpleasant yet strangely arresting.A soul-baring scrapbook of a film, its audacity surpassed only by its tragedy.Although aggressively unconventional, it\\'s never pretentious.An astonishing multimedia diary ... all accompanied by a scrolled family history that is as harrowing to read as a ransom note.The movie climbs inside your head and rattles your consciousness.In making beautiful peace with a difficult past, Caouette has delivered a promising vision of a future.Tarnation may not always be pretty, but it\\'s pure, powerful stuff.Background is provided by affectless, unemotional words that seem to float on-screen, adding to the sense of dislocation, of fractured fairy tale.Mesmerizing.Utterly absorbing and accessible.Heartbreaking film.Tinged with nostalgia and flooded with narcissism, this isn\\'t easy to watch. But Caouette\\'s fractured history is imbued with heart-crushing sincerity.It\\'s just devastating stuff.Tarnation leaves the viewer in a positive state of mind.The mesmerizing, trippy and thoroughly heartbreaking result of two decades\\' work.A tortured, inspired, convulsively beautiful film memoir. [][][]The real beauty of \"Metallica\" is its understanding of a business, and a fan base, that provide no way to age gracefully while retaining musical credibility.Whether you know everything or nothing about Metallica, it will rock you.Fans of the band will love the revealing footage, especially landmark moments such as bassist auditions (more famous names showed up than the one they picked) and encounters with the ex-Metallica members (Newsted and Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine).If you\\'re a fan, you will almost certainly be touched by this effort to put an entire dysfunctional band on the couch. And if you\\'re not, well, you\\'re going to giggle.An unflinching and often hilarious look at the humanity of these heavy-metal gods.Absorbing, funny, exhilaratingly entertaining.Serious, funny, frustrating and touching.Fans will undoubtedly thrive on every second. For the rest of us, Monster is precisely that: a creature powerful but ungainly.It\\'s great emotional fodder for old-school Metallica fans and smart, tugging drama for people unfamiliar with the band.[An] overlong but startling heavy metal-therapy documentary.By the time this fascinating two-hour- and-20-minute film ends, you\\'ll have seen the group rise from the ashes of its own massive discontent.Overkill to anyone who never flashed the group\\'s devil horns salute.Metallica: Some Kind of Monster doesn\\'t require you to know anything about the band Metallica or heavy metal music, but it supplies a lot of information about various kinds of monsters.No rock doc has burrowed so deeply into the bruised egos, arrested development and internal conflict that make up a superstar band.A counterintuitive, riveting documentary so honest that it will either become a rock movie classic or a severe embarrassment for the heavy metal band.... a brilliant film.Berlinger and Sinofsky manage something remarkable: They connect us to the actual people who comprise Metallica, the former working- and middle-class California kids who have now spent half their lives rich and famous. Butler\\'s stirring film wasn\\'t made to refute its slanders, though it does. It\\'s a richly documented history of Kerry\\'s war- time experience and of the Veterans Against the War movement.[]This should be revelatory to most people -- but most people will probably never see Mr. Butler\\'s film, and certainly none of those who consider George W. Bush as next to God.One of the most moving things for me was seeing that some of the high-ranking politicians really did recognize that, hey, we need to meet with these young men and hear what they have to say and that footage is amazing stuff.Brinkley has done his homework, and the evidence is on the screen.Butler is on record as a close friend of Kerry\\'s, but he\\'s also a well-respected documentarian, who introduced Arnold Schwarzenegger to America in Pumping Iron and chronicled the heroism of Ernest Shackleton in The Endurance.Filmgoers in the mood for one more go-round will be fascinated by this documentary by George Butler.A partisan film but ultimately a powerful one.A highly effective campaign biography.It underscores, with ample footage from his rallying speeches and his 1971 testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, just how important it was for the antiwar movement to be represented by someone like Kerry.A lucid, emotionally affecting portrait not just of one man but of his times.What happened to the confident 27-year-old we see in the movie, who stares down the police, a hostile Nixon Administration and unfriendly journalists to deliver impassioned first-hand arguments against continuing the Vietnam conflict?His deep knowledge of the now-presidential candidate provides a portrait of a young man consumed by his mission, as he saw it, to save his country from itself.Knowing this much about the frankly impressive early years of one candidate certainly casts him in a new light, one beyond the sound bites and attack ads.Butler does an adroit job of indicating that John O\\'Neill - the architect of the present smear attacks on Kerry\\'s war record - has his own inglorious history.It is difficult to leave this movie without the conviction that Kerry\\'s wartime experience was anything but honorable, regardless of how you feel about his leadership role in Vietnam Veterans Against the War.To be sure it\\'s blatantly partisan, but this documentary about the current presidential candidate\\'s youth is also a moving exploration of Vietnam veterans who ended up protesting the very war they had fought in.An unabashed paean to Kerry\\'s character at a time in the presidential election when Kerry\\'s character is being questionedThough the film is superbly crafted and occasionally - as with footage of Kerry\\'s testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee - inspiring, it figures to be another sitting duck in the free-fire zone declared by the GOP.Butler\\'s film still manages to accomplish what the candidate\\'s foundering campaign has utterly failed to do. It\\'s like a spectacular roadside accident: you can\\'t turn away.[An] unflinching look at the rock world.This amped-up rockumentary doubles as an essay on self-destruction.Erratic, tragic, and absolutely hilarious: Dig! is fantastic filmmaking.A vibrant and vivid documentary masterwork.Linked together by the deadpan, melancholy drawl of Taylor\\'s narration, it\\'s filled with parasites, charlatans and oddballs. Not to mention a succession of wonderful songs.It\\'s a classic music soap opera, but never told with a more raw scream for help at its center.I must admit that I came out of DiG! with a certain degree of admiration for Newcombe -- and for this documentary.The film is so candid and real that it\\'s like watching a friend slip into the morass of addiction, obsession, and pig-headed self-absorption.In a year that has seen several fascinating documentaries on famous rock stars and their problems, Dig! stands out for being about musicians who only think they should be famous. And, man, do they have problems.Its power comes from Timoner sticking with the story over the long haul -- on the road, in hotel rooms, backstage -- getting in-your-face footage and telling a good tale with it.There\\'s nothing cautionary in DiG! that you couldn\\'t learn by renting the 1986 Sex Pistols-related biopic Sid and Nancy -- or exploring the commercially still-born yet revered career of the Velvet Underground.Dig! strikes it rich by contrasting the stories of two bands going in different directions and the animosity that builds between them.Ultimately undermined by the fact that the two rock bands Timoner chose to focus on -- the Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols -- simply don\\'t matter as much as she thinks they do.I don\\'t know that I\\'ve seen a film that better captures the tension between authenticity and ambition that bedevils modern rock music -- the sense that a mass audience is something to be desired and detested at one and the same time.After watching your [Anton\\'s] tantrums, abuse and addiction in DIG! I went straight to the record store to buy your music. And that\\'s something.A genuine rock mockumentary. Cautionary? Naw, but sometimes scary, often hilarious and always engrossing.Through that mixture of luck and diligence that makes the best documentaries, Timoner offers a resonant, often painfully funny, drama about two good friends who become enemies against the backdrop of the pop-music business.DIG! is part post-grunge version of A Star is Born, part Cain and Abel fable of split fraternal affinities, and part reiteration of the oldest story in rock music: the impossibility of reconciling success with integrity.The film ends up producing a sensation similar to the one that comes with discovering a good new band or album. A gripping documentary that uses voluminous period evidence ... to brilliantly reconstruct the entire freak event.[][]A mostly compelling and exceedingly fair-minded look back at the case.Fine as far as it goes -- a worthy lesson in counter-culture history and the rise of media hysteria.A meticulous and often fascinating reconstruction of a chaotic time.[]As an indicting work of journalism, it\\'s very entertaining.An engaging film, but it\\'s a documentary and nothing more.A case study in cultural analysis that aims at too much and achieves too little.A compelling piece of press criticism as it probes the media as terror\\'s conduit of choice, spreading message and validating violence in the 1970s and today.In retrospect the group\\'s story is a painful example of the warped idealism of the radical left and its fateful romance with violence.Uses rare news footage and exclusive interviews to illuminate one of the biggest stories of the 1970s.Gives a fascinating and alarming taste of how a 1974 kidnapping that now seems quaint has morphed into the monstrous terrorist tactic it is today.An in-depth look at the SLA, full of an impressive amount of historical footage and interviews with former members, journalists and other observers.One of the things the film captures most astutely is the beginnings of the American media frenzy that has become a staple of the news cycle.The great achievement of Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst, besides its unearthing of gripping archival material and its groundbreaking new interviews, is its insistence on context rather than sensationalism.Guerilla is a fascinating and cleanly delineated compendium of outrageous footage. The good stuff -- and there\\'s some extremely good stuff -- keeps getting tainted by Mr. Moore\\'s poison-camera penchant for drawing dark inferences from dubious evidence.In all, Fahrenheit 9/11 is a great counterpoint to the Fox News brand of propaganda. It\\'s also a crusade in its own way.Much more than a scathing indictment of Dubya-era complicity, Michael Moore\\'s expos?? lays bare the devastating heartbreak now central to America\\'s wartime reality.Controversial documentary best for older teens.Fair and balanced, as Fox News might say, this is not.[]Ranks, as a work of cinema, with the best of Santiago Alvarez and Esfir Shub.This is the most comprehensive diatribe ever filmed against Bush and his cronies (even though, by necessity, it is focused primarily on Iraq).This is Moore\\'s most powerful movie -- the largest in scope, the most resourceful and skillful in means -- and the best things in it have little to do with his usual ideological take on American power and George Bush.Sometimes slipshod in its making and juvenile in its travesty, and of course it has no interest in overall fairness to Bush. But it vents an anger about this presidency that, as the film\\'s ardent reception shows, seethes in very many of us.It\\'s sprawling at times, but still uncomfortable, angry viewing in a time when apathy and resignation rule.Little of this information is new, but Moore packages what\\'s already known about George W. Bush and his presidency into a piece of rhetoric so persuasive that the Bush reelection campaign could spend the next five months trying to refute it.An enormous film, an angry film, a flawed film and often a very, very funny film.What is new, and why viewing Moore\\'s film will be such a powerful, wrenching experience for so many people, is the situation of sitting in a darkened theatre and watching as a steady tapestry of craven presidentiality unfurls for two hours.Potent and infuriating.Undeniably galvanizing, immensely watchable and damned good filmmaking.I urge all my readers to see the film and judge it for yourselves. It is, at the very least, one of the most thought-provoking releases of the year.An unabashedly partisan challenge both to the administration and to all who accept what they are told without questioning...If this be treason, make the most of it!The best thing about Fahrenheit 9/11 is that viewers can disagree with the filmmaker\\'s own assessment that the war was fought for money and power but still emerge with some healthy questions of their own.Unlike Bowling For Columbine, which editorially often seemed something less than the sum of its sketch-comedy parts, Fahrenheit 9/11 makes its case carefully and clearly. [A] fascinating portrait.A coy yet worthy profile of celebrated Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie.Touch the Sound is remarkable not only because of Glennie\\'s story -- a clinically deaf Grammy-winning musician who has played with the world\\'s great orchestras -- but for the way Riedelsheimer uses sound.The movie makes an interesting addition to what could become Riedelsheimer\\'s evolving and extraordinary gallery of movies that bring the creative process to life.It will be frustrating if you expect narrative and linear development. But if you take it on as a new point of view, valuable even if you don\\'t completely comprehend it yet, Touch the Sound is worth the trip.Riedelsheimer gives the viewer not only Glennie\\'s music, but her own experience of it.[T]his is a film that leaves strong reverberations and a pleasant, sense-scrambled high.Unfortunately, a good deal of Touch the Music is devoted to vacuous interviews with Glennie, who seems positively incapable of saying anything substantial.Bold and often thrilling film.Beautifully shot and filled with gorgeous music, but one of the most inspiring things about it is the way it erases the idea of Glennie\\'s deafness as a handicap.We listen to this film more intensely than is usually the case.Like superior tracks on an exhausting double album, the individual moments of wonder in Touch The Sound are too powerful to dismiss.There is a maddening sense of dislocation through much of the movie -- a feeling that genuinely fascinating questions have been squeezed out by woo-woo philosophizing and material (like Glennie\\'s brief return to the family farm) of only minor import.A feast for the senses.A potent and imaginative creative biography of virtuoso percussionist Glennie.This impressionistic documentary is a mystical exploration of the sensory world as experienced by a musician who lost most of her hearing as a teenager.Call this a profile in courage.Educates in exhilarating ways, ways that are immediately applicable to how one lives one\\'s life.It\\'s rare that a documentary conveys an artist\\'s worldview so compellingly, but then Glennie is no ordinary musician.Fans of the Grammy-winning musician will revel in the proximity to their idol, though second pic from talented helmer Thomas Riedelsheimer plays a tad long to those unfamiliar with his, or her, work. This engrossing work, at once compassionate and rigorous, comprehensive and succinct, would be the centerpiece of any festival for the way it illuminates the life and times of the enigmatic, diminutive Bingenheimer...Has a commercial reach that goes beyond local hero worship thanks in part to an all-star lineup of interviewees, including Cher, David Bowie, Mick Jagger, Gwen Stefani and Courtney Love, to name just a few confirmed Rod-heads.Captures Bingenheimer in all his celeb-fondling glory. But it\\'s a forlorn sight, one the film doesn\\'t turn away from as it arcs from giddy inclusion to lonely pathos.Creepily entertaining.Immensely engrossing.Feels like an elegy for an aging rock pixie.At first a wryly comic study of a real-life, shag-topped Zelig ... Hickenlooper\\'s nuanced documentary shifts into far deeper and darker emotional territory once it starts revealing Bingenheimer\\'s heart-wrenching backstory.Occasionally laughable, often sad, and profoundly evocative of the way we live now, adrift in a culture saturated with celebrity and obsessed by fame.Excellent (if sad) documentary profile.Energetic, nostalgic, occasionally troubling.What gives this its weight and substance is that Mr. Hickenlooper came to see himself in the man whom Nancy Sinatra calls \\'Peter Pan in the school of hard knocks.\\'Evokes what the Japanese call mono no aware, which refers to the impermanence of life and the bittersweet transience of things.Power, control and fame are not the driving forces in [Bingenheimer\\'s] life. He only wants to share the music he loves with as many people as possible.Hickenlooper sees the movie as a character study, and it\\'s an amusing one. But music buffs, in particular, likely will wish he had spent less time documenting his subject\\'s quirky personality and more exploring his professional acumen.It\\'s a funny-sad portrait of fame and its junkies, and of an era and its music.Entertaining though ultimately sad documentary.A sometimes sad, sometimes heartening look at what happens when the ultra-hip age.A sad little movie about a sad little man whom time has passed by.It\\'s the semi-blank slate of Bingenheimer\\'s life that makes the movie worth seeing.This crazy-quilted exploration of the fog of fame deserves an aesthetic that approximates a night of extreme partying. [][]The event\\'s musical director, Steve Jordan, marvels at one point: \\'Looks like y\\'all hired the phone book . . . just looked up \"Blues\" in the Yellow Pages.\\'Features a who\\'s who of world-wise bluesmen (and women) and newbie practitioners.If you know the blues, you\\'ve heard it all before. And if you don\\'t, the film, after a promising step-by-step primer opening, won\\'t help you.Some of the blues performances here are rousingly hot and could make believers out of the staunchest classical music snob.Gets its great groove from the humor and dignity of the true blues musicians it documents.If the movie seems at times a little thin in its chronology and scholarship, it more than makes up for that in the quality of performances that ranges from the cool fire of Angelique Kidjo to the hot smoke of B.B. King.Any movie with Ruth Brown, Bonnie Raitt, Mavis Staples and Aaron Neville (with his brothers) for openers can\\'t be all bad.Comes alive with the more relaxed performances from its senior set -- men and women in their late sixties through to their late eighties -- performing the music they\\'ve lived and breathed their whole lives.The massive stage at Radio City Music Hall doesn\\'t lend itself easily to the intimate particulars of the blues.This is the sort of concert film made for high-end home theatre experiences.It\\'s hugely entertaining.If you ever loved this kind of music, Lightning will bring the reasons back. If you haven\\'t, you\\'ll likely wonder where this has been all your life.An aptly named blast from the past that manages to sizzle in the present.Entertaining, exalting educational, uplifting -- and a total blast.The best thing about this film of an all-star 2003 Radio City Music Hall concert is, perhaps predictably, the still-sizzling power of elder statesmen and stateswomen of the blues.Lightning is often great fun, and remains an important record.Fuqua\\'s film captures a night when lightning struck more than twice in the same place.Lightning is a joyous, toe-tapping celebration of a musical style born of sorrow. []The film stands quite chillingly as a final statement from a woman trying to fight her own commodification.A haunting exploration of a ruined and wasted life.[T]his movie literally gave me the chills.Engrossing, educational, amusing and disturbing.Provides an opportunity to study one of history\\'s supposed anomalies: a female serial killer.Does afford a real-life view of Wuornos during the days of her final appeal and her ultimate date with death.Broomfield is too fond of himself by half, and tilts the movie too much toward his personal objections to the death penalty.A valuable and insightful contribution to the mountain of Aileen Wuornos speculation and documentation.It does ... make a powerful argument against capital punishment, no matter which side of the debate you happen to take.Her intense denial is fascinating, and extremely sad, to watch.No one should have to endure the life that Aileen Wuornos led, and we leave the movie believing that if someone, somehow, had been able to help that little girl, her seven victims would never have died.Digs into the soul of this abused child, who never got the treatment she needed. Her eyes, radiating madness, will haunt your dreams.Though one can question the movie\\'s quality as a documentary ... Aileen raises such troubling issues that it stays, hellishly, in your mind.It\\'s a far more gripping documentary than Broomfield\\'s 1992 Wuornos film.Even if she skirts the big questions, Wuornos is a riveting presence -- affable and articulate one minute, twitchy and petulant the next.The filmmaker\\'s ego and ethics aside, there\\'s no denying the power of Wuornos\\' behavior here.The director ... makes a compelling argument that Wuornos never got a fair deal from the legal system and that she should have been spared death because of insanity.Nick Broomfield\\'s documentary, which chronicles the events that led up to the execution of Aileen Wuornos, is an absorbing film, partly because its subject exudes a scary charisma.She was guilty, no doubt, but as this immensely moving film makes clear, Aileen Wuornos was also heartbreakingly human. Bright Leaves is not the kind of film that thetruth.com would use in its anti-smoking campaign.A gently provocative film diary about tobacco and its mixed legacy.Bright Leaves is a beguiling film. Watching it is like spending time with an old, somewhat chatty but endearing friend.McElwee\\'s best film since Sherman\\'s March.It\\'s a meandering visit by a curious man with a quiet sense of humor.The mysteries McElwee sets out to solve aren\\'t very involving, and his meandering style, while charming first and literate, becomes repetitive and yes, even a little dull.It\\'s a movie of odd juxtapositions and droll observations.Inevitably poignant but also often amusing and always deeply touching, this film is likely to stick in one\\'s memory for all its concerns, not just cigarettes.McElwee, he of the wonderful Sherman\\'s March, noodles delightfully around the South again, only this time in his native North Carolina.A multilayered film that gradually finds its focus.A weightless film. Worse still, McElwee\\'s languid tone makes his journey lack conviction.A witty and sometimes touching tale of film, family and lung cancer.Like Moore\\'s Fahrenheit 9/11 and Spurlock\\'s Super Size Me, McElwee\\'s Bright Leaves takes on a sizable foe -- in this case, big tobacco -- but with such grace and wit that his message never seems medicinal.We are hooked into a low-tech but compelling dynamic -- between relatively static images and McElwee\\'s sensitive, connective narrative.The results are brilliantly amusing; this is a movie that doesn\\'t make you feel stupid on the way out or like someone has been spraying you in the face while making his talking points.The filmmaker\\'s rich, husky-voiced narration manages to shape this collection of half-formed ideas and observations into a tightly packed little roll-up that\\'s worth taking a puff on.Where most documentaries offer us facts to hold on to, [McElwee\\'s] are obsessed with the mystery of things we don\\'t know and never will.Personal yet the opposite of egotistical, truthful yet playful, happily distractible yet patient, and above all grateful for those in the world he loves around him, McElwee makes movies the way life might, ideally, be lived.McElwee is digressive in the best sense. He takes the time to discover what people are like when they\\'re being themselves; he wants to know where their lives are taking them, what byways they are going down.Becomes both a mystery and memoir in progress and though the filmmaker does not find the truth he is looking for, it was clearly a quest worth undertaking. Hilariously, The Yes Men follows a subversive group of well-organized activists posing as guest speakers...Its willingness to mock not just the men in power suits but the journos and news organisations who swallow their FTSE gibberish is salutary indeed.[]A clumsy movie.Inspiring and shows just how far a couple of guys, a few computers, and a good sense of humor can go.The Yes Men\\'s political performance art is very funny and much care obviously goes into it.The Yes Men has its moments, but they\\'re too few and far between to make us drop our Palm Pilots and dissolve into continuous laughter.There are few things as satisfying as watching the wealthy, righteous, powerful or pompous get fully duped. As a result, there is a great deal of satisfaction in The Yes Men.The filmmakers include some good behind-the-scenes footage ... and have unfettered access, but the movie sometimes feels like one long college fraternity stunt.The Yes Men feels padded at only 83 minutes, as if the footage had been stretched to fill the running time, but it gets the point across that humanity is sorely missing from the corporate world.[They\\'re] playing these jokes on these obscure audiences.Yes, The Yes Men is funny, but it\\'s humor that hurts.It\\'s so smirkily inside-baseball it never bothers to make its argument; the film simply proceeds from the assumption that all of us in the audience are in agreement with its point.Equally funny and sketchy -- like a leftist reality TV show that somehow took on an extra hour and pulled a guerrilla infiltration of movie theatres.It is hard not to be sporadically impressed by the audacity with which they stir people, some influential, out of complacency about the plight of the world\\'s poor.Achieves what any good documentary tries to: It\\'s thought-provoking, insightful and entertaining at the same time.An issues-based doc with a sense of humor. It\\'s a bit flimsy, but you have to hand it to these guys: They\\'re con artists with convictions.This sly little documentary packs a wickedly satiric punch.They have such colorful characters and such an alarming story to tell that the film works in spite of its imperfections.A likable documentary profile. []Greenwald has fashioned a fine attack dog, and he\\'s sicced it on a deserving subject.Taken for what it is, Outfoxed is still worth watching, especially for the politically active.Pure partisan warfare of the liberal stripe, to be sure, but that doesn\\'t make it any less disturbing when discussing such a major shaper of public opinion as Fox, whose motto, judging from this film, more accurately should be \\'You retort, we deride.\\'Makes a crucial argument that has less to do with conservatives and liberals than with the coarsening of political discourse and the sinking standards of journalism and news -- subjects that go far beyond any particular news operation.While Outfoxed surely will appeal more to liberals than to conservatives, its value to its self-selected audience lies not in upending anyone\\'s expectations, but in taking the uninitiated down the Fox News rabbit hole.Those with negative opinions of Fox News probably never watch it and may find the ample clips on display here eye-opening.For independent thinkers and those who think of journalism as a profession of accuracy, fairness and ethics, there\\'s more than enough to chew on.An often grave but sometimes hilarious picture of a hugely powerful network.Seems as if it were recorded on a camcorder and narrated by a guy sitting in his kitchen with a microphone. That doesn\\'t negate its effectiveness, however.A rush job, and it shows.A frontal assault on Murdoch and Fox.Outfoxed is effective at undermining the no-news-all-screaming FOX News Channel and giving it a taste of its own medicine.The most damning evidence of this exceptionally damning film comes not from its covey of liberal commentators but from the mouth of Fox News itself.Undeniably entertaining and eye-opening, Outfoxed shows how Fox works, but not why.When those talking heads metamorphose into familiar ranting heads, it becomes another mesmerizing right-wing horror show.With cheesy graphics, an overwrought announcer and far too many talking-head interviews, Outfoxed has an amateurish look and feel.Greenwald\\'s central thesis rings true.Methodically works to disarm the ready-made accusation that it is outfoxing Fox by stooping to its methods.Provides stimulating evidence of how thoroughly news can be skewed, political agendas served and a climate of fear created. []For theater lovers -- on both sides of the footlights.Old-timers, showbiz buffs and big-stage wanna-bes will not be disappointed.Rather than listen to these old-timers reminisce about the good old days ... my advice is to get out and support your local thespians instead.McKay\\'s straightforward cinematic valentine, which also includes rare archival stage footage, is a treat for those bedazzled by the idea of Broadway in its prime.[The subjects] eagerly unwind before McKay\\'s one-man camera, reminiscing about everything from their finest hours to the days when ticket prices still ran in single digits.It takes more than a fan to analyze the legacy of a period. But a fan is just what it takes to indulge in that legacy, which is exactly what Broadway: The Golden Age is all about.The stories they tell in this warm, evocative documentary crackle with humor and glow with reverence. By listening to those stories, you\\'ll glow too.If you love the theater, you\\'ve got to see the film and simply enjoy as everyone from A (Edie Adams) to Z (Karen Ziemba) holds forth.While less than artfully composed, Rick McKay\\'s homegrown documentary about the glory days of the American theater represents an invaluable oral history.It\\'s the videotaped equivalent of a primary research data dump. But to quote Bette Davis by way of Edward Albee: What a dump.Theater fans, whose numbers continue to dwindle, will cherish the rest of Broadway as a remembrance of a great time long gone.In what must have been a daunting challenge, given the richness of the material, McKay managed to cull from more than 250 hours of footage an admirably comprehensive and revealing documentary running a taut 110 minutes.These anecdotes come across with powerful emotion, although many of them relay oft-documented events.Perhaps the screen\\'s most authoritative encapsulation of Broadway history and an intimately resonant one.Manages to immerse us in the moment, Broadway from the late \\'40s to the mid-\\'60s, even if we weren\\'t there.Riveting, historically valuable and heart-skippingly exhilarating.If you\\'ve ever fantasized about sitting in an all-night deli listening to veteran theater people dish and reminiscence about the Great White Way in mid-20th century bloom, filmmaker Rick McKay\\'s cascading cavalcade of talking heads is the next best thing.A delightful \\'That\\'s Entertainment\\' for the theater, offering priceless interviews with a who\\'s who of entertainers and behind-the-scenes talent, as well as tantalizing snippets of long-ago performances.The strength of McKay\\'s film is not in identifying a cultural period, but in giving voice to so many great theater people. []Tony Montana and Mark Brian Smith\\'s acidic, vitriolic takedown of Duffy boasts the abrasive intensity of a migraine headache and the depth and scope of a bona fide American tragedy.A portrait of Hollywood hubris extraordinaire.[An] unflinching depiction of a would-be Tarantino turning himself into chopped liver.A compulsive, cautionary tale about a man whose self-trumpeted \\'deep cesspool of creativity\\' seems destined to remain undredged.Enjoyable because you get to see a huge ego and shameless publicist get his comeuppence.The story of the neither late nor great Troy Duffy would make the perfect film-school graduation gift.In their rush to give Duffy his comeuppance, the filmmakers barrel past their movie\\'s real potential, which could have been a blistering expos of Hollywood\\'s bandwagon mentality.While the film follows Duffy\\'s business disasters and blusterings, it never really offers much depth on either its central subject or his posse.It\\'s a tale of ambition run amok and blown opportunity that is not only fascinating but cautionary.Cautionary tales about the pitfalls of indie filmmaking don\\'t come more searingly truthful or sober-minded than Overnight.Audiences may reasonably wonder why they\\'re being asked to spend time with Duffy. It\\'s not an easy question to answer.Highly entertaining, in a schadenfreude sense, but incomplete.Overnight is a pungent documentary that details the awful, groping evanescence of Hollywood buzz.It\\'s like watching a runaway train race down a mountain: We know that a crash is coming; we just don\\'t know how many casualties there will be.It\\'s a fascinating cautionary tale.A quintessential Hollywood story that might have just as easily been called Karma.Duffy is made into such a consistently awful person that you\\'re seduced into loathing him, even though it\\'s hard to believe he\\'s not putting us on.The latest entry in the ever-expanding Harvey Weinstein demonology, this jittery documentary is as raw as the filmmakers\\' rattled nerves.If this documentary finds an audience I wouldn\\'t be surprised to see Duffy make a comeback as an actor, playing the heavy in low-budget action movies. He certainly gives a jaw-dropping performance here. []Packs a powerful punch if you\\'re ready for a lesson in foreign policy.Made up of almost nothing but talking heads, and no matter how cogent their statements, it makes for a pretty static movie that\\'s unlikely to engage anyone opposed to its point of view.Despite its slant, the movie offers some illuminating details, and director Robert Greenwald constructs a solid argument that the Iraq war was driven more by expedient politics than facts.Uncovered: The War on Iraq is like a trial lawyer\\'s summation during a lengthy case in which allegations are familiar but their full context is not.Any person voting in this year\\'s presidential election owes it to America\\'s future to see this film.Uncovered has no interest in explaining the Bush administration\\'s case for war for them: This is the prosecution\\'s argument, and it is extremely well-made.This documentary makes an effective argument that isn\\'t likely to spur much debate, despite the efforts of the filmmakers to do just that.If you\\'ve ever wondered why we got into the Iraq war and what still faces us there, this is the film that can explain it to you (even if you agree with Bush\\'s policies).There is nothing new in Robert Greenwald\\'s sobering doc.A thorough indictment of the Bush administration\\'s focus on Iraq.Starts in an unusually calm and measured way for a documentary critical of that particular military adventure. All antiwar docs, it turns out, are not cut from the same cloth.This hastily slapped-together festival of talking heads is so staid, one longs for some of Moore\\'s look-at-me theatrics, and despite the movie\\'s sober-citizen approach, it\\'s no less one-sided than Fahrenheit 9/11.Provides compelling arguments that even those on the right wing of the political spectrum will be hard pressed to entirely refute.Greenwald does nothing with the interviews, basically just posting them, one after the other, with the hope that viewers will do his job for him. The result is one-sided and bone-dry.Smart, engaging discourse.A film that\\'s a model of a concise, cogent case for the prosecution.A crisp historical document that is worth your time.The movie manages to slap some of the cynicism out of you, even if it feels more like a box of dossiers than a documentary.After listening to this steady anti-Bush drumbeat for the past several months, even the most devout progressives may start to feel as if they\\'ve heard much of this sermon a hundred times before. Murderball is no Rocky-esque hymn to the human spirit. It\\'s more like a prison movie...An honest, down-to-earth account of how life goes on for people with disabilities.What emerges is more interesting, thankfully, than a linear offering of sporting triumph in the face of adversity.A leftfield sports documentary that\\'s as insightful and thought-provoking as it is fast and furious.One of 2005\\'s very best documentaries.Few sports movies with a premise this powerful ever bother to dig this deep.Inspiring.This offbeat documentary is inspiring and jaw-droppingly original.Henry Alex Rubin and Dana Adam Shapiro ... pack an amazing amount of storytelling into these 86 minutes, alternating between several distinct narrative threads to create a documentary as engrossing as any fictional movie.The frank lack of condescension and mean moments of Murderball make it more than a film about sports or quadriplegics: It becomes a movie about life, about struggle, about pain, bitterness and pushing forward.Wheels us through an emotional obstacle course so rigorous and satisfying you\\'ll be gulping for air by the end.I don\\'t know whether directors Henry Alex Rubin and Dan Adam Shapiro set out to show the jock mentality with such clarity, but that\\'s precisely what their gripping movie does.None of this is treated as anything but what it is: trying to get the most out of life by --- to paraphrase the famous Warren Zevon hockey tribute -- getting the ball, keeping it and trying to hurt somebody.This is not heartwarming, cuddly, or safe. it is bracing, brash, harsh, and angry. And it is thrilling.While the game itself is enough to hold viewers\\' interest, the filmmakers go much further. They delve into the psyche of the players.Their game is ugly, raucously verbal, overtly physical and, as displayed in Murderball\\'s rapid-pace editing, a heck of a lot of fun to watch.Co-directors Rubin and Shapiro deliver the rare documentary that totally entertains, informs, and inspires.The emotional resonance that results from the focus on several unique individuals is what makes this a worthwhile viewing experience.It\\'s the best sports documentary since Hoop Dreams, a great piece of work.Ultimately, the film is an affectionately manly tribute to these athletes, for whom every game -- and every day -- is a triumph. Gibney\\'s film never forgets the human side: the macho execs nearly killing themselves on boys\\' vacations with motorbikes, sky-diving and general risk-enhanced bonding; the suicide of one, the scapegoat imprisonment of another.... Enron: the smartest guys in the room pinpoints a moment when corporate morality was shredded like so many tonnes of incriminating documents in a big business run by small, small men.Audiences jeered and shouted at the screen in outrage. It has that kind of impact, without resorting to any of Michael Moore\\'s below-the-belt tactics.[]Alex Gibney takes a notorious tale of corporate greed and plays it as Greek tragedy, Texas-style.Deft, entertaining and infuriating documentary about one of the most egregious cases of corporate corruption in American history.A meticulously researched and ably handled chronicle of one of the largest corporate scandals in American history.This thorough and thoroughly depressing account of the biggest corporate bankruptcy in history, and the rip-off that accompanied it, is so infuriating and dispiriting that your blood will boil, if not properly watered down.It\\'s not an indictment, so much. It\\'s more like a mirror.The movie helps the average American understand the nature of the shell games perpetuated by Enron and how \\'synergistic corruptions\\' can corrupt absolutely.The great strength of the film is its conclusion that this is not a story about numbers; it is a story about people.Doesn\\'t require an interest in business affairs to be captivating. It unfolds like a Wall St. disaster movie with two eminently hissable villains presiding over the catastrophe.Gibney\\'s documentary is ultimately not about business and numbers but about morality; how a group of people, blinded by money, lost their souls.Go see it before you buy another stock you don\\'t understand. Go see it before you bank your retirement on the company pension fund. Go see it before you vote in another election.Working in a slick, high-gloss style, director Alex Gibney presents the lurid Enron essentials in a film that will have you shaking your head in disbelief and dismay.There will be lots of seething at the sight of it all, but there are enough good laughs to make the experience more than worthwhile.As compelling a refresher course as one could hope for.Gibney has been able to get his hands on the right materials, and he assembles the right talking heads to string the story together.Allow yourself the pleasure of being thoroughly entertained while being equally outraged by this movie.It\\'s a chilling, completely fascinating documentary that reveals the face of unregulated greed in a way that\\'s every bit as terrifying as Lon Chaney\\'s unmasking in The Phantom of the Opera. Maybe more so, because everything here is true. Watch them march to the very extremes of extremis, though, and it\\'s easy to feel awe. Life must beget life, whatever the cost.Some of the eggs and chicks freeze, and the parents\\' cries are painful to hear (probably more for us than for them).French director Luc Jacquet and a team of incredibly brave (and heavily bundled) documentary filmmakers captured this complicated mating ritual with strikingly crisp photography that\\'s both grand and intimate.The avian protagonists\\' comical ungainliness on land and deadpan manner make for adorable viewing, while the austere, glacial landscape is consistently breathtaking.This astonishing film, shot in the Antarctic, captures sights never seen before.Birth, death, romance, danger: All play a role in Jacquet\\'s homage to a remarkably endearing creature.Morgan Freeman\\'s slick voice-over compounds a slightly plodding structure, but the dedication of the penguins -- and the cameramen -- assure your wonderment.It\\'s a missed opportunity to make a great documentary, but still decent family entertainment, with awe-inspiring Antarctic scenery and some very cute stars.March of the Penguins is a staggeringly beautiful film about the breeding cycle of the toughest birds on Earth, the emperor penguins of Antarctica.To human observers, the ways in which animal behavior variously resembles or contrasts with human behavior is an inexhaustible source of fascination.Beautiful, stimulating and painstaking.Luc Jacquet\\'s March Of The Penguins is, astoundingly, the second most successful documentary ever made.The glacially beautiful new documentary March Of The Penguins confirms that no computer-animated or hand-drawn penguin could ever match the curious majesty of the genuine article.A perfect family movie, a perfect date movie, and one of the most eye-ravishing documentaries ever made.Documentaries are the surprise hits of the summer, and none is scoring bigger than Luc Jacquet\\'s wondrous look at the emperor penguins of Antarctica.The movie easily transcends the \\'Isn\\'t-that-amazing?\\' animal genre.It\\'s an incredible tale of ritual and perseverance, both for the emperor penguin and the untouched land, sparkling white and aqua, pristine and brutal.Yes, this is nature anthropomorphized. But after seeing this touching and beautiful film, you might not be so quick to dismiss that \\'They\\'re a lot like us\\' point of view.Mr. Jacquet\\'s magnificent exploration of the tortured life-and-love cycle of the noble emperor penguin soars as one of the most passionate and perceptive expressions of interspecies empathy in the history of the cinema.Jacquet\\'s penguins are as absorbing and incredible as any man-made phantasmagoria you\\'ll find in the multiplex this summer, and it\\'s all real. Fall in love with these brave and beautiful birds.[][]Irving captures some memorable images?√á¬™ but generally relies on the birds\\' natural photogenic charm as well as the human dimensions of the drama to sustain the 83-minute film.The beautiful shots of San Francisco\\'s lush Telegraph Hill are captivating by themselves, but the film\\'s greatest achievement is its humanity.In the spirit of all good documentaries, Wild Parrots transcends its ostensive subject.A bright window into the wild kingdom just outside our door that most of us barely notice, if at all.A cornball charmer of a film with some beautiful birds and homespun wisdom.Well-considered, beautifully made, and often gripping in its narrative, the film epitomizes the best the documentary format can offer.Charming, intelligent entertainment that should attract the same family audiences that flocked to Winged Migration in 2001.An absolute delight and nothing like the wimpy nature film its title suggests. It\\'s a soaring -- figuratively and literally -- documentary with a surprising emotional power.A loving, dopey documentary about the bird man of a place with a view of Alcatraz.It contains ample joys and sorrows, and it will introduce you to some of the year\\'s most memorable characters.[A] charming, layered documentary.The biggest problem with this documentary is its title, which makes it sound like a bird-watching club filmstrip. While it indeed concerns birds, it\\'s about a lot more.What might have been a static portrait has become a true story, with tragic turns, joyful surprises and provocative glimpses into the meaning of life.Turns out to be that rarity: a movie that makes its audience happier for having seen it.In many ways, this is a movie for outcasts and outcasts at heart -- most of us, I\\'ll wager.Not that San Francisco needs more tourists, but Wild Parrots captures a nice little piece of the city\\'s magic, its landmarks, hills, tree-lined streets and quietly regal neighborhoods.Bittner is calm, intelligent, confiding, wise and well-spoken. Of course, the legendary filmmaker can\\'t resist inserting his own outsize ego into the story, but somehow this documentary has room for two larger-than-life characters.Herzog has his documentary in hand, explaining that what we have here \"iz on astone-ishing story of beauty and depth\". He\\'s not wrong.Like so much of Herzog\\'s work, both narrative and documentary, this is an engrossing look at obsessive behavior gone terribly awry.Treadwell, a failed TV actor, is presented as someone desperate to give and receive love. That he went to such extremes is tragic, but also, in Herzog\\'s sympathetic eyes, deeply human.Part punk wildlife doc, part diary of a twisted soul, part cautionary tale, Grizzly Man is a complex, unique and engrossing journey into the murky recesses of an unhinged mind.At turns fascinating and banal?√á¬™ a film that dances around vital questions about the human condition that it is barely able to articulate, let alone address.Fascinating as both nature documentary and as a portrait of a narcissistic monomaniac, utterly in keeping with Herzogian type.He was enough of an amateur to be relaxed and unselfconscious, yet enough of a professional to generate all this outstanding footage, and quite rightly Herzog declines to patronise or make fun of him.German auteur Werner Herzog pieces together the remarkable footage Treadwell left behind into a superb portrait of a fractured obsessive living literally on the edge.An alternately gripping and funny-charming nature film and psychological study.[Treadwell] left behind 100 hours of some of the most astonishing nature footage ever captured by camera.Compelling, disturbing documentary.Herzog is still the only person who could have made Grizzly Man. His admiration for Treadwell has its limits, but he understands, better than most directors, what it means to follow dreams into the belly of the beast.A rich, well-crafted documentary that offers a rare glimpse at someone who respected Mother Nature but refused to live by her rules.It\\'s an uncompromising character study of a man who found peace, and ultimately death, among some of the most dangerous predators on the planet.Grizzly Man is a truly provocative essay.By fearlessly examining the man warts and all, Herzog has fashioned a nature documentary unlike any I\\'ve I think I have ever seen.What makes Grizzly Man remarkable are the edited tapes that at first seem to show a man at peace among nature, and then later reveal the startlingly fragile state of that man\\'s mind and persona.As unsettling as it is fascinating.As a filmmaker, in Herzog\\'s opinion, Treadwell was without equal. But as a naturalist, well, let\\'s just say that his canteen had sprung a leak. This documentary by first-time director Boynton proves democracy and capitalism are disturbingly intertwined.The movie is both frightening and ironically funny, sometimes both.Subject matter dominates over filmmaking craft in Rachel Boynton\\'s somewhat sloppy but otherwise riveting documentary.Politics and mass communication are the volatile subjects of Rachel Boynton\\'s information-packed documentary.It\\'s a galling and provocative experience to viewers of any political persuasion, and a reminder to the left of how easily idealism can run amok.Insightful if not altogether objective.Unlikely as it sounds, a documentary that details with jaw-dropping candor how contemporary political campaigning works at the highest levels of government is set not in this country but in the far-off reaches of Bolivia.Rachel Boynton\\'s painfully timely film is actually a full-court tragedy -- the sorry tale of a battle won and a war lost.Political junkies will love this movie.Ultimately provides a vivid illustration of the not-so-hopeful future of international politics.Gani is certainly no hero and his American strategists come off as the worst sort of interlopers.What\\'s eye-opening, as well as depressing, is that the film reveals how even the politics of a nation\\'s life and death can now be reduced to a technocratic shell game.Only a naf would be surprised by Our Brand Is Crisis, but only a nihilist would not be alarmed by the endless reverberations of Boynton\\'s case study-and by its suggestion of a systemic separation of modern politics and the national good.Our Brand Is Crisis proves as entertaining as the earlier The War Room, which also featured Carville, but is more somber.Boynton maintains a relatively level tone and clear eye and, thus, allows her audience to ask some hard questions about whether our democratic process translates all that clearly in other countries.Boynton isn\\'t interested in telling a story, only in the atmosphere of political consultancy. But we already knew this kind of thing happens in American politics. Why shouldn\\'t Bolivia be entitled to sophisticated polling advice?Rachel Boynton\\'s momentous documentary chronicles the election-strategizing process in scrupulous detail.Our Brand Is Crisis\\' queasy power comes from its understanding of how elections have tangible real-world consequences that are measured in deaths and riots as wells as polls and ballots.Among other things, Our Brand Is Crisis is about the failure of good intentions -- a potent American theme at the moment.Exotic location notwithstanding, Rachel Boynton\\'s riveting political documentary Our Brand Is Crisis is a sequel to the Clinton-era campaign vrit, The War Room. []A casual interest in dance is all it takes to enjoy Ballets Russes, an enchanting new documentary about the famed French ballet company.... a heartening affirmation of the spirit that helped many dancers to thrive in their heyday more than half a century ago and to survive as teachers, dance devotees and priceless raconteurs.Enchanting, edifying and exhilarating.Deftly mixing talking-head interviews, archival footage, and sly musical cues, Ballets Russes impressively catalogues 30 years of the companies\\' triumphs and failures, and does so in a way that a dance neophyte can easily absorb ...Capturing glimpses of those halcyon days, filmmakers Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine offer the documentary Ballets Russes, riveting in rare footage and poignant interviews with some of the dancers who brought ballet to the hinterlands.Ballets Russes does an amazing job of unearthing footage of the famous ballet troupe from its beginnings in turn-of-the-century Paris through to its demise in the \\'60s.Vintage footage and modern interviews and staged \\'events\\' tell the tale of this important piece of art history.Geller and Goldfine orchestrate a ballet movie that is every bit as entertaining, gossipy and relevant as it is historically accurate.Dance fans will be dazzled by its treasure trove of archival dance footage. But those who know little of ballet will find plenty here to feed the soul, in the film\\'s rich portraits of men and women nearing the end of a life lived in the arts.Ballets Russes may not be the greatest dance documentary ever made, but it could well be the most accessible and touching.An electrifying documentary by Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine that lovingly and authoritatively brings to life an era of unequaled artistic excitement.The stories and people presented here are involving enough to enthrall anyone.Warmly humane, but never sentimental.A daisy chain of touching now-and-then moments.A captivating if somewhat conventional documentary.The archival footage is so breathtaking, the reminiscences so piquant, that even a stranger to dance can\\'t help but be swept up by this peek into such exquisite, now vanished glamour.Geller and Goldfine have assembled a vital historical document, covering a cultural era now mostly lost, corrupted imperceptibly but permanently when fledgling ballerinas started dreaming about Broadway and Hollywood instead of Swan Lake.Blessed with a surfeit of archival footage and dozens of marvelous, first-person stories, filmmakers Dan Geller and Dayna Goldfine have created a rich, complex portrait of the legendary Russian Ballet.Enacts its drama with a light editorial hand and unavoidable sentimentality. Even if you didn\\'t follow the story then, Wranovics tells it so wryly your interest never flags -- and there\\'s more suspense for newcomers, since the mystery and court verdict remain in doubt until the end.Up For Grabs, a buoyant documentary by Michael Wranovics, touches three bases of contemporary life: greed, litigiousness and a fixation with fame, however fleeting, that rises to the level of dementia.It\\'s a terrific story -- part mystery, part farce, part legal nail-biter -- with a last-minute reversal so bitterly ironic it could have been scripted by Billy Wilder.In the annals of baseball history, their battle will remain a curious little footnote, but sometimes footnotes are more compelling than the main text.This smartly assembled comedy articulates irritation with and bewilderment at its subject: the legal battle for possession of a baseball.It would be hard to find a more succinct and entertaining indictment of American popular culture and obsessive sports fans.It definitely has entertainment value, providing of course that you\\'re able to find amusement in greed, duplicity and expensive litigation.Up for Grabs may be the perfect sports doc for this me-first day and age.A twisty little documentary about the aftermath of Bonds\\' fat swing.A winning combination of humor and crafty filmmaking that cleverly masks the social commentary going on beneath.The film spends a little too much time on the fates of previous home run balls in general.Michael Wranovics\\' documentary replays this sorry chapter in all-American greed in glorious detail.Michael Wranovics\\' highly enertaining documentary Up for Grabs is a wry, Rashomon-like tale.The longer the case drags on, the more you may begin to wish that, somehow, both sides lose.Director Michael Wranovics does a deft job of keeping things moving, eccentric and nutty: After all, where else, and under what other circumstances, could someone say \\'he caught it\\' about Popov in a singles bar and have women flock around him?Popov himself emerges as the story\\'s villain, a schmuck with the personality of a TV anchorman and the common sense of Troy Duffy.The tone is best captured by one Bay Area sportswriter\\'s wry comment that catching a valuable home run ball is \\'sort of like winning the lottery except you feel like you earned it.\\'Captures the excitement of the game as well as the intimate drama -- and comedy -- of the human conflict.With complex lead characters, an endless supporting cast and focus on an inanimate object that draws out the weakness in men, the movie has more in common with the Lord of the Rings trilogies than anything from the camera of Ken Burns.A sly curve ball of a documentary best described as a sports-themed Rashomon with an O. Henry twist. After Innocence is a crusading documentary driven by DNA testing that\\'s brought freedom for men who served years in prison for crimes they didn\\'t commit.Eye-opening.Despite its flaws After Innocence raises staggering questions about virtually every aspect of the criminal-justice system.After Innocence is, without making it overly obvious, anti-death penalty on the grounds that a just society cannot afford to make any mistakes that we cannot attempt to rectify.Informative (we learn, for example, that exonerees are generally given no follow-up assistance upon release, as parolees are) and deeply moving.Each lost face in the documentary is a burning reminder of the human toll when our justice system succumbs to its imperfections.Sanders is more interested in specific human struggles than in larger political points, but she knows these men form a mosaic with a message that\\'s unmistakable.Deeply touching and overwhelmingly sad.Even-handed but quietly devastating.[A] rousing, quietly outraged documentary.Sanders\\' report from a new frontier in American jurisprudence is filled with the hopeful, haunted look of men who won\\'t easily be forgotten.In her clear and compelling film, Sanders lets the innocents do the talking.The moral purity of After Innocence is so overwhelming that it simply leaves you with nothing to say or do. It\\'s kind of beyond criticism.Taylor does her cause no real favors by trotting out only the most articulate, most clearly railroaded exonerees.The film cuts away from such personal stories too quickly, eager to sell us on airy, unjustified claims.A powerful indictment of a judicial system too anxious to close cases, and then close ranks when someone tries to reopen them.Calm, deliberate and devastating, Jessica Sanders\\'s documentary confirms many of the worst fears about weaknesses in the American criminal-justice system.Both riveting and disturbing.After Innocence doesn\\'t inspire much confidence in the American legal system.A compelling look at a flawed system. [][]The movie prefers to show snippets of life and let the audience make the connections. Many of these scenes prove memorable.If Sauper is fired up by anti-globalist conviction, his instincts as an artist and as a man rule out any kind of rhetoric or cheapness.The words Being poor is like being old are scrawled on the door of a shack; like this movie, it\\'s a howl waiting to be heard.Darwin\\'s Nightmare is an urgent, horrific, yet at times oddly blinkered vision of the crisis of modern Africa.[]It immerses you in its reality one toe at a time, until suddenly you are in over your head, gasping for air as the horror of the situation reveals itself in all its savage devastation.Sauper\\'s delicately horrific documentary is a short, sharp slap in the face of the developed world, and a long overdue one at that.This, Sauper\\'s film says without words, is what the human race has evolved into -- the developed world preying on the undeveloped to the extent that people suffer and die so that two million fillets a day are available to Euro-diners.[A] despairing, essential documentary.Darwin\\'s Nightmare is many things, including an environmental cautionary tale, a critique of globalization and a portrait of a community, country and continent in deep crisis.Sauper\\'s documentary is meant to reveal first-hand the devastating effects of globalization -- at least, an irresponsible form of it -- on a poor, foreign culture, and for the most part it succeeds.Becomes Errol Morris\\'s bad dream -- a documentary apparently uninterested in any factual basis for its arguments.An uncompromising portrait of how global capitalism can exploit an area\\'s resources to the point of near annihilation.Sauper captures a world in which life and death are treated with equal practicality -- and disregard.With a roving eye and an attentive heart, Sauper\\'s film takes in everyone involved in this miasma.The documentary tries to pin Africa\\'s suffering on capitalism, but dances around the real problem.Hubert Sauper\\'s harrowing, indispensable documentary about Tanzania presents the agonized human face of globalization.It illuminates the sinister logic of a new world order that depends on corrupt globalization to put an acceptable face on age-old colonialism. The Doll in the title of the fine, touching documentary New York Doll is far from a supermodel.[]New York Doll is still a revelation, and a fine companion piece to End of the Century, the edgier and uglier history of another post-Dolls band, The Ramones.The late Johnny Thunders didn\\'t write You Can\\'t Put Your Arms Around a Memory until after the Dolls had broken up, but this lovely little heartbreaker of a movie takes the sentiment as its own.[A] respectful and subtle look at the difference faith can make in one\\'s life.Becomes a lovely portrait of a man coming back to himself, without forgetting what else he\\'s become.As the credits roll, New York Doll transforms from a puff piece about an aging rock star into a moving rumination on a man\\'s final grasp for redemption.Makes for a modestly touching journey.Poignant and moving, with an ending no screenwriter could improve on, New York Doll is like the best episode of VH1\\'s Bands Reunited ever.New York Doll has a killer surprise ending that may leave even hard-core punkers reaching for the Kleenex.The film paints an affectionate portrait of a wry, somewhat addled man whose hard-partying past was in stark contrast with his later life -- a fluffy cat nestles in his guitar case while he explains his nickname.Greg Whiteley\\'s small, tender documentary portrait looks at life after rock \\'n\\' roll as experienced by the original bassist for the New York Dolls.As journeys go, this is one to treasure.A funny, exhilarating and ultimately bittersweet paean to an era and a man.Surely there have been filmmakers who knew less about music going into their first music documentary than Greg Whiteley, but none springs to mind.A tender take on life after stardom.Poves that Mormonism and makeup-adorned punk rock aren\\'t oil and water entities.A charmer. Will it be heartbreak or triumph for the Roosevelt Roughriders? You will care, passionately.Girls have hoop dreams too. And dreams can come true at the final buzzer.[The film] covers seven years and touches on some of the same social issues that gave Hoop Dreams its epic sweep, yet Serrill fails to treat any of them adequately, and the narrative loses its shape as events unfold.The intrusive narration, from hip hopper Chris \\'Ludacris\\' Bridges, offers little sense of real lives unfolding, more of a way being paved to an, admittedly tense, all-American triumph-over-adversity climax.Boredom and irritation set in early with this shallow, parochial and blandly celebratory documentary about a US high-school girls\\' basketball team, of frankly limited interest to non-US audiences.It\\'s packed with left-field twists and turns and culminates in a genuinely nail-biting match where old rivalries come to a head. In the end, it\\'s all you can do not to stand up and cheer.It shifts focus too often to hang together as an in-depth portrait of either the unconventional coach or his headstrong star player.Emotional, uplifting, vexing and infuriating, it\\'s the first basketball documentary worthy of being compared to 1994\\'s Hoop Dreams.Sketchy as it can be at times, The Heart of the Game keeps us involved.An exhausting and thoroughly entertaining tale of race, fair play, loyalty, pregnancy and the true spirit of amateur athletics.Darnellia is an inspiring and engaging heroine, and her story speaks volumes about the marginalization of women\\'s athletics.It\\'s almost impossible to refrain from cheering as if you were right there in the stands.Its squeak-and-sweat athleticism, its tough, bruised, big-hearted players and its electrifying championship countdowns should appeal to anyone who loves the game.Anybody who doesn\\'t find themselves on the edge of their seat for this film\\'s final minutes shouldn\\'t be going to movies.[The Roughriders] persevere, as did director Serrill, who took his time to find the real heart of this game.Serrill, making his feature debut, didn\\'t plan on spending seven years with the Roughriders. But reality just kept getting more compelling and complicated, and his persistence paid off.This is a movie about empowerment, integrity and having fun, and those are always in season.Most certainly, it will make you root for the Roughriders on and off the court.An exhilarating story of loyalty and perseverance, The Heart of the Game succeeds as both inspiration and social commentary.You\\'ll be smiling and happy as you leave the The Heart of the Game, with a newfound respect for girls\\' basketball and those who play it. It works as a portrait of a father-son relationship that\\'s awkward, volatile, uneven and always painfully real.A desperately sad look at two men whose determination to rebel against their heritage and succeed in their artform has rendered them unable to communicate. Compelling stuff, though.With dad calling junior\\'s filmmaking skills into question at every turn, this is a fascinating blend of fact and friction.What we really get from son Mark\\'s unusual take is a sterling movie about fathers (especially famous fathers) and offspring.[A] tremendously moving documentary.A real gem of a film.A vivid picture of a relationship that, like most, isn\\'t quite picture-perfect.A lively, often hilarious yet profoundly moving experience.What makes this movie deeply fascinating is the fight Haskell wages. As the semi-willing subject of this movie, he\\'s determined to gain the upper hand or, at least, come out somewhat sympathetic.The strength of Tell Them Who You Are is its honesty in showing how the younger man faces the protean force that sired him, cheated on his mother, called him stupid, despised his politics and yet through it all, somehow, still loved him.The film holds steady and rarely asks for pity.Part history, part biography, part appreciation, and all therapy, it is a funny, wrenching, profound, and deeply moving film.It\\'s a welcome, honest assessment of a powerful and industry-connected father and his just-wants- to-be-himself son.An engaging and perceptive documentary.As personally troublesome as they may be, the prickly dynamics keep the docu bobbing along.A stunning personal document -- funny, touching, vital.Beneath its exploration of fatherly distance, this is really a portrait of why cranks make better artists than earnest nice guys.Tell Them Who You Are is fascinating for the issues -- ethical, aesthetic, psychoanalytic -- it raises. But it doesn\\'t fully come together.It\\'s a case in which the director should have put his ego and personal issues aside to create a more conventional life story.Tell them Who You Are is breezy and informative. It offers a view of the talented, opinionated man that only his son could pull off. []A flat-lined, pedestrian affair, a talking-heads/ touring-heads piece that seems to point the camera in the wrong direction.A personalized, historically charged travelogue that speaks to a massive tragedy\\'s impact on one man.A tragic reminder of how that overused epithet, \\'Never again\\', makes hypocrites of us all.In a way, Shake Hands With the Devil puts the best of Western conscience on display -- and it\\'s not a pretty sight.We never get a satisfying re-creation of the events for which Dallaire now suffers.Offers a rare and privileged portrait of a heroic man profoundly troubled by a terrible experience.Poses an essential question: How can you shame an international community that, even now, seems constitutionally incapable of it?Raymont\\'s film, with Dallaire as the main voice and news footage from 1994, lays out a compelling, compact story.The filmmakers follow this compassionate and articulate man as returns to Rwanda a decade later to revisit his demons.A fascinating account of its subject\\'s self-torture over his inability to stop one of the 20th century\\'s greatest tragedies.Dallaire is not only the protagonist of Shake Hands, he is a compelling reason to see it.This wonderful, devastating documentary is as much Dallaire\\'s story as it is the story of a whole continent abandoned by a cynical world.His story is worth telling, and worth remembering for what it tells us about the West\\'s brutal disinterest in Africa, and the United Nations\\' inability to do even its most basic job of keeping the peace.Dellaire\\'s final bit of self-abuse is to blame himself for his failure to shame the world to action.Peter Raymont\\'s film is a respectful portrait of Romo Dallaire, the Canadian commander of the United Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda in 1994.Romeo Dallaire seems to be the only human in the world with a conscience. That it\\'s eating him alive makes Shake Hands required viewing, perhaps even at the UN.Shake Hands is less about one man than about a U.N. structurally incapable of carrying out its peacekeeping mandate, then and now.It gives us a man who could have stopped the carnage -- 800,000 murdered in 100 days -- but whose hands were bound at the highest level. He knows this, it haunts him, and if it doesn\\'t shame you, it should.Extols the power of truth over fiction. Gunner Palace isn\\'t a particularly violent movie...but every moment is fraught with the potential for violence.[]Tucker takes it all in without taking a stand, though his sympathies -- expressed through voiceover narration -- clearly lie with the men and women in the field.You certainly can\\'t question Tucker\\'s bravery, but you may occasionally feel the urge to ask him to be quiet.While Gunner Palace has the immediacy of street rap, it is actually a throwback to the cinema verite style of pioneering documentarians D.A. Pennebaker, Albert Maysles and Frederick Wiseman.But they\\'re very good at documenting the tedium of the place and the work, the banal dangers of an occupation where the enemy could be anyone.The film\\'s strength -- and its weakness -- is in its you-are-there view of guys who are e-mailing their loved ones back home one minute and breaking down the doors of Iraqi homes the next, on the hunt for the enemy.Gunner Palace succeeds as a series of snapshots of the post-war landscape ...Reminds you that the thousands of faceless, nameless troops in Iraq are still there after you switch off CNN.A bit disjointed but accomplishes its mission: to provide a glimpse into the soldiers\\' everyday lives without taking a side on the war.A doc that doesn\\'t quite live up to its premise but still manages to go beyond packaged news and into the often surreal days and nights of soldiers in a strange, modern war.Jammed with information and serious testimony, giving a detailed and textured account of what it\\'s like to be fighting the war more than a year after victory was declared.Works purely as a series of complex snapshots of the conflict in Iraq.This film is so valuable. Not because it argues a position about the war and occupation, but because it simply goes and observes as soldiers work and play, talk and write letters home and, on a daily basis, risk their lives in sudden bursts of violence.One of the most frightening aspects of the movie is the random feeling it conveys. Another is the shock of seeing such very young soldiers, many of them teenagers, caught up in a war they don\\'t really understand.We don\\'t get to know the soldiers as individuals well enough.Invaluable if incomplete.Director Michael Tucker has accomplished something difficult, making a casual though often intense film in the midst of a war zone.Suggests the primacy of movies in shaping both the reality that led these soldiers to enlist and the one they found in Iraq when they got there.A timely and pertinent, if rough-hewn, effort. A much more sanguine view of cultural diversity emerges in this enchanting documentary...what Mad Hot Ballroom lacks in depth, it more than makesup for in charm and vibrancy.It will sweep you off your feet.Cute, comical kids help make this ballroom dancing comp-romp a feelgood winner despite inexpert editing.Charming if slightly overlong.It\\'s a tale of tears, triumph and tread-upon toes; it may wear you out, but it\\'ll put a spring in your step too.[Its] heart shines through during conversational scenes with the candid children.There\\'s not a sequin, an ostrich feather nor a miniature tuxedo in sight, and everybody who gets anywhere near the finals looks absolutely right.Listening to the kids talk is a treat in itself, but watching them strut their stuff in the final competition is enough to make you stand up and cheer.In contrast to its great title, Mad Hot Ballroom is anything but: Let\\'s just say I was not spellbound.It\\'s kind of like the dance version of that documentary Rock School.The kids are adorable, and so is the movie.Clearly, the dance lessons are life lessons as well, nurturing self-confidence, team spirit, the joy of dancing and even a slight touch of Old World etiquette in an otherwise too-busy- to-be-courteous world.Director Marilyn Agrelo\\'s Mad Hot Ballroom is the best documentary bar-none since 1994\\'s seminal basketball saga Hoop Dreams.Aside from being perfectly irresistible, the movie is also deeply inspiring, especially for children.The film\\'s unintentional revelation may be that the competition isn\\'t near as important as the education. The trophy is only a faint shadow of what has been accomplished.Wins you over with kid after kid after kid saying the darndest things about boys and girls, winning and losing, and a host of other issues.For director Marilyn Agrelo and screenwriter Amy Sewell, the documentary is a beautifully realized first effort. For the documented youngsters, it\\'s a celebration of their stamina, tenacity and unforced lovability.It\\'s a dynamic snapshot of youth in the big city, of kids who talk tough and act up but savor the discipline and structure of their dance classes.Mad Hot Ballroom had me at \\'... and go!\\'This engaging look at New York City school kids who learn ballroom dancing and participate in citywide competitions gains impact from watching kids learning unexpected skills. [][][F]or all its mis-steps, Rize gets by on enough jumping, pumping energy to fuel the national grid.It\\'s a well-known truth in the dance world that the body doesn\\'t lie. As long as the characters in this film are dancing, we have little reason to doubt their sincerity. But once turned into talking heads, the dancers begin to sound like propagandists.A vivid portrait of art rising from deprivation and social hopelessness.Dancers move at the speed of lightening, the camera almost unable to keep up with some of the motion, it nearly mutating into a giant spectacularly vigorous blur.LaChapelle\\'s powerful street-dance documentary Rize never lets us forget that its subjects are dancing in a war zone. But dance they do, in a kind of controlled frenzy, with music throbbing and limbs whirling and swaying and pulsing to the beat.With a running time of only 84 minutes, Rize frequently feels padded. However, there\\'s no denying the fascination of watching these bodies in motion and the ascendency of a new, American-born art form.[LaChapelle\\'s] not the world\\'s best documentarian, but he saw something that needed chronicling. So he turned his camera on the krumpers and let them do the rest. Smart choice.Clowning and krumping are urban art and art therapy in motion.It\\'s a feel-good film that actually makes you feel good.It\\'s an incomplete film. We don\\'t get to know these kids well enough.LaChapelle reveals the captivating qualities of gritty street dancing, and his film is a touching story of hope, vitality and art rising from the bleakest conditions.While the dance scenes are intoxicating, on-camera interviews with the participants are sobering.\\'Trend\\' or fad, Rize should endure as a piece of history.Brisk editing, a poppin\\' hip-hop soundtrack, and plenty of off-the-hook dancing keep the energy high.Rize is actually a film about how art can be subverted and perverted by the same social and internal pressures that spawned it in the first place.Rize soars on the wings of breathtaking images.Rize isn\\'t a revolution. It\\'s a fashion shoot.David LaChapelle\\'s documentary is, in its happiest moments, a summer party and a hip-hop milestone. A sharp documentary that has comedy, tragedy and, yes, a glimpse of Linda Lovelace\\'s party trick.Bailey and Barbato can only scratch the Boogie Nights-influenced surface, but they cover the ABCs of pornography with undeniable zip.[A] valuable document of a cultural shift.Interviews with the surviving players, including porn stud Harry Reams ... make for entertaining viewing.Fascinating social criticism and a witty and relevant take on American sexual history.The absorption of Deep Throat into the political melodrama that was Watergate seems to have led to some grandiose statements in Messrs. Bailey and Barbato\\'s documentary.It just doesn\\'t go deep enough.Bailey and Barbato aren\\'t as interested in the picture itself as they are in the people who made it, a collection of hustlers, crackpots, cranks and stooges colorful enough to inspire Elmore Leonard.A better film than its subject.Above all, the film is a lively, music-filled social history.Deep Throat bore an X certificate. Inside Deep Throat is an NC-17. Neither is suitable for grownups.Although the film starts out with a clear thesis, by the time its 90 minute running length has expired, it is grasping at themes and topics that are beyond the limited scope of what a superficial documentary can achieve.Provides a lot of background information and period color, while arguing for the film\\'s place as the breakthrough sex movie of all time.Might be more entertaining than instructive, but it manages to return us to a time when the world seemed crazy in a different sort of way.The movie will set off a slew of new questions.A fascinating look back both at a time when sex wasn\\'t discussed in polite circles, and at Deep Throat itself.Offers a diverting tale of erstwhile indie filmmaking and the power of porn to generate change -- both at the box office and in the bedroom.Bailey and Barbato aren\\'t interested in classic documentary filmmaking. They\\'re trendy dabblers in waste management, picking through the pop-culture trash to see what they can recycle for kitsch value.While brisk, informative, and entertaining, feels frustratingly sketchy.It\\'s a good blueprint for people who don\\'t know about the movie and what a huge impact it had. It doesn\\'t do much more than that. Yes, the work they\\'re doing is mind-boggling and important, but sometimes the images alone are more than capable of speaking for themselves.That IMAX 3-D cameras have plunged so deep to record an often bizarre array of sea creatures undoubtedly delivers a certain \\'wow\\' factor, but the accompanying commentary is heavier on breathless excitement than solid fact.The final shot, in particular, is awesome, and confirms that the sooner Cameron gets back to making proper movies, instead of Boys\\' Own diversions, the better.A master showman\\'s large-format documentary, a movie with great images, great special effects and the sheen of Hollywood often missing in these museum or science-center movies.The experience is so immediate and immersive that you actually feel as if you are swimming with the krill.Here we know only that Cameron and his bright-eyed young scientists (who take turns narrating) are heading to the deeper parts of the Atlantic and Pacific to observe the environment and life-forms down there.The first two-thirds of Aliens of the Deep offer a fascinating peek into earth\\'s mysteries.Often thrilling.It\\'s fantastic stuff.Visually, this is another leap for 3D and robotic cameras.An educational and thoroughly entertaining documentary that\\'s in the Everest class of great IMAX movies.Cameron\\'s showmanship and his on-screen appearances make his documentaries far livelier than your usual IMAX nature documentary, and this one is no exception.We\\'re treated to more intramural banter and golly-gee chatter among the crew than we can use, and are not given enough scientific information.Less focused thematically than its predecessor, the Titanic film Ghosts of the Abyss, Aliens of the Deep is nonetheless a visually enthralling undersea travelogue.Beyond a doubt the biggest movie ever made about shrimp, Aliens of the Deep is a technical marvel that still manages to fall somewhere severely south of marvelous.Both dazzling underwater ballet and a welcome salvo for clarity in the current backlash against evolution.Not a scientific documentary so much as a journey to an alien world, and basically what we want to do is peer out the portholes along with the explorers.One sign of a successful IMAX outing is how it makes you believe you are there in every frame, and this one does.A grandiose hybrid of undersea documentary and outer-space fantasy.The 48-minute spellbinder will make your jaw drop with awe. And, like the best documentaries, it will also make you think. The first feel-good movie made out of fecal matter.This all-star open-mike night loses its luster before its own loud laughter dies down.With a showman\\'s respect for the power of the build-up, Provenza touts his product thoroughly before unveiling it.A stunning comedy masterclass. For those with strong stomachs, obviously...... The Aristocrats proves that sometimes you don\\'t have to be a great filmmaker to make a great documentary.Within a single joke, The Aristocrats unlocks an entire universe of comedy.The film has the feel of a long and fascinating chat rather than a formal thesis. But if it feels a little self-congratulatory at times, that\\'s a small price to pay.What the film really reveals is the role of the comedian in society and the craftsmanship of joke-writing and joke delivery.In comedy, as in life, it\\'s the journey, not the outcome, that proves most fascinating.Let me reiterate. This movie is really, really dirty.See it if you aren\\'t too jaded to appreciate a few laughs in these mostly mirthless times.Exudes cheerfulness and expansive joy.Like The Joke after which it is named, it\\'s easily dismissed.For my taste, the joke is a little too scatological for comfort.Under normal circumstances, nothing kills a joke faster than trying to explain it. Yet here, such examination is the film\\'s strong suit and provides much-needed respite, quite frankly, from the exhaustion of constant laughter.If the Marquis de Sade had set The 120 Days of Sodom in a Catskills club, the result might have been something like The Aristocrats.It\\'s very funny, but it\\'s also a bit dull.Like the joke, the filmmakers keep their movie alive, not by changing any of the fundamentals but by finding new ways to embroider the basic material.I laughed myself blue.The joke itself is not very funny: It\\'s the delivery, the invention and grossness each comedian brings to it that makes it funny. []It\\'s like Spinal Tap, only shorter.So overpowering is Green\\'s outsized, needy, arrested-adolescent personality (while you initially suspect he\\'s playing for the camera, the blas attitude of his students suggests he really is like this), it throws the movie off-balance.Their playing is terrific, but there\\'s little doubt the kids are fulfilling Green\\'s fantasy rather than the other way around.Paul Green seems more interested in what rock school can do for him than for the kids.Green\\'s heart, if not his head, seems in the right place. He\\'s carrying the torch and holding it high, and his students seem to dig it.I don\\'t know what it means that rock \\'n\\' roll has become a bona fide after-school activity, but Rock School definitely kept my attention.Succeeds as a riveting movie because it doesn\\'t try to lead us from verse to an obvious chorus about Green, or his uniquely abusive methods.Rock fans will likely find the cast of characters and its \\'berlord\\' founder compelling.The relationship between the talent-challenged Will and the punishing Green makes for one of the film\\'s meatier dramatic threads.Director Don Argott does a superb job of capturing this unique institution and this great teacher.Green is a grim martinet, given to chair-throwing tantrums and fits of temper that look suspiciously choreographed for the camera.Engrossing from its first shot to its final fade.Hilarious, inspired, frenzied.Raw and funny documentary.The narrative moves quickly and the characters are so much fun, that there\\'s little time for inventory of what\\'s missing.As a portrait of dysfunctional pedagogy, it\\'s both refreshing and more than a little terrifying.Exuberant and surprisingly unsettling documentary.A rousing, garage-band-style documentary.With its encomiums to Green and its feel-good finale in Germany, Rock School sometimes threatens to succumb to Mad Hot Ballroom syndrome... But Argott weaves a darker thread into the movie ... The polemical is never as powerful as the personal and O\\'Grady\\'s part of the story illuminates the whole with nauseating clarity.Deliver Us Evil is more terrifying than any horror movie, because it\\'s about something that really happened.Watching Amy Berg\\'s powerful documentary Deliver Us from Evil is a wrenching experience; her subjects reveal to the camera almost unbearable levels of anguish, and its audience walks away feeling both numbness and rage.Works best when it concentrates on O\\'Grady and the ever-rippling effect of his transgressions.Deliver Us From Evil has a few things wrong with it, including an egregious musical score, but without resorting to sucker punches, it takes your breath away while making your skin crawl.A stunning indictment of institutional betrayal. It plays like a Catholic Watergate, going right to the top with hard evidence that stuns, dismays and sickens.The church declined to comment to Berg. Her film speaks volumes about its silence -- and about a wrong that can never be righted.What truly sets Deliver Us from Evil apart from other documentaries is interviews with the monster himself.Even people who reject the idea of inherent evil may be shaken by Berg\\'s scrupulous yet passionate recounting of the story of Oliver O\\'Grady.Deals with emotionally charged material, so it should surprise no one that it includes one of the most wrenching moments ever captured on film.After watching this film, you will believe that evil exists on earth. That the movie deals in truth and established facts makes it all the more disturbing.If Berg\\'s movie were a newspaper story, it would win the Pulitzer Prize for public service.In a major coup, director Amy Berg convinced O\\'Grady to appear in [Deliver Us From Evil], and his testimony reveals a man who\\'s chillingly divorced from the full weight of his actions.It cries from and for the hearts of victims and leaves its viewers moved, shattered, outraged. And impotent in the face of the ugliness visited on the souls of good and innocent people.One of the best and most important documentaries you\\'ll ever see.A literally stunning documentary.This superb documentary about the Catholic Church\\'s worst pedophile scandal is in many ways far scarier than any fiction.O\\'Grady appears in the film, his face showing no sign of shame even as he acknowledges and describes the awful things he did.Grander statements aren\\'t needed when the specific indictments are so plentiful and so horrifying.Neither sensationalistic nor sentimental, Ms. Berg\\'s film is clear-sighted, tough-minded and devastating, a portrait of individual criminality and institutional indifference, a study in the betrayal of trust and the irresponsibility of authority. The unnerving documentary is all the more necessary, and all the more shocking, in its immediacy.They expected tension; what they didn\\'t expect was to serve out their year-long deployment as, essentially, the world\\'s most targeted grocery store security.This is an important film, but be prepared for shocks.Arguably the most vital and eye-opening documentary yet made regarding the United States\\' current military entanglement.The film succeeds because of its refreshingly low-key emotional approach and its refusal to impose character arcs or political agendas on its subjects\\' footage.As raw and disturbing as it is wry and satirical, the resulting portrait is a powerfully unique film that goes beyond commenting on Operation Iraqi Freedom to become a provocative meditation on war itself.The film is one of the most urgent and immediate nonfiction works we may ever see.No matter what you think of the U.S. presence in Iraq, the film will disturb or startle or dismay you.A remarkable film, a you-are-there document that allows us to worry about the soldier who\\'s risking his life even as we ponder the rights and wrongs of this military engagement.The documentary camera has made repeated trips to occupied Iraq, but never to such raw and honest effect as in The War Tapes.An absolutely spellbinding first-person documentary of regular soldiers in the Iraq War, as seen through digital cameras carried into combat.No matter where one stands on the political map, no matter what one\\'s views of Operation Iraqi Freedom and its aftermath, this film is compelling, troubling and illuminating.Director Deborah Scranton, co-producer and editor Steve James and co-producer Robert May managed to assemble the immense footage into a taut, often searing 97 minutes.Moriarty, Pink and Bazzi sent back tape loaded with visual and audio detail, but the most moving moments of The War Tapes are their attempts to make sense of Operation Iraqi Freedom II.A fascinating chronicle of wartime, told by several distinct and vivid narrators.At its best, The War Tapes serves as an exploration of the soldier mentality -- or at least of the mentality of the folks who\\'d volunteer to go to Iraq.When it\\'s over, you\\'re not any closer to understanding the war. What stays with you are three sobering and complicated examples of its effect on the troops.What it does do, with grim and often gruesome honesty, is show the realities of war to a public that has been largely shielded from its cost.For The War Tapes, Scranton supplied mini-DV cameras to several soldiers and asked them to record as much as they could of their year in Iraq, even if it meant attaching the equipment to helmets and gun-sights and just letting the tape roll.A gripping documentary that takes embedding pretty much right inside the soldiers\\' brains. You wouldn\\'t believe it as fiction but it really is fairly unadorned fact. It is easy to see awards beckoning, and deservedly so because Walker as a film-maker never puts herself in front of her extraordinary subjects.How they managed the trek defies belief, but in an art-form where superpowers have become pass??, it\\'s a stirring reminder of what human powers, against the odds, can achieve.Lucy Walker\\'s documentary Blindsight is breathtaking twice over. It leaves the audience gasping like a landed guppy at views of snow-coddled Himalayan peaks under ice-blue skies.Lucy Walker\\'s documentary is genuinely stirring.Walker\\'s ending is fudged both in terms of the narrative and the issues, and she seems to come down, a little feebly, on the \"heartwarming\" side of things. But what an amazing, and bizarre, story.A strikingly photographed documentary that unfolds into a story of human achievement and a study of the East-West culture clash.Blindsight is a great example of the emotional dividends that careful photography, sensitive editing and an atmospheric score can deliver.Uplifting but never mawkish, and gorgeously shot.To see how these conflicts play out, to see how both sides came to realize that they had unexpected things to learn from these remarkable young people, is where Blindsight really makes its mark.Coying and manipulative.It is a truly one-of-a-kind story of survival, persistence and achievement, and by the time it was over I was moved so thoroughly beyond words I almost didn\\'t know what to do next.You take them with you as you leave the theater, knowing that your bad day probably isn\\'t as rough as you first thought and inspiring the realization that anyone can climb the peaks of their own lives. It\\'s a must-see.Walker captures all the dreamy-scary beauty of Everest\\'s upper reaches, as well as numerous mini-dramas about the kids\\' readiness to approach the summit.The film is often breathtakingly beautiful, and even as the students triumph over the naysayers, it\\'s melancholy knowing they aren\\'t sharing viewers\\' experiences of their starkly gorgeous world.Simultaneously a sports adventure film, a tear-jerking tale of hope and inspiration and a captivating meditation on culture clash.Blindsight is hugely affecting, the rare experience that will make those who watch it thankful for what they have, yet make them realize that they aren\\'t nearly thankful enough.The film overcomes its crude production values and awkward structuring. It stirs you.Blindsight makes us consider an apparent paradox that, for the blind, is the philosophical starting point of their day: how to see things the human eye won\\'t register.Lucy Walker\\'s observant film Blindsight is about profound East-West differences in the importance of journey versus destination and comradeship versus competition.There are enough good stories for three movies in Lucy Walker\\'s Blindsight, an exhilarating trip with six blind Tibetan teenagers as they scale one of the highest peaks in the Himalayas. This seventh installment is utterly fascinating, drawing heavily on footage from the previous movies to follow each child on the journey into middle age.Michael Apted\\'s Up series remains one of the great imaginative leaps in film.I can think of no single movie, fictional or factual, that more strongly awakens our common humanity or that establishes such a marvelous, tight bond with its characters.The segments are so cleverly arranged -- [director Michael Apted] includes past pictorial references for each of the people we revisit -- that now there is something almost mystical involved.But a funny thing happened on the way to the class-warfare lecture: Most of the subjects got on with living their lives, ignoring their class distinctions in the process.I\\'ll wait breathlessly for 56 Up, and hope this brave group will speak to the camera again; giving us the gift of a share in their lives.On the cusp of their half-century mark, Apted\\'s British subjects have accommodated themselves to what they were, what they are, and what they will be.Whether we actually \\'know\\' these individuals or not is beside the point; we feel we do, and this enriches the experience of watching the most ambitious documentary project ever committed to celluloid.The latest riveting, heartbreaking chapter to one of the supreme creations of documentary filmmaking, the 7 Up series.Taken as a whole, these films constitute one of the greatest uses of cinema a documentary filmmaker has ever devised. Like the other films in the series, 49 Up is alternately touching and mundane.Dropping by on the same people every seven years like an old friend -- or an unwelcome relative -- Apted has constructed a peerless, suspenseful work that develops character to a depth that would make Tolstoy jealous.When I saw 42 Up in 1999, I thought the series had run its natural course and that it was time to leave the \"kids\" alone. I was wrong. They have just entered a new and exciting phase of lives that are very much works in progress.I won\\'t bother you with all the particulars because that would steal the film\\'s thunder. Know, though, that Apted includes enough footage from previous films to remind us of details we may have forgotten.49 Up marks the latest chapter in one of the most ambitious documentary projects in movie history. Make that the history of any medium, for how often do we get to witness a time-lapse study of human life?If the purpose of the Up series has been to show how class determines destiny in the UK, then what we\\'ve actually learned is that everyone there gets a fair shot to make it to the middle.They\\'re both fascinating and timeless, and like the hopes and dreams we carry with us from the day we\\'re born to the day we die Apted\\'s series captures humanity at every spectrum of its evolution.This long documentary is captivating. Not because you\\'re peeking at lives of real people, but because it captures the way time heals all wounds and how people find a way out of deep holes if they are determined to do so.More than a deeply satisfying movie; it\\'s a reminder of the wonder contained in ordinary lives.A deeply moving meditation on the natural evolution of existence.The films have taken on an autumnal shade as we revisit people who seem quietly aware that the years behind them are more than those ahead. A Tantalus glimpse of what America might have been with a president who cared about the planet, its people and its peace.It grabs you like a thriller with an ending that will haunt your dreams.Just because truths are inconvenient is no reason to suppose they are not real.An eco-horror movie that is anything but escapist entertainment...t\\'s an enduring irony of movies that one guy talking can be more compelling than a million dollars in locations, extras and effects.Powerful, intelligent and surprisingly entertaining, Gore presents a compelling case. You\\'ll believe a film can change the world.It is utterly convincing, it\\'s emotionally powerful and it makes Gore look more charming than he ever did as a presidential candidate.Despite or perhaps because of Gore\\'s schoolmasterly attitudes, his arguments have force. A kind of anti-charisma sees it through.Cinematic brussel sprouts.The show is lively and heartfelt - a persuasive call to action.The film succeeds powerfully, even though it\\'s short on practical solutions, makes some questionable statements of fact and, given Gore\\'s current ambiguous position in public life, requires a tighter focus on the message than on the messenger.Frightening and timely, the smartly organized documentary is an urgent plea for responsibility and action as well as an impassioned call to heed the ominous warnings of science.A film that invests hard science with impassioned moral drive.Matter of fact, it\\'s surprisingly entertaining, if ultimately shocking.Communicates the dangers of ignoring global warning with credible urgency in a way news coverage of conferences and TV news segments have never been able to do.Will likely make you admire Al Gore a little more than you already do, worry about the planet a lot more than you already do, and finally, leave you with as many questions as when you started.Despite quibbles over details, the case [Gore] presents is compelling, and anyone who isn\\'t sure whether global warming is a mounting crisis or a massive hoax should see this film.Like an inventive and engrossing lecture by your favorite eighth-grade science teacher, making it an engaging movie, whatever your politics.The clarity and simplicity of the presentation is remarkable. Gore is a likable, confident, humorous speaker. And the material reminds us of the need for vigilance.It will be interesting to watch how skeptics will deal with Gore\\'s bad news on the environment without making themselves look very small. Boy, was I wrong. There\\'s more palm-sweating suspense in one minute of this baby than in all of The Omen.Even though these puzzles are mapped out with utmost precision -- and even though logic is an extremely useful tool for solving them -- they\\'re still, somehow, objects of intrigue and mystery.A playful, informative and very sweet documentary about the world of words \\'across\\' or \\'down.\\'The fact that Wordplay works as a film at all is a testament to its skill.It manages to turn an internal, solitary activity into fodder for an engaging, even exciting movie.There\\'s a surface satisfaction to Wordplay that\\'s absolutely undeniable. But there are also just enough smarts here to make you wish for something more.Manages to present lively and entertaining portraits of men and women who think in boxes while working outside of them.Thankfully, just when you\\'re ready to nod off, Stewart comes back. Watching him attack the Times with his pen and screaming \\'Bring it!\\' is worth the price of admission.A sincere, comprehensive look at the inside world of hardcore crossword puzzling.What\\'s an eight-letter word for a non-fiction feature that is witty, wise and wonderful?Every bit as smart as the Times puzzles, puzzlemakers and puzzle solvers.Wordplay captures the exhilaration that comes from navigating the ins and outs of complex puzzles. It also celebrates the English language in a way that is stimulating and immensely entertaining.An exhilarating celebration of a national pastime.Engaging documentary that opens up a world of words.Even if you\\'ve never done a crossword in your life or been frustrated by the attempt, you will likely be drawn into this intriguing world through the enthusiasm expressed by its adherents.A light, breezy documentary that introduces us to a genial gang of crossword puzzle fans whose passion for the pastime is gleefully infectious.A film so crammed with characters and quirks that you\\'ll smile all the way home.The film is made with a lot of style and visual ingenuity.The most minor entry in the brainiac-doc genre to date, it\\'s nevertheless a perfectly entertaining hour and a half for crossword adepts.Writer and director Patrick Creadon makes us care about this passionate cast and finds visually inventive ways to illustrate the players\\' thought processes. []The details just get stranger and stranger.As directed by Louise Osmond and Jerry Rothwell, the movie breezes along at a highly watchable clip, thanks to fluid, affecting intercutting of archival, black-and-white footage and present-day interviews.The film evokes a visceral understanding of solitude at sea.Some beautiful shots give unexpected texture to the film, such as an underwater capture of a boat from below, with prisms of light surrounding it. And its final image is a quiet heartbreaker.For this gripping and amazing documentary, such truth emerges not just from the facts, but also the poetry of men who redefine themselves in a risky race on small sailboats.Deep Water is a stunning documentary that not only beautifully elucidates a nearly forgotten incident but touches on crucial themes involving isolation, sanity, self-worth, impossible dreams, the nature of heroism and limits of human endurance.One of this year\\'s better studies of the human soul.Osmond and Rothwell do a commendable job of mining a rich archive of material.Osmond and Rothwell\\'s depiction of his unraveling is an exquisitely structured drama.To reveal Crowhurst\\'s decision would be to spoil a stunning tale. Deep Water is not itself comparably stunning.Despite the flaws in the structure and story of Deep Water, Osmond and Rothwell display great skill at keeping their audience informed.Remarkable.A fascinating documentary about the first single-handed around-the-world sailing race, begins like a Boy\\'s Own adventure tale but ends up more akin to tragedy.Deep Water is a documentary, but it\\'s also one part adventure film, one part Greek tragedy, and one part meditation on the role of the \\'hero\\' in modern society.An enthralling documentary about an Englishman named Donald Crowhurst who, in 1968, set off on a solitary, nonstop circumnavigation of the globe.A spooky, moving doc that chronicles the first solo attempt to circle the world by boat.His story is a footnote in sailing history, to be sure, but a fascinating one.A true-life tale of inadvertent self-destruction, Deep Water\\'s generic title belies its haunting incisiveness.Given that the tedium of months on the open seas could and did drive a man insane, co-directors Louise Osmond and Jerry Rothwell have done a commendable job of making Deep Water... well, not boring. []Yes, there\\'s a little preachiness here, but it doesn\\'t puncture the party mood. Or stop Chappelle telling dirty jokes about prostitutes, for that matter. Thanks to him this isn\\'t just a musical feast, but a rib-busting comedy too.Chappelle keeps things lively, joking on camera, punctuating the acts with gags , while Michel Gondry maintains our interest, focusing as much on Chappelle\\'s energy and wit, and goings-on behind the scenes, as the gig itself.This is effectively an inner-city Woodstock -- only funny.I want to see another hour of Dave Chappelle\\'s Block Party.A return to rowdy form.No one enjoys the free festivities more than Chappelle, who wanders through the film like a kid on Christmas morning. A very funny kid.Chappelle\\'s talent and the characters in the movie give it a universal appeal, even to those unfamiliar with hip-hop.It\\'s intermittently funny, but it peaks too soon and runs far too long. And for all its length, Block Party doesn\\'t tell us much about Chappelle that we haven\\'t seen before.Block Party makes for a transcendent experience.The music is angry and the jokes are raw but, ultimately, Block Party conveys a positive message to audiences. Instead of competition, we see collaboration between the artists and unity in the diverse crowd.Strictly for fans of the musical acts and those who think everything Chappelle does is genius.The genius of what Gondry and Chappelle accomplish is to make the music, the setting and the people soaking it all in universal for everyone no matter who they are or what their background.While unlikely to enter the annals of great concert filmmaking, Dave Chappelle\\'s Block Party does capture the moment at hand with a breezy, offhanded and utterly user-friendly charm.There are just enough provocative notes hit for \"Block Party\" to stand out as more than just a frivolous good time (though it can be enjoyed in that way as well).Once in a great while there\\'s a movie that\\'s so funny, infectious and welcoming - a movie that makes you feel so good about America and the people in it - you just want to climb inside the screen and live there.Watching the concert on screen is almost as good as being there.His racial jokes have an edge, but they are not as deadly as the Chappelle\\'s Show skits.Gangly, disarming and slyly witty, Chappelle is at ease with people of all ages and races, and has a knack for finding humour without forcing it....an off-the-wall celebration that mixes humor and music to amusing, if not life-changing, effect. Jonestown is a somber and non-exploitive reconstruction of the events that led the members of the Peoples Temple.Stanley Nelson revisits the 1978 mass suicide of Jim Jones and his flock in Guyana, savoring the horror but offering no new insights.Ultimately, the film doesn\\'t entirely answer the massive \\'why\\' at the center of this story -- that answer died on that day in 1978 -- but it\\'s a haunting exploration of an event of unspeakable sadness, which still resonates decades later.A somber, solid documentary [parading] the whole bleak tale before us again, complete with those disturbing scenes of hundreds of corpses in their tees and shorts and flip-flops strewn about facedown in the mud of Jonestown, Guyana.The last half hour of Jonestown is almost unwatchable. Video footage of the assault on the congressman\\'s delegation gives way to audio of Jones exhorting people to \\'die with a degree of dignity\\' as children shriek in the background.Jonestown is not an easy movie to watch. But it\\'s a solid presentation of an important chapter in American and religious history. Haunting is the only word that truly fits.Jonestown is a thoroughly conventional documentary...But this familiar format also emphasizes the movie\\'s universality.One of the year\\'s most important documentaries, a real must-see.While Jonestown lacks the power of revelation, it\\'s a first-rate piece of journalism, as fascinating and thorough as any magazine article.The film says just as much about the state of American politics, the emergence of a mass media and the perceived sanctity of religion as it does about one of the world\\'s lesser-known demagogues.This calm and thorough film has just the right attitude and tone to deal with a most incendiary story.[The film] tells a remarkable tale of the rise and fall of a toxic utopia that coalesced around an increasingly certifiable leader.Director Stanley Nelson goes beyond those outlines... to give us a measure of Jones\\' appeal and surprising power....Collects declassified CIA photos, film and audiotapes made by Jones\\' followers to form an astonishingly complete picture of what happened.Jones was a charlatan who faked healings, demanded sexual favors of members and committed all sorts of criminal acts.With such a wealth of documented footage and firsthand testimony, it is unconscionable that Nelson should leave us with more questions dangling than answered.This film paints a portrait of Mr. Jones, who died with his flock in Guyana, as a man with two faces.When it comes to how those followers turned into a zombie Kool-Aid death cult, Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple leaves you with more questions than you went in with.Ending with mass suicide in deepest Guyana, the story of Jim Jones and his Peoples Temple is both the death rattle of \\'60s utopianism and -- predicated on the desire to found a New Jerusalem in the wilderness -- a very American saga.Offers a sophisticated thesis, digging into the reasons why people joined the Peoples Temple. Masterfully edited, the film combines footage the band made for its Web site and footage shot by Kopple and Peck over the last two years. The filmmakers are clearly in awe of the Chicks\\' fighting spirit.Shut Up and Sing tells the story of three young women whose belief in America is bred in the bone, and it shames their critics.I came round to them by the end, but it\\'s not a great introduction.This a frank, and slightly scary film about one of America\\'s most cherished democratic privileges - freedom of speech - and how you\\'re more than welcome to it as long as you don\\'t say anything controversial. Then you\\'re off the air.A gold statue of the Dixie Chicks should be erected in Maines\\' hometown of Lubbock, Texas.It was a throwaway scrap of a comment tossed to an audience baying with appreciation.A melodic wakeup call; where bluegrass meets grassroots politics.Exposing almost as much small-mindedness as Borat did, this provides food for thought as well as some darned good ditties.[]In today\\'s polarized America, you pick who you stand with, even in pop culture. Kopple\\'s film makes that choice stark...A superior rockumentary.A fascinating look at the intersection of commerce, celebrity, and controversy.A thoughtful and enjoyable documentary from Barbara Kopple.[Natalie Maines] makes it clear in this astonishingly candid, intimate film that she doesn\\'t think she has anything to apologize for.The fact that you might emerge from the theater eager to give their albums a listen is a testament to how effective this lively and stirring movie about freedom of speech really is.These two movies - one about family and one about freedom - never quite dovetail.The Dixie Chicks certainly don\\'t shut up, but they do sing in Shut Up & Sing; and while some may wish they\\'d done more of one or the other, there\\'s no denying the power of this documentary.The Dixie Chicks\\' struggle with the conflicting demands of art and commerce as portrayed in this documentary shows that they\\'re still not ready to make nice....[We] see the real concern as the backlash gets serious enough to prompt death threats and the affair takes its toll on band members\\' families.Whether you love or hate the outspoken Maines, you\\'ve got to give her this much: She\\'s never boring. Pleasant, but hardly pulse-quickening stuff.Shows the famed songwriter\\'s performance and work off with reverance, and a faithfullness to the live experience....Even those who haven\\'t followed Young\\'s every recent move could well find his performance here surprisingly captivating....Neil Young has experimented with film many times, but this is by far the most accessible cinematic treatment of his music; a troubadour at the top of his game.The best moments in the film are when Ellen Kuras\\'s camera just sits there taking in the whole stage, the whole gorgeous ecosystem.It doesn\\'t penetrate his craggy mystique, or make us hear his music in a new way. Instead, it\\'s the same old choir song.Vividly captures Young\\'s greatness by simply letting him do his thing.This chronicle of the human condition set to music will only rise in value and statue over time.This Prairie Wind concert is one long sweet twang of wistful not-quite-regret.When it comes to pop-music icons, Neil Young is the full package.Some defiant rockers are forever young. This one is in name only.Neil Young: Heart of Gold is one of the best live concert films ever made. If you like Neil Young, that is.It does what the best movies of any genre do: turn the produced and scripted into something sincere and honest.One of the new year\\'s most satisfying films.Like its troubadour, Heart of Gold is smart and generous with its seeming simplicity.Few artists are so adept at addressing the past and embracing the future all at once. And few recent films have so gracefully captured a musician at a specific point in his time.Neil Young: Heart of Gold, director Jonathan Demme\\'s lovingly shot document of Young\\'s August 2005 performances at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville, has to rank among the most heartfelt concert films ever made.I couldn\\'t help but wish that as long as Young was making a new film with a top-tier director at the helm, he would have provided more insight into his life, as Martin Scorsese\\'s recent TV documentary did for Bob Dylan.Heart of Gold is the work of an egalitarian lover of music. Demme uses the camera as a divining rod, pointing at the man with the guitar.If you\\'re looking for a piece of entertainment that\\'s a superlative showcase by and for one of popular music\\'s most iconic figures, search no further than Neil Young: Heart of Gold. Longley is a film-maker of intelligence and empathy.The technique is more expressionistic than naturalistic, but it makes the film far more vivid and emotionally satisfying.The film is both gritty and lyrical, showing how tanks share the Baghdad streets with donkeys as well as the quiet beauty of the Kurdish countryside.Because [director] Longley uses a technique that forgoes interviews and voiceover commentary in favour of observation and revealing juxtapositions, his movie puts you both in the chaos and just above it.Stands up as a classic war documentary, in its unusual poetic form and by its extraordinary access to the lives of ordinary Iraqis.Iraq in Fragments sometimes feels random, but it is a well-crafted, thoughtful study of the dueling divisiveness and hope that will define the region long after foreign troops leave.James Longley\\'s devastating documentary Iraq in Fragments has neither narration nor obvious political ax to grind, but it manages to tell us something about Iraq that we aren\\'t getting or can\\'t get from standard news coverage.By turns tender and shocking, Iraq in Fragments strikes a rare balance between impromptu fluidity and feature-film narrative control, in the process resisting both partisanship and predigested points of view.In addition to the interesting camera work, the documentary\\'s undeniable appeal comes in how close Longley gets to the characters, who are all male. They speak openly of the past, the U.S. forces, the uncertain future.Watch the evening news and you get a view of Iraq from high above the wreckage. In this fascinating doc, director James Longley shows us how things look on the ground.In a series of stunningly filmed sequences, Longley and his camera seek out the real lives outside the frame of conventional TV news, and he succeeds in creating both compelling journalism and superb images.There\\'s something of a period quality to this beautifully photographed documentary snapshot of Iraq in transition.Shot over three years, this is one of the more considered and insightful Iraqi documentaries - although some may find its stylistic contrasts a little self-conscious and distracting.Longley\\'s access to public and private developments in the wake of the U.S. invasion of Iraq is often stunning.The frequently gorgeous footage, culled from some 300 hours shot over a two-year period, provides ample compensation for any narrative.A documentary of stunning immediacy and marvelous images...This visually sumptuous movie richly deserves the cinematography, editing and directing prizes it carried off at Sundance last January.... this one demands to be seen.[Director] Longley shows a poetic, almost elegiacal artistry. After two years, he might not understand the Iraqi people fully, but they have won his heart and mind.Visually arresting and deeply disheartening, James Longley\\'s impressionistic documentary explores the pain of a shattered country by homing in on a few tiny shards. []Another few of these squandered opportunities for art-house muckraking and we\\'ll need someone to ask who killed the left-wing documentary.Chris Paine\\'s documentary about General Motors\\' development and withdrawal of the innovative, environment-friendly EV1 automobile is bound to reverberate with anyone who\\'s fallen in love with a product only to see it irrevocably yanked from the market.This fascinating feature-length documentary tells the shameful story of how fast, economical electric cars became a hit in California in the 1990s, then vanished almost overnight.It\\'s liable to get people hopping mad, whether or not they buy Paine\\'s overarching conspiracy theory.... an entertaining but sometimes disingenuous documentary ...An entertaining if slightly skewed documentary about the short life and early death of General Motors\\' EV1.If Chris Paine\\'s film were half as well designed as General Motors\\' super-sleek, super-quick EV1 (the electric car whose demise it laments), it would be a film to cherish.A story that deserves to be heard, but like the EV1, it\\'s a quiet achievement that should have been much louder.Paine is preaching to the choir, but the sermon should be heard nonetheless.The film\\'s clear and informative exploration of the collusion between the private sector and government agencies, along with the auto giants\\' wielding of their financial power to sway legislature, can\\'t help but raise the viewer\\'s ire.Naturally appealing to environmentalists and techno motorheads, this film\\'s story also unfolds like a good murder mystery, broadening its scope into areas such as grassroots organizing, corporate conspiracies, and governmental interference.A documentary as efficient and zippy as its subject.It posits a necessary question in these days of ever-burgeoning oil prices and ever-shrinking supply, and it offers distressing insights into the corporate American mindset.A lot of the film is illuminating; a lot of it is pointless.Paine\\'s disarmingly impassioned movie sees nothing but short-term sinister interests behind the forced disappearance of a viably long-term solution.Like An Inconvenient Truth and Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room, the movie is ultimately a nonpartisan warning.Cynical bike riders may well snicker at scenes of car-lovers behaving like tree-huggers, but Paine effectively builds the viewer\\'s affection for EV1, so the removal of the cars works as the film\\'s climactic moment.Paine\\'s movie can be a bit repetitious, but whether you regard the story as a footnote to automotive history or as a record of a tragically lost opportunity, you\\'ll find plenty of interesting material here, not to mention some cause for hope.A spirited celebration of the deceased can honor the lost opportunity even as it challenges the living, breathing, concerned survivors to demand more from corporations, government, ourselves. ... really more about the tragic effects of madness than the glory of art.Riveting even when it borders on the hagiographic.The Devil and Daniel Johnston is an unflinching yet loving look at the outsider musician\\'s life. It\\'s also the most revealing look at genius and mental illness since Terry Zwigoff\\'s 1994 documentary Crumb.A heartbreaking, yet strangely uplifting and inspirational, exploration of the fine line between genius and madness, and how sometimes, one becomes impossible to discern from the other.At the end of the day, Johnston\\'s childlike stream of unrequited love landed him on MTV, Atlantic Records, and now a feature-length theatrical recounting of his life. Take that, Satan.I found the documentary surprisingly diverting as a case study.As a demonstration of how to put a life on screen, it is exemplary in its thoroughness and willingness to allow a multiplicity of views.The troubled singer-songwriter Daniel Johnston is the subject of an entertaining documentary.Rock \\'n\\' roll\\'s capacity for recycling legend means the stories of Johnston\\'s life, and the way in which they\\'re told, could easily fall into clich. Instead they are original, engrossing and sometimes heartbreaking.Occasionally slides into a breathless fan tribute, but nonetheless an affectionate and candid portrait of a troubled artist.To share Feuerzeig\\'s loving investigation is to share an insightful study of the destructive and creative capabilities of the mind.This well-done documentary will explain why Johnston has never been able to rise above cult status ...Feuerzeig was able to fashion such a thorough, engaging film partly because aficionados such as Lee Renaldo of Sonic Youth shot so much footage of Johnston performing and acting out.Like Capturing the Friedmans, Devil is loaded with revealing footage, rife with psychodrama, including a creepy home movie in which the teenage Johnston plays himself and his overbearing mother.... an uncomfortably fascinating document of a man whose bipolar disorder and artistic ambitions are inextricably connected.Devil leads us into that dark, uncharted valley where evil, genius, divine inspiration, insanity -- and other unfathomable mysteries -- commingle.A searing, compassionate portrait of chronic mental illness.An inspired piece of work by someone who knows and admires Mr. Johnston but doesn\\'t cover up the warts. It\\'s also the rare documentary possessed with an artistry that transcends its subject.Perhaps Feuerzeig wanted to get away from the stereotypical \\'talking head\\' interview, but by having the subject stop periodically to rinse and spit?Regardless of how you feel about Johnston\\'s art, The Devil and Daniel Johnston is worth seeing as a poignant portrait of a troubled life, still in the making. Why bother with horror films when you can see this?Some lively material - but nothing new.This unabashedly liberal documentary tries to redress the balance by giving the rest of America a wake up call: not all scary fundamentalists come strapped with explosives.A brave, thoughtful documentary.Funny, sad and horrifying. Anti-fundamentalist rather than anti-Christian, this deserves to preach to more than just the converted.No matter your religious or political affiliation (or lack thereof), this supremely even-handed documentary from Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady is cinematic dynamite.It\\'s almost impossible not to respond emotionally to this fascinating, sobering and all-too-brief exploration of the politicized religious right and its hopes, dreams and power.Perhaps indoctrination is in the eye of the beholder. But one thing is certain: All Christians aren\\'t the same. I\\'m one, and I found this film to be saddening, not heartening.I spent a lot of years studying the teachings of Jesus in Catholic grammar school, and I think Jesus would be appalled by what goes on in the these camps.Jesus Camp doesn\\'t trivialize or exploit its child subjects nor their spirituality; for the most part, the film maintains a patient, unobtrusive outlook from the D.A. Pennebaker school.Both disturbing and enlightening.Jesus Camp seems to me most interesting (and poignant) as a portrait of denied and even desecrated childhood.On one level, the documentary Jesus Camp is all about evangelical Christians keeping up with the terrorists.Jesus Camp does what documentaries ought to do: It poses serious questions, then steps out of the argument.The overlap of politics and religion is precisely what gives the film an interest beyond the curious practices with which some parents raise their children.One of those documentaries so well crafted you should wonder what was left on the cutting-room floor.It might be too much to ask for a little more diversity in the movie\\'s subjects. Aren\\'t there any boring, conventionally innocent kids marching in God\\'s army?You don\\'t have to be extreme or liberal to be shaken by Jesus Camp.As a documentary, Jesus Camp could lose its haunted-house score and contrapuntal Air America refrains and still deliver its message...It stares into the face of faith run amok, and for those willing to follow its gaze, it provides sad revelations. We haven\\'t got space to do justice to David Zeiger\\'s important historical documentary Sir! No Sir! but suffice it to say that it will change your understanding of the Vietnam era, even if you were alive then.I expected to emerge depressed by how long these stories have gone untold, but the speakers\\' courage and humanity are a shot in the arm.Zeiger\\'s movie is a timely salute to the risky and brave men and women who had the temerity not only to think for themselves but to speak their minds.Shines a light on a forgotten corner of the antiwar movement: the men (and a few women) who returned from their tours of duty filled with doubt and disillusionment over what they saw, and did, there.About an almost-forgotten fact of the Vietnam era: Anti-war sentiment among U.S. troops grew into a problem for the Pentagon.Honors those who fought, then questioned the morality of that fight, then joined the national protest.While a great number of former servicemen are interviewed for the film, their largely one-on-one recollections and testimonies are greatly magnified by the massive amount of archival visual footage presented here.Hawks and doves alike should be grateful to Zeiger for preserving a fascinating piece of American cultural history that the vets recount here.It\\'s an invaluable record of what some soldiers felt about the war they fought and what some soldiers did about it when they returned home.Sir! No Sir! movingly captures the raw excitement of grunts discovering their power and their voices in their ability to resist.A powerful documentary that uncovers half-forgotten history, history that is still relevant but not in ways you might be expecting.... an unexpected gem ...This is powerful stuff, offering us not only a new look at the past, but to the unavoidably relevant insights into the present.In his smart, timely documentary, David Zeiger remembers that war and the veterans whose struggles against it are too often forgotten.Sir! No Sir! so vividly evokes the rage, passion and provocation of the era it chronicles that it feels up-to-the-minute.If there was such a widespread antiwar movement within the military, why did the war drag on so long?As it is, this one is compelling enough, a potent mix of outrage, residual anger, and sorrow that speaks not just to the legacy of our misadventures in Vietnam, but to the entire uncertain future of a nation at war.This is an important chapter in the Vietnam library of films.The voices of the veterans alone, however, make this an important and poignant film that can speak to any generation.This compelling documentary by director David Zeiger recounts what were more than half a million \\'incidents of desertion\\' during the war, many of them acts of direct rebellion against the legitimacy of the war. This muckraking documentary on America\\'s personal-debt crisis lays bare the predatory practices of credit card companies and the Bush administration\\'s cozy relationship with the financial services industry.Do not see this film if you worry about money.Maxed Out focuses on how much we\\'re in hock without ever really wondering why we need to buy.This scattershot expos?? of usurious banking practices examines why the most vulnerable segment of society is victimized by the lending industry and finds a simple answer: It\\'s obscenely profitable.Maxed Out exposes the credit card sham for what it is, and fingers the hustlers who perpetuate it.To maximize your return on this useful report, sit through the end credits where Spurlock deposits some of his best material.Maxed Out doesn\\'t really offer solutions, probably because there are none. But it does a great job of showing how the rich get richer and the poor foot the bill, plus interest.Maxed Out, while occasionally muddled in its financial details, presents a more-accurate-than-not vision of a nation that is starting to look like a candidate for rehab, on both an individual and a national level, for its addiction to debt.The film\\'s scattered ruminations on credit card mania add up to a powerful indictment of a culture of mindless consumption spinning out of control.Though the movie sometimes feels a bit cursory in telling its many stories, many of its points resonate strongly, in that hey-how-come-I-didn\\'t-know-that way that the best muckraking journalism can do.While the documentary does a credible job of pointing out the magnitude of the problem, it skirts the issue of what can be done about it and by whom.All the film provides is this bulletin: Lefties are angry about the things Lefties are angry about, chiefly corporate profits.James Scurlock\\'s often riveting documentary is likely to leave you outraged over the manipulative greed of America\\'s banks and credit card firms.James Scurlock\\'s documentary serves up cautionary tales of epic abuse, though the overall tone is faux cheerful and sometimes genuinely entertaining, especially in the use of clips from an old educational film that looks too fatuous to be faux.Scurlock\\'s filmmaking style leans more heavily on woebegone personal testimony than facts and figures, but politicians willing to go up against the credit industry\\'s lobbyists would be well advised to take a look.Scurlock does well to counter the more dire aspects of the film with a razor-sharp sense of humor.A film all high school seniors should see. And their parents. And their siblings, neighbors, best friends and acquaintances. You should see it, too.James Scurlock\\'s Maxed Out takes a long-overdue swipe at the shamelessly predatory tactics of the credit-card and home-mortgage industries, which are feeding on the most economically vulnerable members of our society.A slapdash piece of work totally indebted to second-hand rhetorical strategies (the \\'50s educational film, glib Bush-bashing) and threadbare indignation.Given that James D. Scurlock\\'s documentary Maxed Out is a resolutely uncinematic progression of talking heads -- and they\\'re talking about a subject most of us would rather not even think about -- it\\'s a remarkably entertaining film. []The voices of these brave young people reverberate hauntingly.Mostly a string of talking-head interviews, but those talking heads -- more than 16 men and women -- are compelling.It\\'s a haunting and welcome addition to the growing library of war documentaries; one that wisely lets its subjects speak for themselves.The Ground Truth powerfully documents the human cost of the Iraq war.It\\'s an edifying, upsetting film that offers a different perspective on the situation in the Middle East.Those vets certainly deserve to be heard, but virtually every scene of the film tells us something we already knew.This thoughtful, sensitive film, perhaps the most emotionally wrenching of all the Iraq documentaries, could have been made after any war.I don\\'t pretend to understand the pressures facing U.S. troops in Iraq, but I feel a little closer after witnessing The Ground Truth.Films like Top Gun and newscasts of 9/11 motivated some Americans to enlist. Thoughtful documentaries like The Ground Truth urge the rest of us to shoulder the consequences.The documentary any American with an opinion on our involvement in Iraq owes it to his or her conscience to see.Among the many virtues of Patricia Foulkrod\\'s immensely moving documentary about veterans of the Iraq war is the measure it takes of how far we have come since Vietnam in sympathy for American soldiers who serve abroad.Even if you endorse the director\\'s bullish peacenik stance, you may feel like picking an argument, for the unique thrill that only ambiguity can deliver.Amid the continuing deluge of documentaries about the war in Iraq, Patricia Foulkrod\\'s film The Ground Truth stands out as an especially pointed indictment of the American military\\'s treatment of its own people on and off the battlefield.Thanks largely to the brutal honesty of its subjects, The Ground Truth transcends the protest genre and delivers a much broader cautionary tale.Patricia Foulkrod\\'s film backs itself into a Support Our Troops corner, elegizing the soldiers. Iraqis do not figure in, except as bad memories.A vital reminder of the monumental, lingering toll war takes on its participants.Patricia Foulkrod\\'s documentary is barely a work of art, visually unseemly and struggling for a significant throughline, but as a polemic it has the urgency of stray sniper fire.The substance of the movie is potent, and so powerfully presented by those who have fought and are still fighting a controversial war, that the message of Ground Truth cannot be dismissed.A stunning statement on how we mistreat our best and bravest young men. Most of the students had suffered or witnessed horrific abuses and crimes under the Taliban, yet the film shows two fatuous U.S. instructors who clearly missed the sensitivity training.a spiny, puzzling and highly entertaining film, and whatever you go into it thinking, you\\'re likely to come out thinking something else.Any film that raises this many interesting questions is worth seeing, though Beauty Academy never goes quite deep enough to become essential.This movie shows us a small bit of daily life as lived by real people. For that alone, we should be grateful.Yes, (Mid)west is (Mid)west and (Mid)east is (Mid)east, but the twain do meet -- sort of -- in this fascinating, unassuming little film.It\\'s a demonstration of the ancient proverb: Give a man a fish and you have fed him for today, but teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime.Without editorializing, Mermin raises fascinating questions about the cultural impact of globalization, the allure of the West, and the troubled history of an ancient land.Director Liz Mermin subtly captures both sides of a cultural divide.Audiences will come away having had an authentic encounter with the plight, the hope and the humanity of the women of Afghanistan, and that\\'s more than audiences will ever get just watching the news.An example of fascinating material that frequently triumphs over its pedestrian presentation.Surprisingly, The Beauty Academy of Kabul provides equal insight into both cultures, showing how excessive, self-obsessed disconnect can shape a culture as strongly as a hideously intruding reality.Mermin is quite skilled at separating the honorable intent of the school from dopey assumptions of several American beauticians.... a documentary whose superficial image belies its profound impact.There\\'s great charm, and also discomfort, in watching these highly motivated, excited women learn the tricks of a trade practiced very differently from their own, and casually swap horror stories of life under the Taliban.This quirky documentary about a group of American hairdressers who establish exactly that shows that the power of hair salons should never be underestimated.It\\'s that gulf between earnest idealism and beaten-down realism that\\'s the unexpected drama of Beauty Academy.Democracy might not really come from a bottle of shampoo, but Beauty Academy teaches us that, sometimes, mascara really matters.The film\\'s unforgettable stars are the beauty academy\\'s students, women who have survived tribal warfare, Soviet invasion, Muslim tyranny, American bombs, patriarchal families and even Western good intentions with extraordinary grace and fortitude.[Director Liz Mermin\\'s] focus is sometimes too narrow, as she never touches on the political or social difficulties Beauty Without Borders faces, and she leaves many questions unanswered. But her heart is in the right place, and so is the film\\'s.Mermin\\'s straightforward, no-frills account of how a group of American hair stylists taught their craft to Afghan women recently emerging from Taliban rule is admirably solicitous toward both teachers and students. A movie that is at once eye-opening and hilarious.a head-spinning mystery, a brisk history of motion picture censorship in the U.S. and entertaining, often hilarious, visual proof of Hollywood\\'s hypocrisy in his latest film.It makes a good case for some all-American free enterprise to come up with an alternative....A ringing indictment of a system that\\'s not just broken. It\\'s rigged and needs replacing.You can tell that Dick, whose previous documentary Derrida showed that he had serious chops, is having fun with this one. And a good part of the fun involves providing entertaining educational highlights for the public.Winds up feeling shallow, padded and unrevealing.Like it or not, the MPAA ratings is a system in which we all participate -- which makes this film important to see if anything is ever going to change.Although a couple of the film\\'s conclusions are as arbitrary and questionable as decisions by the board, This Film Is Not Yet Rated should be an eye-opener.This Film Is Not Yet Rated may be a mischievous, slanted and even angry piece of work, but it articulates a rage that filmmakers and film consumers have felt for years.Persuasively argues that the board is ineffective and crippled by conflicts of interest.For a film with this much argument in it, This Film is remarkably entertaining.Extremely amusing and as close a look as you\\'re likely to get at the mysterious workings of this self-appointed regulatory agency.Thumbing one\\'s nose at prudes can be fun, but it can also be childish and ultimately patronizing.While This Film Is Not Yet Rated may not present the most effective or airtight case against the MPAA, what it does dig up is damning enough.Dick doesn\\'t exactly blow the lid off the organization, but he lifts it enough to see what an outrageously flawed outfit we\\'re dealing with.At its best, This Film Is Not Yet Rated, Kirby Dick\\'s hugely entertaining catalog of MPAA follies, inventories the inconsistencies of the institution that has rated films for 40 years.It\\'s fun for a while. Then you realize all this Michael Moore-ish folderol is weakening the movie\\'s strongest arguments.The same story in print would move more fleetly and makes its points more adroitly.... a jazzy jeremiad that dances around the whole dilemma of ratings.A flawed but also very funny and very welcome attack on the motion picture ratings board. There must be better, more useful ways of amusing themselves but obviously none which would allow them to strut the stage to the plaudits of a baying crowd like latter-day rock stars.Very funny.Like most guitar solos, the film doesn\\'t quite know when to quit.Despite the film\\'s admirable brevity it\\'s still hard to maintain a wry ironic grin for a full 81 minutes.Shot in a raw, grungy style that lends the film a degree of authenticity, AGN is a riff-roaring experience that rarely hits a bum note.A nuts-and-bolts document of the annual Air Guitar World Championships which take place in the rural outpost of Oulu in Finland.A delightfully surreal look at a bizarre performance art.[]A genuinely funny and absorbing documentary.Sure, there is an infectious goofiness in watching a grown man in a red robe and Hello Kitty breastplate rock out on an imaginary ax. But the gag is spread pretty thin.The film\\'s action footage -- lots of men and women thrashing around with a theoretical Fender in hand -- gets pretty tedious after a while. There is only so much self-inflicted embarrassment one can bear watching.In this pitch-perfect documentary about the very real rise of air guitar competition in the United States, and two of its top performers, stony thoughts will arise as to whether one is suddenly trapped inside a satire that got wrapped in a reality.It\\'s a limited movie, from the musical palette the performers choose, to the number of players the movie spends time with.The suggestion is that C-Diddy can be seen as a sort of ambassador for the \\'make air, not war\\' sentiment. Why not? Even as real ambassadors go, we could do worse.The film is a lovingly hilarious portrait of a bizarre and endearing pastime.[A] jolly, oddly compelling and genuinely suspenseful documentary.A favorite on the film festival circuit, Alexandra Lipsitz\\'s exuberantly funny documentary follows the triumphant path of an American air guitarist as he rises from U.S. East Coast champ to the top rankings of the international air guitar festival.It\\'s one of the charms of Air Guitar Nation that much of it plays like a mockumentary in which you\\'re not quite sure who\\'s pulling your leg. But it\\'s real, even if the guitars are not.Director Alexandra Lipsitz doesn\\'t do much more than chronicle the noise, but it\\'s intermittently fun stuff.It\\'s hard not to grin and admit that, yes, this is almost an art form. While the film is quick to posit fair trade as a solution, it fails to answer why, even with Meskela\\'s admirable initiatives, his coffee farmers still struggle to buy shoes.If you don\\'t buy Fair Trade coffee after this you never will.True, fair trade coffee is not the newest story around, but Black Gold still makes for arresting viewing.While it may prompt some to think again next time they\\'re in Starbucks, this astute insight into the coffee business is better at lauding the good guys than taking the multinationals to task for the iniquities of the global economy.If that $2 cup of Starbucks didn\\'t jolt you awake, this documentary by Marc and Nick Francis might do the trick.Black Gold moves at an inexorable pace, painstakingly building a case until suddenly it looms very large and casts an even longer shadow.... a by turns poetic and hard-hitting critique of the global coffee industry ...The lesson is clear: The system is broken and needs repair, and educating consumers is part of the solution.More dynamism and knowledge in the telling and fewer cheap shots at young Starbucks workers in Seattle wouldn\\'t have gone amiss.This is a documentary that gets a lot across while avoiding cliches and easy exploitation, even in famine-ravaged places where more horrific images must have abounded.Guaranteed to make you think twice about what you\\'re paying for what you\\'re drinking.Although some scenes register with strong impact, there also seems to be a lot of padding, and the overall narrative is ultimately too diffused and unfocused for the film to have the sociological impact it so obviously desires.Black Gold is more an Al Gore-style message of hope than a total downer.A mesmerizing documentary illuminating the human element in one corner of modern global trade.A dry but enlightening documentary.Meskela\\'s is a story worth tackling again -- but without the over-caffeinated approach.Compared to a documentary like Darwin\\'s Nightmare, which found disturbing visual analogues for the moral rot of global trade, Black Gold makes most of its points in words, not pictures.A beautifully made, provocative and very righteous documentary.The documentary Black Gold tells an unresolved modern version of the age-old David and Goliath story.No mere Western-guilt-inducing harangue, this highly informative documentary by British brothers Marc and Nick Francis is a model of patient storytelling. []The result is a persuasive movie which proves beyond doubt that at least some geniuses are intensely practical as well as intuitive.While Pollack continually favours celebrity gush over objective analysis, the shots of Gehry\\'s buildings - the Guggenheim in Bilbao being the centrepiece - and his stunning use of light do make a case for him as a genuine visionary.What\\'s missing is a critical edge.an intelligent piece of partisan adoration - although he gives some space to Gehry\\'s detractors, too.Ultimately the picture is as revealing about the director as it is about the subject. But it won\\'t appeal to those who like their documentaries to come armed with teeth.A fond and always accessible portrait, but the lack of objectivity and drooling images of Gehry\\'s work deprives this documentary of any objectivity.More a thumbnail than a full portrait.Pollack\\'s documentary is a friendly affair that presents some stunning footage of several Gehry projects.The film has lovely moments -- Gehry buildings can be extremely photogenic, after all -- but it doesn\\'t sink its teeth in the way it probably should.A refreshingly small-scale film, almost a home movie made by the director of such films as Tootsie, Out of Africa and The Way We Were.Not just instructive, but reassuring for anyone who does creative work, and who worries, as everyone does, about being equal to the task.As fascinating and faceted as its subject.What the filmmaker omits are precisely the laymen the movie set out to explain Gehry to.What benefits the picture early on, giving it a casual air, becomes cloying in the later going, making it feel like a smug exercise in mutual admiration.It is a few meaningful glimpses into the mind and life of a man who resists being seen as complex and singular.I think every time Gehry comes into a city and adds his signature, it just makes the people in the city proud of it.If Sketches of Frank Gehry fails to reconcile these extroverted buildings with their apparently introverted maker, it offers some heartfelt appreciation.There are also a few critics brought in to provide balance, although Pollack\\'s opinion is clear: Gehry is a genius. Having gazed upon the Guggenheim and the Disney and sat happily on the grass beneath the Spider\\'s web, I think so, too.In its own relaxed, meandering way it offers valuable insights into how a major artist thinks and works. Packed with observations and recrimations, many of the latter aimed at or by Chinaglia, which makes for some gossipy entertainment.... treats its audience like a bunch of attention deficit disorder cases.... accomplishes the minor miracle of making you mourn a sports team you likely never knew existed in the first place.Once in a Lifetime, which relies on interviews and archival footage, may not be a great documentary, but it certainly gets its points across.Once in a Lifetime would have benefited greatly from historical and outside perspective, but the story on screen is such a kick that even monotone narrator Matt Dillon gets caught up in the excitement.An energetic and often enjoyable documentary, particularly for soccer fans.Once in a Lifetime does a wonderful job of showing that this collection of foreigners playing a foreign sport forged one of the great American sports stories.The movie is only so-so, borrowing a little from the VH-1 school of popumentary but lacking the snazzy production values.Lively, free-wheeling amusement.Far more entertaining than it has a right to be.Anyone who wants to relive this flamboyant but fleeting chapter in America\\'s uneven soccer history should not miss this.You don\\'t need to be a soccer fan to, like Cosmos fans, fall for this captivating tale, told in Rashomon-like style.The documentary offers enough color and depth to hold your interest and leave you keen to see the World Cup finals.No Hollywood scriptwriter would dare make up a tale as outrageously unlikely -- but, as it happens, true -- as the one so entertainingly told in the documentary Once in a Lifetime: The Extraordinary Story of the New York Cosmos.Once in a Lifetime performs a belated autopsy on the Cosmos and the North American Soccer League and basically concludes that they died of impatience.Told in a breezy, fast-cut style, and backed by a boisterous soundtrack that ranges from Puccini to James Brown, Lifetime focuses on the players -- on the field and off -- that made the Cosmos such a super, if short-lived, team.Giddy, gossipy and endearingly unslick, Once in a Lifetime chronicles the rise and fall of the most famous soccer team in the United States with slapdash glee.If nothing else, the energetic documentary Once In A Lifetime proves that an audience once existed for soccer in this country, and could be cultivated again.This intermittently fascinating documentary chronicles the rise and fall of the Cosmos--which is also the rise and fall of U.S. soccer....a stylish scramble of evocative footage, groovy music, and crazy-candid reminiscences from key players still proud to score. []Ultimately, Why We Fight reveals itself as yet another leftie doc with an anti-war agenda. But the mere fact that it takes time to ask questions and listen to opposing viewpoints sets it apart from the pack.A film that stands out for its passion, ambition and clarion-call sincerity, even amid the contemporary onslaught of political documentaries.Extremely timely and urgently relevant.The fact is, Jon Stewart on The Daily Show uncovers this same hypocrisy every night, and does it in two minutes with irony and humor, while Why We Fight attempts it with outrage and scolding.... canny and somewhat overwhelming documentary ...Eugene Jarecki\\'s Why We Fight takes on enough subjects to make five great documentaries, but as a result is so scattered that it doesn\\'t quite make for one good one.It\\'s impossible to imagine anyone, right-leaning or left, coming away from this hugely important documentary unshaken by its representation of the United States and its military establishment.More leftist propaganda masquerading as documentary.Fluidly edited by Nancy Kennedy, Why We Fight interweaves these personal stories not only with history but with one another, yielding some choice ironies.The strength of this documentary lies in its balance, or at least the careful appearance of balance. Both sides of the issue receive their due ...Jarecki\\'s thoughtful, nonconfrontational approach makes it absorbing viewing, regardless of whether or not you buy his arguments.Jarecki seems to have had his answers before asking the questions. He\\'s a master at filtering, at choosing the best quotes to bolster his argument and at connecting dots that, perhaps, shouldn\\'t be.After Ike makes his point in the opening minutes, the film itself essentially just elaborates it.Why We Fight has passion and ambition and research to spare. Too bad Jarecki didn\\'t take a somewhat fresher, more balanced approach in making his case.There is plenty here that should worry members of both political parties.Even if one disagrees vehemently with Jarecki\\'s interpretations of events and history, it\\'s hard not to be impressed by the rigorousness with which he gathers his arguments.A somber polemic that presents a convincing case against using war as an economic booster -- although, Jarecki argues, that is precisely what the United States has been doing under every president since Truman.Memo to left-wing anti-Bushies: Stories like this work. Don\\'t lecture. Tell stories! Much better!The film is a clear-headed anomaly of reason that one hopes won\\'t get lost in the bicker-and-scream shuffle of TV punditry. If anything this film proves that song can have more impact than a little toe tapping and tub-thumping.What promises to be a provocative account of the late Beatle\\'s involvement with the American underground delivers precious little in this Yoko-approved documentary.By the time The U.S. vs. John Lennon is done, the filmmakers have reinforced the sense that pop music once produced prophets, as well as profits.Lennon\\'s spirit, like his music, shines through this movie like a beacon.The film paints with swaggeringly broad strokes, the basic thesis being Lennon = good, government = bad.Humanizing Lennon to those who might find the man a bit inaccessible, and adding the word \\'courage\\' to his long list of positive attributes.A refresher course in the perils of celebrity and activism, but its syllabus and insights are purely remedial.Documentarians David Leaf and John Scheinfeld go beyond the usual glibness, revealing a much fuller portrait of the man.Though Lennon\\'s commitment to a peaceful world is vivid and unquestionable, The U.S. vs. John Lennon ultimately emerges as a picture of a different kind of commitment: a love story.Concentrates on Lennon\\'s post-Beatles years, in which he did a lot of great work that\\'s overlooked today, and it\\'s good to have a lot shown on that period.The film\\'s first half has zero to do with its title, and its second half digs up familiar turf.The aim may be laudable, but nothing gets hit except some awfully tired targets. And fatigue doesn\\'t resonate.Entertaining, and a history lesson in hysteria (both on the side of Nixon and the protest movement) for people who were not there.Probably should be seen as an addendum to a much larger story of turmoil in the U.S., but it does have something that elevates a now-familiar story of protest and dissent: plenty of footage of Lennon and lots of Lennon\\'s music.Works by reminding us of Lennon\\'s best qualities: His impish, imperturbable sense of humor, his quick intelligence, his successful bantering with a hostile crush of world press mercenaries.It\\'s great to see a lot of this footage of Lennon -- playful, engaged, warm and spontaneous.His life has been raked over by so many books, movies, magazine articles, and TV shows that The U.S. vs. John Lennon barely justifies its own existence.The documentary\\'s a hagiography, no mistake about it, but a fascinating one all the same, and it makes the case that Lennon was as much a genius provocateur as he was a cracked saint.Readers tempted to write off that episode as yet another paranoid fantasy of The Left should take heed: The U.S. vs. John Lennon includes the firsthand testimony of the spies themselves, from apostate FBI agents to the unapologetic G. Gordon Liddy.It\\'s full-up with footage that shows the hero of the Yoko Ono-sanctioned film to be as witty, entertaining and dependably charismatic as ever, and rarely as simple-minded as his detractors would have it. Gracefully weaving together interviews (some with the soldiers convicted of the beating), fresh images and official photographs, it suggests why so many politically themed fiction films have failed.[]Like the Iraq war documentary No End in Sight, this movie about the U.S. military\\'s systematic torture of terror suspects is a triumph not of reporting but of synthesis.Alex Gibney won best documentary Oscar for this gruelling, angry movie.An unflinching documentary that exposes one of the darkest chapters in American history.Impossible to shake off.Certain to inspire both outrage and sorrow, Alex Gibney\\'s harrowing documentary -- about the torture and abuse of suspected terrorists in U.S. military prisons -- ranks among recent cinema\\'s more excoriating moral indictments.Taxi to the Dark Side is a stunning indictment of torture as policy, a brilliant documentary whose arguments are so well-supported and reasonably made that you can\\'t ignore them.Along with No End in Sight, this movie is one of the essential documentaries of the ongoing war.Taxi to the Dark Side joins a growing list of outspoken documentaries that question the rationale and conduct of America\\'s presence in Iraq and Afghanistan, and our willingness to destroy freedom in order to save it.The film certainly makes its case, tracing a chain of abuse from Bagram to the notorious Iraqi prison, Abu Ghraib, to the cells of Guantanamo.Taxi to the Dark Side may not be your idea of a fun, relaxing night at the movies, but it is artful moviemaking and vital viewing for anyone interested in the issues.So disturbing, on so many levels, that it\\'s hard to know where to begin.One of the most powerful, carefully researched investigations of the moral-legal side effects of current American military campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq.Will go down in film history as a damning historical document of the Bush administration\\'s wartime expansion of executive powers.Exhaustively researched and shattering documentary by Alex Gibney.Horrifying.The most extraordinary thing about the grim Best Documentary Academy Award nominee Taxi to the Dark Side is how straightforward its interviewees are about the military prisoner they collectively murdered in Afghanistan in 2002.Taxi to the Dark Side adds something new to our awareness -- interviews with soldiers who served as interrogators in Afghanistan, and in Iraq\\'s notorious Abu Ghraib prison, and who, in some cases, served prison terms themselves.By the time it\\'s over, [director Gibney has] broadened his focus into a documentary so damning of the U.S. government, it\\'s hard to believe he even got it made. [][]You could hardly call it a paragon of impartial filmmaking, but this is still a compelling and immersive glance into the nature of competitiveness and the corrupting aspects of fame.An engrossing story that plucks at the heartstrings just as hard as it pummels the fire buttons.Benefits immeasurably from a cast of colorful supporting players, as well as a taut narrative that builds to a surprisingly tense climax.Is there anything more tiresome than watching people play video games? Seth Gordon\\'s documentary The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters answers that question with a decisive yes: watching a movie about people playing video games.The King of Kong is as winning, sweet, and occasionally disturbing a documentary about people for whom time has stopped somewhere around 1982 as you\\'d ever want to see.A terrifically entertaining documentary about an unlikely subject.Hilarious and eye-popping.Wonderful, hilarious documentary.Directed by Seth Gordon, the film illuminates and draws you into a subculture you never knew existed and makes you genuinely care about its characters.Nerds rule.The big laughs here come from the subjects\\' self-absorption.With the results up in the air until the very end of the film, you will care who wins the goofy contest.A classic video-arcade game becomes the means of an epic struggle in this funny, surprisingly poignant video documentary.A gripping yarn, an edge-of-your-seat thriller, as well as a mocking insider\\'s view and a genuine giggle.It\\'s almost embarrassing how compelling this film becomes...One of the most fascinating films of the year, and it deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary.A documentary that is beyond strange.A pretty great trip down memory lane, even if you were one of the cool kids who managed to avoid the arcade scene. [][]Progressive clergy provide enough historical context to neutralize the handful of Bible verses prohibiting homosexual acts, but Karslake never confronts the broader issues of sexuality and procreation that bedevil even moderate Christians.This is a compelling, thought-provoking portrait of a quiet challenge rising within America\\'s churches.If imperfect, the film is also necessary.For the Bible Tells Me So is a great documentary and an even better motion picture, and as a testament to faith and family I can\\'t imagine a finer example than this.Daniel Karslake\\'s remarkable documentary boldly takes on a loaded topic -- Christianity and homosexuality -- and examines it both intellectually and emotionally; the result may well leave you blinking away a few tears.A brisk, entertaining and even moving exploration of the sometimes frayed intersection where Christianity meets homosexuality.Its main surprise is the compassion shown toward everyone, on all sides of the debate. It does not vilify those who vilify gays.While the film is unlikely to sway anyone whose mind already isn\\'t made up, it provides plenty food for thought in its examination of biblical doctrine on same-sex love and how it resonates to this day.The film will probably end up preaching to the converted, albeit in an engaging and surprisingly light-hearted fashion.For the Bible Tells Me So doesn\\'t follow the formula. That\\'s just one of the reasons it works well as a film and a lesson about, as one open-minded preacher puts it, what the Bible \"reads\" about what it supposedly \"says\" about homosexuality.If you can look beyond the polemics, this is also a powerful story about the emotional pain and psychological trauma that splits families and breaks hearts.[Director] Karslake balances the more emotional elements of the film together with the scriptural analysis and weaves them into a moving conclusion.For the Bible Tells Me So probes the conflict between an obdurate force and a movable object, hoping against hope and the laws of physics that one can sway the other.Here\\'s hoping Karslake\\'s film won\\'t simply preach to the converted.There is no denying that the film fills a need. The inevitable DVD should be packaged in a plain cardboard sleeve, so that viewers can carry it in their pockets and, if confronted by a homophobe, hand it over and say, \"Watch this, then get back to me.\"This rational, human and very serious documentary by Daniel Karslake gets at the historical distortions of the Good Book as well as the ease with which holy writings have been used in America to propagate hate.As long as it\\'s dissecting the six or seven passages in the Bible that ostensibly disparage homosexuality, this documentary ode to tolerance takes a shrewd look at how speciously selective and ahistorical the church condemnation of gays really is.More human interest than agitprop. [][][]The fallout decades later provides the drama in this documentary by Doug Pray, who lets his eccentric octogenarian subject off a little too easy.A provocative documentary about a man who dropped out to follow a dream that gradually evolved into something not unlike a nightmare.Not just the story of one man\\'s obsessive quest to find harmony on a plank of wood, Surfwise offers a cautionary tale about parenting, homeschooling (camper-schooling, actually), sibling rivalries and family sacrifice.The film\\'s director, Doug Pray, has been able to track down each and every Paskowitz child, and he weaves their memories together with old home movies, still photos and news clippings to create an evocative portrait of their lives.Some documentarians think like essayists, propagandists, abstract painters, or magazine reporters. Doug Pray approaches his documentaries as though he\\'s writing books.The unorthodox upbringing of the Paskowitz clan is the subject of Surfwise, the story of a family who lived on the road, camped at the beachfront and fashioned its own vanguard version of 1960s-\\'70s alternative lifestyles.There are too many unanswered questions and a suspicious forced happy ending, but Surfwise is still a fascinatingly voyeuristic and emotionally powerful movie.Having previously dug into Seattle grunge (1996\\'s Hype!) and hip-hop scratch (2001\\'s Scratch), filmmaker Pray continues his subculture-immersion studies in this revealing portrait of Dorian \\'Doc\\' Paskowitz.It\\'s a complex and conflicted look at a family, torn apart by rifts and yet still bonded by love.An honest look at a complicated human situation,... it turns out to be a darker film than might be expected.The movie feels exhaustive in its loaded 90-something minutes, showing and telling us much while leaving the meaning of the tangles and twists in this family open to interpretation. For once, the tip of the iceberg is enough.A mesmerizingly ambivalent documentary about an itinerant family of Jewish surfer-dude health nuts.Surfwise has a bohemian vibe and a cool sheen, but it\\'s an eager-to-please, pleasing commercial enterprise with a reassuring narrative arc.What kid wouldn\\'t want to spend every day at the beach instead of in school? Well, Doug Pray\\'s absorbing new documentary suggests that no dream is as ideal as it may seem.Surfwise tries to separate itself from the fray of political documentaries by not taking itself too seriously. Charles Ferguson\\'s gripping No End in Sight relies on former Bush administration officials to make the case that in its earliest stages the American military operation in Iraq was catastrophically mismanaged.[][]A thorough, level-headed examination of the Bush administration\\'s failure to properly prepare for, and execute, the war.Lucidly, dramatically and without resorting to partisan rhetoric, Charles Ferguson\\'s not-to-be-missed documentary \"No End in Sight\" lays out in convincing, appalling detail the disastrous missteps of the U.S. occupation of Iraq.A tidy summary of the tragic mistakes made, and the brutal arrogance displayed, by the Bush administration in its prosecution of the Iraq war.This is a movie about the very officials who boasted \\'I don\\'t do quagmires\\' (then-defense secretary Rumsfeld), but who hadn\\'t actually done the planning or simple reading of other people\\'s plans that might have avoided that very fate.A clear-eyed appraisal and condemnation of Bush administration war policies as seen through the eyes of people in a position to note the disastrous choices that left a country in chaos.Narrated with a detached, grim authority by Campbell Scott, Ferguson\\'s film is surely the most nonhistrionic cinematic explanation of our current geopolitical woes yet seen.No End in Sight makes one thing clear: Were it not so bloody, the war in Iraq would be destined to become a case study in the nation\\'s business schools.Ferguson\\'s case is so confidently built that it seems unassailable...Its list of interviewees includes a number of insiders once deeply involved in the bungled aftermath of America\\'s invasion of Iraq. It also includes some shocking, on-the-ground footage from the war that has not been seen elsewhere.No End in Sight is the most coolheaded of the Iraq war documentaries, the most methodical and the least polemical. Yet it\\'s the one that will leave audiences the most shattered, angry and astounded.No End in Sight will leave you floored, agape and enraged anew.Ferguson is admirably tenacious in assigning blame for the boneheaded mistakes that have doomed Iraqi reconstruction.A raft of documentaries have come along since the start of the war, some of them accusatory, some investigative, some empathetic, nearly all of them skeptical. None is better argued or more searing than No End in Sight.Remember the scene in A Clockwork Orange where Alex has his eyes clamped open and is forced to watch a movie? I imagine a similar experience for the architects of our catastrophe in Iraq. I would like them to see No End in Sight.Lucid, concise and devastating.[No End in Sight] may be the best and saddest film of the year so far.No End in Sight, the latest Iraq documentary, is the first to attempt a detailed historical overview and probably the only one with the potential to reach across partisan lines, a true rarity in the sphere of political filmmaking. []...he\\'s far more candid recalling his grand delusions in a school play than he is when he gets to Broadway and Hollywood....it\\'s a funny and frequently affecting reminiscence...Life of Reilly is vivid proof that living well, and laughing heartily, can be the best revenge.As this entertaining recording of his one-man show reveals, Reilly was a natural raconteur.The Life of Reilly lets us know how much the world has changed.Director Barry Poltermann\\'s sweet little evocation of a show business career captures Reilly at \\'the twilight of an extraordinary life,\\' in Reilly\\'s words.There\\'s a genuine wonderment and breathless joy in Reilly\\'s delivery that hints at what a fine stage actor he must have been, particularly when he describes going to a movie for the first time, or his thrill at first getting the lead in the school play.It\\'s fortunate that we have this filmed record -- directed by Barry Poltermann and Frank Anderson -- of a memorable solo performance by a true show business original.The Life of Reilly is a tender tale of semi-triumph.In this rippingly entertaining documentary of Reilly\\'s celebrated autobiographical monologue Save It for the Stage, the unfailingly witty, shamelessly bitchy Reilly gets to set the record straight about a number of things.The Life of Reilly pays fitting homage to a man who deserves to be remembered for much more than just trading double-entendres with Brett Somers on The Match Game.[Reilly] looks frail but holds the audience spellbound in Barry Poltermann and Frank Anderson\\'s valuable record of the final performance of the autobiographical show that he toured for five years.One could say there are two kinds of people: those who appreciate Charles Nelson Reilly, and those who don\\'t know enough about him. This engaging documentary will charm the former and educate the latter.This charming, bittersweet 90-minute monologue consists of the actor telling tales of his childhood and early years, when he was an ugly duckling from an uglier family.Written by Reilly and Paul Linke, the film is both revealing and evasive. You want to know more about his personal life than you ever find out.Save It for the Stage, a one-man stage show by Charles Nelson Reilly, a showbiz gadfly and Tony Award-winning theater director.Even abridged, The Life Of Reilly is spellbinding.An exuberant story it is, at least as digested and heightened in this truncated performance, filmed before an audience at the end of the show\\'s L.A. engagement.Occasionally you see a documentary and it hits you how much you don\\'t know about someone who was part of your mental landscape. Charles Nelson Reilly didn\\'t arouse much of anything in me, but he does in The Life of Reilly. This is the essential ill that Sicko addresses, in an eruption that\\'s the most unruly and uncategorizable part of the whole movie, and the most unmistakably heartfelt. You want the truth? Moore can handle the truth.Sicko is wildly comic while tearing apart the country\\'s health care system.There\\'s plenty of grandstanding, most of it very funny. And in this instance, all that sizzle is selling the steak.If other countries can provide their people with universal health care, why can\\'t we? If we can\\'t, who are we?Moore has again made a film which, though basically sound in logic, sugars the pill in a way which seems suspect in its determination to suggest that, as far as healthcare is concerned, America is bad and everywhere else is good.A devastating exposure of America\\'s iniquitous healthcare system, coolly marshalled and amusingly detailed by Moore.Moore is rightly celebrated for his elaborately staged stunts and this film\\'s highlight, involving a boat-trip to Cuba, is as hilarious as it is disturbing.If Moore were a more radical polemicist, he might have focused squarely on this alarming social injustice, but, perhaps rightly, he sees a broader one. Even the insured are handing themselves over to a bewildering lottery.Mr Moore\\'s excellent new film is a wakeup call.While we all have our grumbles about the NHS, it\\'s hard not to be caught up in Moore\\'s righteous indignation on behalf of his countrymen, or not to feel a twitch of pride in our own.Horrifying, heart-breaking, often hilarious - Moore\\'s latest shock doc is a potent polemic.Moore\\'s commentary can grate, but his most brilliant prank - escorting a group of 911 workers to Cuba for free healthcare - manages to be political gelignite and intensely moving at the same time.Though the focus occasionally strays, the film emerges as a fascinating exploration and powerful indictment of a pressing national problem. This is Moore\\'s biggest, best and most impassioned work.Metaphorically speaking, it goes straight for the jugular.\\'Sicko\\' is a quieter, more focused and less feral beast than its predecessor, \\'Fahrenheit 9/11\\', but that\\'s not saying much.One may quibble with Mr. Moore\\'s anecdotal oversimplifications and his xenophilic fantasies, but he has struck a socio-psychic nerve in the body politic, generating a feeling of outrage that seems to be reverberating in every theater.This is a movie to see in a theater. It\\'a group experience. All through the show you\\'ll hear people laughing, crying, muttering, cheering, sighing, swearing, and gasping. And at the end, chances are they\\'ll be on their feet applauding.In moving away from the dirty arena of polemics, Sicko accomplishes something Moore has sought for quite some time: coherence.Sicko is worth seeing -- as long as the big grain of salt needed for it is put on more than just the popcorn.Even Moore\\'s worst ideological enemies would be hard put to dispute the basic argument of his new film Sicko: The American health-care system is a sick joke and has been for a very long time. [][][]The crowd-pleaser has enough ambition to pitch a one-size-fits-all philosophy based on the Apollo crew\\'s revelation that looking down from space, our problems seem trivial.Respectful, enthusiastic and occasionally rather touching as the men, now in their seventies, recall how it felt up there. Yet the really important question never gets asked: what was it all for?The shots of the Moon, even after so many effects-heavy studio films have tried to recreate the look, are uncanny.Stirring stuff, packed with as many beautiful images as portentous outbursts.There is something thrilling and moving in this documentary about the great era of the Nasa moon landings.You probably won\\'t find a more comprehensive document of space exploration on film.The heart of Sington\\'s film is the dry humour and boundless humility of his interviewees.David Sington more than makes up for the straightforward nature of his film with the quality of its interviews and plenitude of staggering archive footage.This wonderful documentary succeeds as a reminder of human endeavour.The movie fills us with wonder, and pride, and a tugging sense of loss.Successfully recaptures the feeling of what made the Apollo missions so special.The astronaut interviews are fun and occasionally moving...The contrast between the near-surreal space footage and the down-to-earth men who were actually in those spacesuits is awe-inspiring.It\\'s a well-timed tribute to American initiative and courage...There\\'s vibrant visual poetry here.It certainly is fascinating.When it comes to the Apollo program, nobody relates the saga of men going to the moon quite like the corps of 24 who actually made the trip. More an abstract hallucination than a photo-realist portrait, My Winnipeg would be out of place on the \"documentary\" shelf at the video store. But it deserves prime placement in the Guy Maddin canon.Maddin mixes personal reminiscences with elaborate fantasies of Masonic rituals and collectivist brothels, to construct a vision of Winnipeg as a city of sleepwalkers.[][]Maddin is a real film-maker with a confident, fluent movie language that is evolving in fascinating directions.Guy Maddin docu about his hometown gives fans everything they\\'d expect, plus a few moments of unexpected sincerity.[]The best way to take My Winnipeg is with a box of popcorn and a grain of salt.This is a secret history, and it\\'s a wonder.Witty, moving and visually dazzling.An affecting, dreamy, Chris Marker-esque, cin??-essay.My Winnipeg is a mobile collage, and its assemblage is fascinating.The world would be a better place if every city had its Maddin.In the narration Maddin claims that Winnipeg has ten times as many sleepwalkers as any other city in the world, and though he\\'s surely making this up, it conveys his own sense of entrapment amid the town\\'s dreaminess.If you love movies in the very sinews of your imagination, you should experience the work of Guy Maddin.An unhinged, utterly delightful \\'documentary\\'.For the uninitiated, I heartily recommend this free-associative, autobiographical gem.Much of what Maddin asserts as truth is balderdash. He was not, for example, born in the locker room of the local hockey team\\'s arena.The film, shot in black and white, like most of Maddin\\'s creations, is a treat for fans and a migraine for the uninitiated or terminally dull.This haunting phantasmagoria of a film -- comic, singular, surreal -- is not only something no one but the Canadian director could have made, it\\'s also a film no one else would have even wanted to make. Which is the heart of its appeal. [][][][]This documentary about life in and around a vast scientific research centre in Antarctica. None of these meetings, however, is as interesting as the interspersed footage of the pole\\'s natural wonders.Seemingly off-hand, cumulatively imposing, utterly masterful.As a nature doc alone, Encounters at the End of the World would stand as one of the year\\'s best. But it is the people who choose to live and work at the very ends of the Earth that are Herzog\\'s real subject.It\\'s a thoroughly intelligent, worthwhile and tremendous-looking film. But where is the dark spark of Herzog magic?Almost every film Werner Herzog makes is savage and incisive. Encounters at the End of the World, far-out and unforgettable.As a nature documentary it\\'s nothing special. But that was never the intent. As an observational study of people and place, it\\'s truly fascinating.Mid-list Herzog, but still a stimulating, strange experience. And that tragically perverse penguin is the most memorable movie animal of the year.A compelling film that is by turns thought-provoking and very funny.This is Herzog in awe at life, the universe, eternity itself.Wondrous, wow-inducing marvels - seal calls that sound weirdly like Pink Floyd; rare glimpses into the eerily alien underwater universe of exquisite ice cathedrals - uplift the soul as Herzog explores his pet obsessions.The film is beautifully shot both under the ice, where creatures roam in a place that would rival any sci-fi horror.[]Herzog is one of a kind. His new doc is an event you watch in awe as you marvel at its wonders.Herzog, contemporary cinema\\'s most consistently lyrical examiner of the (in)human condition, returns to the documentary form in yet another wonderfully improbable locale: Antarctica, the literal bottom of the world.The sky is relentlessly blue, the sun bright even in the thick of night. In this odd and unforgettable place, Herzog has made his own poetry.A poem of oddness and beauty. Herzog is like no other filmmaker, and to return to him is to be welcomed into a world vastly larger and more peculiar than the one around us. The underwater photography alone would make a film, but there is so much more. []The Devil Came On Horseback sets out to shock. The images caught by Steidle\\'s camera will stay with you long after his personal story - given too much time in relation to events - has faded from memory.A decent attempt at outling the crises but crucially lacking much depth.Filmmakers Ricki Stern and Anne Sundberg chronicle his burgeoning activism in the face of the U.S. government\\'s indifference as the government of Sudan works systematically to eradicate black Africans from the region.The Devil Came on Horseback is a documentary account of Steidle\\'s ongoing efforts to educate the world about the violence he witnessed as an unarmed military observer for the African Union in 2004.The film\\'s approach suits an audience broader than the usual documentary crowd, though it\\'s worth mentioning that those pictures can really stay with you.On all counts, the co-directors of this persuasive documentary set the right tone.A dynamic, shockingly graphic story of the horrors of Darfur.With an estimated 400,000 dead since 2003, and 2.5 million Sudanese left homeless in the wake of the genocide, ignoring the story doesn\\'t seem like a humane option.The Devil Came on Horseback is a documentary about the genocide in that part of Africa, and the film\\'s strength is that it shows us the horror, rather than tells us about it. It\\'s painful to watch.An exceptionally powerful film driven by contradictory forces.Too often the movies view the problems of Africa through Western eyes, but Devil turns that weakness to a literal strength, because Steidle could do nothing in his position except take photographs.[A] searing documentary on the genocide in Darfur.But The Devil Came on Horseback has galvanized audiences at film festivals around the world precisely because it presents, in its calm, measured fashion and without much ceremony, pictures that nobody really wants to see.The persuasive documentary The Devil Came On Horseback contains dozens of photographs that testify to this tragedy, yet the apathy pierces hardest of all.The failure of world conscience haunts The Devil Came on Horseback.Sincere and purposeful, Devil has the potential to do for the situation in Darfur what An Inconvenient Truth did for global warming, which is to say, get people talking about it.Brutal, urgent, devastating -- the documentary The Devil Came on Horseback demands to be seen as soon as possible and by as many viewers as possible.Devil ponders the optimism/pessimism = apathy/x equation as honestly and studiously as any doc I\\'ve ever seen.Both explains the rationale for the chaos in Darfur in terms we can all understand and asks us to follow Steidle\\'s lead by demanding our leaders to act now in order to save the helpless people of Darfur. [][]The movie never editorializes; it simply presents. It is tragedy, not statistics.Myth and reality, past and present, tradition and progress go head to head in Yung Chang\\'s remarkable documentary about China\\'s longest river, Up the Yangtze.The tone is finally one of wistful resignation.There\\'s plenty for the director to focus on. Examining the dam\\'s environmental impact alone would take another whole movie. Instead, [director] Yung trains his lens mainly on the cultural impact.Visually stunning, this documentary by Chinese-Canadian filmmaker Yung Chang is part travelogue, part social critique of China\\'s economic miracle and the sweeping cultural changes it is forcing in its wake.Up The Yangtze goes from sleepily hypnotic to riveting over the course of 90 minutes.What Chinese Canadian filmmaker Yung Chang achieves in his documentary Up the Yangtze is remarkable.In his masterful and haunting documentary Up the Yangtze, Yung Chang shows the old China drowning helplessly under the weight of the new.In doing so he photographs a landscape and country going through profound change on an almost unimaginable scale, all of it building to a final scene that\\'s chilling in its Joseph Conrad-like uncertainty.Its range of subjects and emotions cuts a surprisingly wide swath.One of the real pluses of Up the Yangtze, aside from its empathy with its subjects, is its striking visual quality.Filmmaker Yung Chang finds a sad and beautiful way to glimpse the big picture of dislocation through an exquisitely poised small study.Yung Chang is a Canadian director whose grandparents came from China, and his witty, lovely and profoundly unsettling documentary Up the Yangtze takes him back to the legendary river of his grandfather\\'s homeland, now transformed beyond recognition.China\\'s public image suffers another blow with Up the Yangtze, a docu mentary by Chinese-Canadian Yung Chang.An astonishing documentary of culture clash and the erasure of history amid China\\'s economic miracle.Just where is China taking us besides up the Yangtze River? Mr. Yung\\'s film does not even pretend to know, and that is its great strength as it plunges more deeply into the truly unknown.Chang gracefully juxtaposes the country and the metropolitan to express the knotted-up mixture of anguish, anger, hope, and trepidation of those in the dammed river\\'s wake.Yung Chang\\'s always illuminating, often heart-rending, documentary. [][][][]The lesson here is not simply to vilify the Japanese soldiers of that era, but to make sure that we never forget who we are and what our country stands for today.Sheds light on particular wartime atrocities largely neglected in the collective memory.Nanking doesn\\'t tell us why decency and compassion completely break down from time to time. It just tells us something terribly modern and all too familiar.Anyone who sees Nanking should know going in what a brutal story it is, but no one should miss it because of a restrictive rating.Nanking does justice to this tragedy even though it makes the mistake of mixing the testimony of actual participants with staged readings from actors subbing for real people.The filmmakers employ a powerful technique of interspersing newsreel footage with wrenching on-camera interviews of survivors and sequences of actors reciting from the letters and memoirs of the Westerners on the scene.I have rarely, if ever, seen a documentary reconstruction of a historical event that is so rich in firsthand (and well-preserved) photographic material.A somberly effective look at one of the most shameful events in human history.Nanking submits yet another reminder, if any more were needed, of how wickedness in the 20th century achieved dimensions previously considered unimaginable -- or unbearable.Nanking both calls attention to a horrifying set of war crimes that remains little known in the West and crafts an impossible-but-true hymn to the power of the individual conscience.Nanking is a swift, incisive documentary about one of the lesser-known horrors of the 20th century.[A] powerful documentary.Indispensable, beautifully crafted account of a little-known Japanese massacre.The personalities it brings to light -- many of whom were forced to remain silent about what they\\'d seen after returning to their homelands -- are worthy of widespread exposure. []New York Times senior art critic Michael Kimmelman offers sharp insights when he mentions how Marla\\'s painting reflects not just \\'innocence\\' and what our psyches project into them, but also \\'the cynicism of the art world.\\'A fascinating exploration of art, creativity, and family dynamics that takes an unexpected right hook.A compelling documentary that leaves you wondering if there is nothing sacred in this stinking world.A highly engaging documentary that recounts a remarkable tale.Bar-Lev exploits Marla as much as, if not more than, any other player in his movie.My Kid Could Paint That is documentary gold, and you will have formed an opinion on the controversy by the time you leave the theater. You may not know art, but you\\'ll know what you like.More than a standard child prodigy profile, My Kid Could Paint That turns into a priceless examination of modern art, celebrity and what it means to be a kid.The self-reflexive narrative is particularly fascinating because Marla\\'s story is so critical to selling her art; everyone involved, the filmmaker included, has a vested interest in proving it genuine or fake.It\\'s a thought-provoking look at the world of abstract art, the relationship between a reporter and his/her subject, and the nature of parenting, prodigies, and \"objective\" storytelling.Documentarian Amir Bar-Lev began making a film about whether Modern art is a scam and whether a 4-year-old painter from Binghampton, N.Y., might not be as good as Picasso. But Bar-Lev ended making a film instead about whether the 4-year-old is a scam.My Kid Could Paint That is a documentary that brings to the fore questions of youth exploitation, celebrity culture, the \"con game\" that is modern art and media\\'s role in the whole tangled mess.Bar-Lev has made a refreshingly honest documentary.My Kid Could Paint That keeps us intrigued by the questions, long after its last shot of Marla.A fascinating documentary.The truth lurking beneath My Kid Could Paint That is that your kid couldn\\'t paint that.Still, this is still awful fascinating stuff at times, and little Marla Olmstead is easily one of the more singularly beguiling little kids I\\'ve seen grace the silver screen in ages.I\\'ve seen the film twice. It is a wonder, marked by a sense of wondrous skepticism that has nothing to do with cynicism.It\\'s one of the best documentaries of this or any other year.Bar-Lev goes to the heart of the issue -- that all art, but especially abstract art -- demands commitment on every side, but commitment takes many forms and has many motives behind it. [][]When the focus narrows to the personal, the film becomes undeniably powerful in its specifics.You may not leave the theater having switched sides, but you\\'ll probably respect the other side more, and that in itself would be a victory for human life.For all its provocativeness, Lake of Fire is not a shapeless movie, nor a politically irresponsible one.Lake of Fire doesn\\'t tell you what to decide, it just gives you as much information as possible to make the choice yourself.At 152 minutes, his film doesn\\'t seem long, because at every moment something absorbing, disturbing, depressing or infuriating is happening.No one will have an easy time of it with Lake of Fire, a work of profound anguish centered on the abortion rights debate.Lake of Fire does something with the volatile subject of abortion that neutral observers and even political partisans can appreciate: It offers a wide representation of perspectives and opinions.It\\'s the arguments on both sides that make this long, gripping film such a vital contribution to the national conversation about abortion.Provides gruesome, incontrovertible images to complement its deliberations about morality.A 2 1/2 -hour documentary on abortion may sound like a hard sell, but the depth and scope of Tony Kaye\\'s grueling Lake of Fire nonetheless justifies feeling like you\\'ve just taken a long, blistering soak in one.There\\'s a madness to Lake Of Fire, a two-and-a-half hour documentary about abortion in America, that goes hand-in-glove with its staggering achievement.[Kaye has] taken his camera places and filmed things that neither side will want you see.Wherever you stand on the volatile issue of abortion, Tony Kaye\\'s exhaustive documentary could dislodge your certainties with a broad survey of opinion from opposite extremes and explicit depictions of medical procedures.Highly compelling, if overlong and overwrought.Viewer opinions about life and death provoked by Lake of Fire are not likely to flip, but they sure will get shaken.[The] film does nothing to advance the debate but does a great deal to show us what\\'s at stake.[A] passionate meditation on the fiery issue.One lesson of Lake of Fire is the galvanizing power of the visual image. Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words, and sometimes pictures are not enough. [][][]On the IMAX screen, these Irish rockers really rattle and hum.Inadvertently, U2 3D mimics perfectly the empty, intimacy-free spectacle that is stadium rock.U2 just look like four conceited billionaires who are further up themselves than ever.Bono should refrain from ramming his preachy political meanderings down our throats and let the music do the talking. Even if some of that music becomes a little stultifying.It\\'s not for nothing that these guys are the world\\'s finest live act.The playlist alone with thrill fans, but while spectacular, the 3D element still can\\'t replicate the feeling of a live gig.The 3-D visuals envelop you, majestically, and that effect fuses with the band\\'s surround-sound rapture to create a full-scale sensory high. U2 3D makes you feel stoned on movies.The 3-D element is unobtrusively handled, except when it perfectly re-creates the woman who\\'s always perched on her boyfriend\\'s shoulders in front of you at a concert...The concert itself is spectacularly produced, with Jumbotrons providing backdrop and long, curving runways that allow Bono and other band members to move far out into the crowd.The problem with U2 3D is that the U2 part is rarely as thrilling as the 3D part.Having these enormous, almost disembodied figures endlessly cascading through space is more distracting than illuminating.While U2 3D delivers what it promises to, it doesn\\'t do anything further.\"U2 in 3D\" doesn\\'t just give you the feeling of being at a rock concert. It gives you the feeling of being a rock star.The first Imax movie that deserves to be called a work of art.U23D only just begins to tap the potential of performance film in three dimensions, but the possibilities are thrilling to contemplate.It\\'s an incredible performance captured in a medium that attains a unique aesthetic of immediacy and humanity from the powerful rock quartet.The 3-D effects not only make you feel that Bono and crew are within arm\\'s reach, but also -- this is a new trick -- layer the pictures to simulate shifting your focus from foreground to background. This fascinating documentary examines the issues raised by Nader\\'s runs for the presidency...that shone a powerful light into our grubby political shadows, and also played a part...that twice put George W. Bush into the White House.It can\\'t help but remind us that the man Nader prevented from becoming president has since been more instrumental in the war on environmental pollution than any other public figure. Irony abounds.You may walk away from it still wondering why Nader persisted in running for president in 2004 after being repeatedly begged not to. But, whether or not you admire the decision, the film forces you to admire the determination with which Nader made it.This documentary starts out as a fascinating profile of consumer advocate Ralph Nader, but it ends up getting derailed by a political discussion marked by an abundance of whining.The first half of the movie is an absorbing study of this part of Nader\\'s public life, and then it switches -- as he did -- to politics, where the results for both him and the picture are less cheerful.An Unreasonable Man pays true homage to a man of vehemently held ideas by forcing us to engage our brains at the same high level of consciousness.For most of an entertaining 122 minutes, the film simply tells the story of Nader\\'s life and chronicles his struggles and crusades.Every time a belt gets buckled or an airbag inflates, the movie argues, somebody somewhere has Nader to thank for it.Though filled with talking heads and clocking in at two full hours, it\\'s thoroughly involving, and its two-part structure explicitly balances Nader\\'s phenomenal career as an anticorporate gadfly in the 60s and 70s with his role in the election of [Bush].The movie is lively and informative, but (in ways the old Nader might have appreciated) it made me feel like arguing with it. Frustratingly, the film avoids as many issues as it raises.Surely, Ralph Nader deserves better press than he\\'s been getting ever since the 2004 elections -- and the legendary consumer advocate and so-called presidential spoiler receives his due, from both sides, in the documentary An Unreasonable Man.Eschewing narration or direct questioning, the directors instead employ a vast archive of consistently engaging clips from Nader\\'s many congressional battles.Nader haters may not be mollified, but An Unreasonable Man, like its subject itself, is a one-stop civics lesson no one should miss.Structured chronologically and somewhat dryly, An Unreasonable Man makes a strong, nonhagiographic case for Nader\\'s impact: maturing under the influence of a verbal immigrant father.The film contends admiringly, and convincingly, that Ralph Nader\\'s authentic sense of outrage is the reason he persists when he can\\'t prevail.What An Unreasonable Man does best is rehabilitate Nader\\'s career prior to the election and remind us of an unparalleled public-interest legacy stretching over four decades.The compelling documentary An Unreasonable Man carries the tag line, \\'Ralph Nader: How do you define a legacy?\\' but it might just as easily have asked, \\'Who gets to define the legacy?\\'An entertaining tour of this endearing, infuriating absolutist\\'s life and legacy.A perceptive and beautifully made documentary portrait of Nader.A spellbinding cautionary tale about the dangers of purity and the ugly necessity of compromise and pragmatism. []Too often with documentaries, we get only the tears. There is no second act or resolution. Christopher Quinn\\'s God Grew Tired of Us gives us reason to hope about a human catastrophe.Not as good, nor as complex, as The Lost Boys, but that doesn\\'t make the story of mass annihilation, sprawling refugee camps, the generosity of Americans, and the resilience of a handful of Sudanese survivors any less worthy of telling -- again.There\\'s no way to not like [John] Dau. Or for that matter, God Grew Tired of Us.Their journey isn\\'t over -- many in Africa still desperately need help -- but the hope and opportunities America offers are a grand place to start.The film affirms that if it is possible to survive when you have lost your home, family, and country, it is possible to start over and prevail.Can there really be no footage of their uncertainty, anger at unfriendly Americans, even an embrace of bad habits?This moving documentary by Christopher Quinn vividly contrasts the material hunger of the third world (on the plane trip over the men devour the condiments included with their airline meal) and the spiritual starvation of the first world.A documentary to make you proud of what America offers to the rest of the world and worried that it can\\'t keep its promises.Three Sudanese men struggle to adjust to life in the United States -- from their perspective, a very strange place -- in this affecting and well-made culture-shock documentary.While it is emotionally and spiritually satisfying, its optimistic point of view avoids harder truths it might have explored.[An] affecting and engaging film.It\\'s worth seeing simply for the reunion between one of the men, a lovely spirit named John Bul Dau, and his long-separated mother.Two unimaginable journeys become more than imaginable in God Grew Tired Of Us, a documentary by Christopher Quinn and Tommy Walker -- the movie makes them vivid and memorable. This is a film that adds to our understanding of human nature.God Grew Tired of Us doesn\\'t add much to this twice-told story. Still, just a few months after the cruelties of Borat, it\\'s instructive to see again how truly foreign America is to much of the world.There are surprising comic elements to this well-drawn and involving portrait of a group of \\'Lost Boys,\\' the term for the thousands of Christian Sudanese refugees who were chased out of that country by murderous squads of Muslims starting in the 1980s.Narrated by Nicole Kidman, this poignant documentary tells only half the story of three Sudanese \\'lost boys\\' who emigrate to America. Though it doesn\\'t delve as deep as it should, this movie will still break your heart.Sending help does seem to be the primary purpose of God Grew Tired Of Us, which at worst plays like surface-level propaganda, however touching and persuasive its message turns out to be.By focusing on these hardworking and eloquent young men, the film brings into clear light the indefatigability of the human spirit.God Grew Tired of Us adopts a low-key observational style that takes us through the protagonists\\' adventures from their point of view, though the filmmakers can\\'t help registering locals\\' amazed reactions to their new neighbors. []If it...verges on being just slightly patronising at times, that\\'s a quarrel with the filmmakers, not its participants.It\\'s a pity that director Stephen Walker, who also narrates, imposes so much of himself on the material, asking at times the most insensitive questions.As an interviewer Walker is habitually condescending and sometimes downright inane...The wonderful members of the choir, truly young at heart, overcome the occasional clumsiness of the filmmaker and you come away from this film feeling genuinely uplifted.The devil may have all the best tunes, but it\\'s the elderly who nail them. Charming, heartwarming and totally kick-ass, you\\'ll never look at your grandparents in the same way.Sure, these \\'zesty\\', \\'lively\\' old folks are enjoying themselves. The question is why on earth we should be expected to watch.That might be because the film has already been shown on the BBC - a fact that, along with the unprepossessing production values, rather begs the question of why bother with a cinematic release at all?A lovely little film.A worse film might be dismissed as sobsploitation. But Stephen Walker\\'s documentary - a labour of love inspired by Walker\\'s first sight of the group in a London West End show - touches the mind as well as the heart.That not all of them do sadly lends a much-needed emotional depth to a doc that, odd beautiful moments aside, can feel like a solid reality TV hour stretched out to 108 minutes. Bring hankies.They more than justify a film which, despite its faults, makes the winter of life less terrifying than it\\'s made out to be.A more genuinely sweet and uplifting documentary I have not seen in quite a while.Young@Heart is nothing less than an ode to joy.An undeniably sweet mix of disarming honesty, inspired gumption and brutal reality, Young@Heart somehow manages to avoid the maudlin while enhancing the obvious with its portrait of a chorus of senior citizens who sing contemporary rock songs.What makes Young@Heart such an ingratiating experience goes far deeper than the novelty of seeing old people singing hard rock tunes.In many ways, this serious side of Young@Heart is what ultimately makes the film memorable.A chorus (average age 80) prepares for a springtime tour, putting their signature spin on classics--classics like The Clash\\'s \"Should I Stay or Should I Go.\"The project reeks of commercial calculation, which is just tolerable until Walker, in search of a story arc, follows two chorus members with serious illnesses into the hospital.One of the most remarkable scenes you will ever see in a documentary is the chorus of elderly men and women -- average age of 80 -- singing Bob Dylan\\'s \\'Forever Young\\' before convicts in a Massachusetts penitentiary. [][][]An unsettling portrait of a broken family.A searing and intimate account of an unconventional woman struggling not to lose her identity or her sanity in the rigid 1950s suburban world of stay-at-home moms, well-behaved children and sparkling-clean houses.Like other family doc gothics, the heart of the suburbs is-gasp!-black as bile; unlike them, however, this has a strong female voice that gives us chills from beyond the graveA bloodcurdling 75-minute diary assembled from an astonishing stash of audiotapes and Dictaphone recordings, cries and whispers out of one documentary filmmaker\\'s family history.Dews helps Allis hold out a gendered posthumous snapshot of an era whose smug surface, barely masking oceans of suffering, makes Revolutionary Road look like a tea party.File this \\'therapeutic\\' movie, well made and creepy, on the dysfunction-as-art shelf ?√á¬ønext to Capturing the Friedmans.A spare but riveting documentary.Dews wisely realizes that he needs nothing more than his grandparents\\' writings, recordings and home movies to portray the stark emptiness of Allis\\' life, as well as the sexist, neurotically conformist culture that smothered her.Raises unsettling questions about the erosion of the private sphere.The urgency of Allis\\' message to us -- not \"please\" but \"must read\" -- is most honorably discharged and her story lets us hear the voice that was almost silenced.Morgan Dews has fashioned his documentary with a historian\\'s skill and an artist\\'s eye.The relentless negativity in Must Read After My Death can become overwhelming at times, but it\\'s undeniably mesmerizing.I watched this film horrified and fascinated. There is such raw pain here.A mesmerizing survey of a family caught up in personal psychodrama, a Running With Scissors without the laughs.I can recommend this film with the proviso that you don\\'t have to accept it at face value. For myself, I found its frankness entrancing.A riveting, fly-on-the-wall documentary using only silent home movies and audio recordings of a family in steep, depressing decline.Intimately, poetically evokes the banal tragedies of one family\\'s 1960s Hartford, CT life. [][]Julien Temple\\'s film is an energizing work of art, a visually striking and inspiring look at a band that never \\'sold out\\' and the leader who saw to it that they didn\\'t.The big unanswerable question is: Do we wish Strummer would have listened to David Lee Roth\\'s advice that \"You don\\'t have to take life so seriously, honey\"?Miracle of miracles, a valuable portrait of Strummer manages to emerge from the chaos, helped by the film\\'s one consistent thread: tapes of a BBC World Service radio show he hosted in his final years.Temple, who chronicled the Sex Pistols...offers the full, sometimes bloated, context of Strummer\\'s life through the testimony of his many friends and collaborators.Temple\\'s film is a fittingly conscientious and absorbing tribute to his complex, contradictory personality.A beautiful, evocative collage composed of concert footage, photographs, interviews and film clips, as well as interviews with people who knew him, the film is a rigorously thorough biography and an impassioned accolade.Temple has plenty of cinematic tricks and willing interview subjects.Compelling viewing, even for people who don\\'t care a bit for the punk scene.One of the most compelling documentary portraits of a musician yet made.Future is overlong and will best be enjoyed and understood by fans, but even newcomers will appreciate the essential drive of the man, who died of a sudden heart attack in 2002, and admire his ability to balance anger and ecstasy.The story illustrates how easily political art can be hijacked by the other side, and it illuminates the anguish of a man who spent the last 20 years of his life wrestling with his legacy.Temple\\'s film offers a rich, detailed portrait of a commanding but idealistic Strummer against the backdrop of the do-it-yourself punk ethos of the late \\'70s.The Future Is Written is a loving testimonial to one of rock\\'s true originals.Julian Temple has done cinematic justice to the punk humanist born John Graham Mellor.Suffused with clear-eyed affection for its subject and times, this is not your little brother\\'s punk documentary.The singer\\'s life is compressed into a two-hour montage of interviews, vintage video snippets and artsy filigree in Joe Strummer: The Future is Unwritten.Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is one artist\\'s moving tribute to another: director Julien Temple\\'s poetic evocation of the life of punk\\'s greatest troubadour.Leaves behind a surprising afterglow and allows you to appreciate Joe Strummer\\'s warmth. Theater fans will give it a standing ovation; others may be moved only to polite applause.There\\'s loads of talent on display (from puppets to Boy George), plus plenty of dish about them all.For those who believe there\\'s no business like show business, this documentary will be a singular sensation.For the Broadway babies out there, ShowBusiness will make you want to schedule a trip to the Great White Way.Bright lights, big drama. A delectable trip down Broadway.This is an entertaining visit to a strange planet.It is filled with neurotic people in greasepaint, some charming, most amusing, and by the time you\\'ve spent an hour and a half with them, you\\'re more than invested in their lives and cares.Along the way, the film includes insightful observations about the creative process.In the end, I wish Berenstein had devoted her filmmaking to two musicals instead of four, thus affording even more screen time to each show\\'s creative process (the audition process, the choreography, early rehearsals and such).The film\\'s slick and entertaining, an obvious must-see for musical hounds. It holds water for laypeople, though, because the insights into a communal creative process are so sharp.Sheds much-needed light on a fascinating show-business institution.Dori Berinstein\\'s cameras catch gallant theater people doing what they\\'ve done since Sophocles was a pup: rehearsing, revising, worrying, learning, stretching, struggling to bump things up from good to wonderful and constantly, fervently hoping.Dori Berinstein\\'s fine documentary chronicles the production of four high-profile musicals during the 2003-\\'04 New York theater season.Much of this strikingly human, rapidly paced and laudably well-rounded film is fascinating.The film is a love letter to theater and the people who make it.Following the shows from rehearsals to Tony Awards night, [director Dori Berenstein] gets behind the scenes and does a good job conveying the incessant anxieties and glee of the talents involved.A smart, highly entertaining piece of cinema-reportage.Made with care and affection.Short on insight. You\\'ll have to look elsewhere than this love letter to the Great White Way to explain why Wicked and Avenue Q became huge hits, and why Caroline, or Change joined Taboo as a costly flop.What stands out, not surprisingly, is the work and passion that goes into the shows. But seeing all this from the inside creates an extraordinary level of empathy for those involved. Something to behold.This 2005 feature is demanding to say the least, but its pulse-slowing rhythms leave a real sense of peace.A transcendental piece of filmmaking.At once eerie, picaresque, evocative, and utterly alien to the reality most viewers inhabit, Into Great Silence is a daring and breathtakingly constructed documentary dream.As a place to enter and meditate, Into Great Silence is imminently worthy, but as a documentary, it doesn\\'t do enough to probe the meaning of the quotation Grning returns to repeatedly: \"Oh Lord, you have seduced me, and I was seduced.\"On a philosophical level, Into Great Silence emphasizes the virtues of the ascetic life, returning again and again to the idea of giving away all possessions in order to become a true disciple.[Some] viewers are likely to consider this nearly three-hour, nearly soundless documentary as a chance to catch up on their sleep.As we vicariously participate in their daily rituals, we find ourselves at the ground level of spiritual worship. It\\'s hard to recall a similar documentary that brings viewers so palpably close to that sacred experience.Into Great Silence is a film of great spiritual intensity and haunting minimalism that enlarges your concepts of movies and of life.Have I got a movie for you. Into Great Silence is a two-hour-and-40-minute documentary about monks, and it is one of the transporting film experiences of this or any other year.The silence captured in this documentary may be the most eloquent you\\'ll ever hear.A challenging but worth-it experience for more reasons than one can actually speak (or write) in words. It\\'s a documentary to be watched over time, with a Carthusian level of contemplation.Though it likely will not persuade people to join the ranks, experiencing life behind the walls has an undeniable effect. We\\'ve been allowed a glimpse of eternity. And who would not be changed by that?Their silence is full to the brim with incidental sound that functions as both score and narration in this hyper-empathic film.For two hours and 42 minutes, Into Great Silence offers painterly images of an existence that is, almost literally, too reverent for words.Groning then moved into the isolated, centuries-old monastery and for six months, minus crew or artificial light, recorded the monks\\' daily routine. The result is the seductive documentary Into Great Silence.Into Great Silence is one of those films -- Martin Scorsese\\'s Kundun is another example -- wherein the spiritual aspiration of the filmmaker informs, and even exalts, the film itself.There are definitely moments of poetry and sweetness, and it is a notable achievement, years in the making.It sounds more like an endurance test than entertainment, yet this one-of-a-kind experience proves surprisingly immersive.A rapturous, absorbing experience -- it has no voice-over, no back story or history, no archival footage and no talking heads -- but only if you can surrender yourself to it. ... outstanding documentary ...It\\'s fascinating that this portrait of the rise, fall and rise of Midwestern organic farmer John Peterson can be read in so many different ways, only some of which appear intentionally in Taggart Siegel\\'s sympathetic documentary.Of interest even to those not particularly interested in the subject of farming.A beguiling combination of agrarian ode and The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test, deepened by Peterson\\'s square sincerity as he struggles to find himself in relation to his family\\'s land.The Real Dirt on Farmer John turns into a portrait of how American family farming could blossom for a new century.Warmhearted.\\'What do you do when nothing is left?\\' is the question that drives The Real Dirt on Farmer John.It does leave you smiling -- and just a little bit hungry.Don\\'t be surprised if, by the finish, you wind up fantasizing about your own rural homestead.What a blessing this film is, for everyone who\\'s chosen the road less taken, and even perhaps for anyone who\\'s stood in their way.At times, the film plays like an extended infomercial for John\\'s new company, Angelic Organics, but the agrarian fantasy is so compelling here that the revitalization of the American family farm begins to seem not just possible, but probable.The Real Dirt on Farmer John is the healthiest film on the block.Even at 82 minutes, the film kind of stagnates and repeats itself.The Real Dirt on Farmer John examines 50-odd years in the life of its eponymous subject -- a most compelling character -- and in doing so literally provides the viewer with food for thought.A loose, amiable documentary tracking several decades in the life of this most unusual farmer.Regardless of what you think the movie is about, it has a fascinating subject: John Peterson, farmer, performance artist, author and, at times, a flamboyant thorn in his neighbors\\' side.Effectively links the political and artistic rebellions of the \\'60s to the ecological movements of today, while mounting a strong case against the effects of today\\'s agribusiness monoliths.This is a loving, moving, inspiring, quirky documentary that was made while the lives it records were being lived. The story Schroeder unfolds is also his own-that of a generation that had its humanistic sympathies manipulated by unscrupulous people with agendas of horror.[][]The movie functions crackingly well as a non-fiction international thriller.The lawyer\\'s intense isolation, his solitary, perverse rage against the world, against France, against conventional opinion, is felt most deeply.Schroeder\\'s film, which combines interviews with many of the key figures in Vergs\\' career with grainy historical footage, lets its subject speak for itself but leaves little doubt of where the filmmaker stands.For just a moment, ignore politics. Consider Jacques Vergs simply as star. The radical French lawyer is an absolutely compelling figure onscreen: exotic, resolute, beguilingly smug.Jacques Vergs makes for compelling documentary film fodder: He is arrogant, cosmopolitan, politically unpredictable and enmeshed in the roots of modern international terrorism.A panorama of European radicalism.A brilliant study in the link between moral corruption and narcissism.If nothing else, Terror\\'s Advocate offers a useful summary of the last half-century of global politics, and how changing public perceptions can make goats out of heroes.Talk about a hard sell.Jacques Vergs is such a compelling, complex and contradictory character that if he didn\\'t exist someone would be obliged to invent him. It is the gift of Terror\\'s Advocate to simply present Vergs as is.Terror\\'s Advocate is one of the most engaging, morally unsettling political thrillers in quite some time, with the extra advantage of being true.Jacques Vergs had defended a lot of people, and it\\'s his Zelig-like journey through the politics of the postwar 20th century that is the contentious subject of Barbet Schroeder\\'s unwieldy, unforgettable film.That [director] Schroeder doesn\\'t offer simple explanations gives his tale honesty and fascination.The title Terror\\'s Advocate is both a statement of fact and a worrisome understatement in a documentary as slippery as its subject.Engrossing.Scarcely an expos, Terror\\'s Advocate is more plainly a portrait of a man as a timeline.Sure to inspire debate in France and Germany and of obvious interest to anyone who follows the roots of modern international terrorism, doc probes gray areas in the colorful life of its controversial, limelight-courting subject. For its glimpses of various lifestyles and personalities -- an ancient but spry fiddler, a young male who performs in drag -- it isn\\'t bad.Gypsy Caravan - When the Road Bends evokes the US tour of Roma musicians whose astonishing diversity ranges from the Indian group with their bejewelled drag dancer to oompah-based Romanians.So long seen as ragged leftovers from an older historical epoch, the Roma turn out to be a modern people who have a lot to teach over-developed societies about what it means to be human.These extraordinary musicians ought to put an end to any sniffiness about Gypsy music.The poverty contrasts sharply with the excitement of the tour bus and cuts to the heart of the songs themselves, famed for their \"joy and sorrow\".If you have any ear for non-Western music, Gypsy Caravan is a must.The emphasis remains on the personal stories of the players themselves who, for all their backstage squabbling, identify more with each other than any of the countries in which they\\'ve settled.The camera work is always note-perfect.If music were all, Gypsy Caravan would be amazing. As is, it\\'s worth seeing, but you may get frustrated at the way Dellal raises provocative questions about ancestry and prejudice...The personalities of the players also contribute energy. They are an immensely charismatic bunch.Throughout, the ebullience and passion of the music gives viewers a point of entry into what it means to be Roma, part of an ancient culture in a modern world.It\\'s hardly surprising that Gypsy Caravan, a lively and lovely music documentary, is rife with whirling rhythms, wild, soaring melodic lines, the ululations of singers steeped in centuries of Romany tradition.Gypsy Caravan has been compared with Tony Gatlif\\'s 1993 film Latcho Drom, which took a dreamier approach to Gypsy culture. This one\\'s more down-to-earth, but it\\'s just as entertaining.Not quite fully satisfying as either cinematic ethnography or as a concert film.Caravan sounds great and if nothing else should help diminish the stereotype, blasted by the film\\'s subjects, of Gypsies as little more than pickpockets whom travelers need to be wary of.Gypsy Caravan could have used some judicious trimming, but you forgive Dellal her excesses as she forgives her artists theirs. This is music to gorge on, raw ethnic survival in the form of sound.This chronicle of a Gypsy-music package tour is a powerful rejoinder to rock-doc navel-gazing. Stunning performance excerpts, ranging from Spanish flamenco to Indian raga, demonstrate that keening brass choirs are just one aspect of the Gypsy sound.Uncovers the same joy and sorrow that characterizes the Romani music in the everyday lives of the musicians who play it.It\\'s easy to see why [director] Dellal had trouble turning the camera off, especially when confronted with a startling and sad plot twist. Viewers are urged to grab an aisle seat, the better to dance when the music moves them -- as it surely will.As a music document and as a labor of unabashed love, the nonfiction feature Gypsy Caravan could hardly be better; as a movie, it could stand some improvement. [][]It is wonderful to watch this joyous slice of the cultural lives of these victimized, traumatized children struggling to survive and build a better life in a desperately troubled part of the world.This film offers a child\\'s perspective on the ravages and complexity of war and is also a convincing testament to the healing power of creative expression.\\'The world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong at the broken places,\\' Hemingway wrote in A Farewell to Arms. That statement might stand as the summation of this documentary, which celebrates the strength of winsome, broken children.Because no one dares to call a film about suffering children boring, Fine and Nix slack on analysis and investigation and concentrate on gorgeous saturated cinematographyThe horror and heartwarming [is] equally compounded.War/Dance is the sort of documentary that\\'s meant to appall us, to shake us out of our uninformed complacency. And yet there are moments in the film that may make an audience uncomfortable in ways the Fines may not have intended.War/Dance is two documentaries struggling uneasily against each other. The one that wins -- the only one that matters, really -- is a devastatingly emotional saga about Ugandan children of war reclaiming their lives.The joyous song and vibrant dance of the schoolchildren uplift all who see them. They are war orphans, casualties of Uganda\\'s civil strife, healing physical and psychic wounds by performing ancient tribal rites in a national competition.This is documentary-making at its best, not pretending to be journalism, but still playing a crucial role in telling stories that otherwise wouldn\\'t make the front page.Even in support of the noblest of causes, manipulation is manipulation.A marvel to watch.The filmmaking style is annoyingly slick, but the testimonies of these children are excruciatingly moving.War/Dance is as irresistible as the rhythms of African music on its soundtrack.War/Dance is an honorable, sometimes inspiring exploration of the primal healing power of music and dance in an African tribal culture.There isn\\'t enough uplift, gratuitous or otherwise, in the world to make you forget the graphic testimony of children compelled by rebel forces either to watch atrocities or commit them.It doesn\\'t just feature music and dance numbers; it\\'s got romping, stomping, blow-the-doors-off, celebration-of-life music and dance numbers.The cinematography is striking. The music is mesmerizing. And the triumph of the underdog team against all odds is extra satisfying.I\\'d be lying if I didn\\'t say it overcame my naturally complacent instincts. Proves even more revealing than the photographs it celebrates.An astonishing visual indictment of man\\'s inhumanity to Mother Earth, as seen through the documentary prism of Jennifer Baichwal.[][][][]What the film does well is to make us part of the problem: After all we demand the lowest prices in everything we buy and that probably means it was made in China.My first question: What kind of nefarious events had to occur so that I could purchase the computer with which I write this review?Feels constrained and rather dutiful, no matter how passionate these people are about what they\\'re observing.Burtynsky calls for \"a whole new way of thinking\" about the world\\'s economy and ecology, though he never says what\\'s wrong with the old way.The movie works best traveling from the eye straight to the conscience.Again and again, Baichwal tapers passages of her film toward resolution in the form of a finished picture by Burtynsky, telescoping her vision and his.Unfortunately this film, for all its mesmerizing merits, isn\\'t that alarm, the clock still ticking to doomsday while we all continue to sit by and twiddle our thumbs in misbegotten stupor.Opens with [an] extended moment: a 10-minute-long tracking shot of workers, rows and rows and rows of them, putting in their hours at a Chinese factory. It\\'s an epic touch and reason enough to see this movie in a theater with a large screen.Without browbeating, hectoring, lecturing or sermonizing, Manufactured Landscapes makes an inelegant point elegantly. The point: Humanity is altering the landscape drastically and by implication irrevocably.Manufactured Landscapes is a visual poem, an irony in that it moves slowly while capturing beauty about industrial life which is rarely either.What\\'s remarkable is that [Baichwal\\'s] footage manages to add meaning to the photographs, already so powerful on their own.A mesmerizing work of visual oncology, a witness to a cancer that\\'s visible only at a distance but entwined with the DNA of everything we buy and everywhere we shop. We are not in charge of this, you may want to reply. If not, who is?Doesn\\'t go very far beneath the surface, or ask many provocative questions.Yet another \\'isn\\'t it a pity\\' doc, where the damnable inequity of globalization provides an occasion for muted, impotent rage. [][]The tension builds incrementally, reaching almost unbearable heights at its dizzying climax.It all makes for an absorbing, mischievously amusing yarn, whose climax unfolds with unexpected emotional force.In this exhilarating, palm-moistening documentary by British filmmaker James Marsh (Wisconsin Death Trip), the twin towers are back to celebrate one of their finest moments.Though we know how it ends, it unfolds with suspense. And though it lacks any discussion of the towers\\' destruction, it succeeds as a tribute to their birth.By any rational gauge, Petit\\'s WTC obsession was flat-out crazy, but Marsh takes a limpid, nonjudgmental view of it all.It\\'s a story worth telling, yes -- but after 90 minutes, it\\'s hard not to wonder if the storyteller can talk about anything else.The erasure of the towers adds poignance and irony to a documented event that is inherently thrilling and beautiful.James Marsh\\'s documentary is the story of the dreaming and scheming that went into the walk, which I hesitate to call a stunt. It seems too glib a word for a feat that inspired the poignant complex of emotions uncovered by Marsh\\'s narrative.Marsh uses a combination of interviews, film of Petit as a young man, authentic newsreels and enacted reconstructions to produce an unforgettable experience.It\\'s a hell of a story, and Petit is a mesmerising storyteller, with an extravagantly poetic turn of phrase and the glittering eye of the Ancient Mariner.Marsh stitches his story together with a seamless melding of interviews, stills, re-enactments and archival footage augmented by a wonderful score by Michael Nyman and the New York composer J. Ralph.Sufferers from vertigo be warned: Man on Wire contains some of the most amazing scenes of hire-wire brilliance ever filmed.James Marsh tells Petit\\'s story, the most inspiring \\'heist\\' in modern history, a Frenchman\\'s stroll between two 110 story buildings in lower Manhattan.In archival photos Petit seems to float between the towers, a tiny black figure against a vivid blue sky; the images are all the more poignant for the unstated fact that Petit is still around when the buildings aren\\'t.Man On Wire is an engrossing film that captures the imagination and never ceases to entertain.More, Marsh manages to capture the imagination and make it soar to heights you usually only associate with powerful Grade-A literature, not with a documentary feature.Astonishing. Daring. Mind-boggling. Visually stunning. A true heart-stopper. And, oh yeah, the movie\\'s pretty good, too.It\\'s a rare tale of dangerous obsession rapturously fulfilled, a reminder that even the most quixotic of undertakings can knock over a windmill now and then. Persepolis meets Full Metal Jacket in Ari Folman\\'s powerful and original animated war film.These depictions of the dementia of war have a hallucinatory power that can stand alongside those of Apocalypse Now.The message of the futility of war has rarely been painted with such bold strokes.Special, strange and peculiarly potent.The look of Waltz with Bashir is what is most arresting. It\\'s a deep, multi-plane style of animation that incorporates photo-real settings, realistic renderings of the people and under-animated movement, especially of faces.A dreamy, animated psycho-documentary.A wholly original and emotionally devastating animated documentary confessional.Animation may be the ideal medium for replicating dreams, and in this unsettling feature by Ari Folman it also proves well suited to autobiography.It is powerful because this work of art also provides such a cautionary tale about the psychic burdens young soldiers carry deep inside them decades after they\\'ve laid down their weapons.A brave, personal and truly original piece of filmmaking.A unique, Oscar-nominated \\'animated documentary\\' that uses graphic-novel-style animation to deal with the Israeli army\\'s participation in the Lebanon war of 1982.The flatness and stiff, jerky movement of the drawing contribute to the dreamlike, increasing dread-filled atmosphere of the visuals, which burst finally into actual filmed images of devastating impact.It\\'s a fearless and unblinking march into the heart of one man\\'s darkness and the pain and anguish of generations and nations.The film looks ripped straight from Folman\\'s psyche and placed in a theater near you.Waltz With Bashir isn\\'t only a harrowing anti-war plea, it is also an eloquent and deeply moving argument that it is critical to never forget human atrocity, lest the past be repeated.A powerful, poignant and provocative film, told in an unconventional and effective fashion.Waltz With Bashir, a movie about memory, is as devious and subversive as it is brilliant and nightmarish.An extraordinary achievement, Ari Folman\\'s Waltz With Bashir is a detective story as well as an moral inquiry into the specific horrors of one war, and one man\\'s buried memories of that war.A transcendent shattering of what viewers should expect from traditional animation or the standard documentary film. Ari Folman\\'s dream-like journey into his own memory is a must-see.Bashir wasn\\'t healing for me. On the contrary, it leaves much unresolved, but in the pacifist, passive horror recovered by its amnesiacs, I found it stunning -- in both meanings of the word -- and emotionally cathartic. []Burma VJ celebrates the courage of the Democratic Voice of Burma (DVB), a group of underground journalists who risked their lives to document the 2007 uprising against the junta.Burma VJ would be even more intense without its early announcement that some scenes have been restaged, putting the viewer in a regrettably uncertain relationship to what follows.Narrated by a frightened journalist who trembles as he accumulates forbidden footage and provides a historical viewpoint, \"Burma VJ\" uses shocking video images and reconstructed scenes to create a coherent, mostly chronological account of what happened.In traditional terms, this is hardly a film at all. It\\'s more like a bootlegged YouTube video.Although directed by Denmark\\'s Anders Ostergaard, the true heroes of Burma VJ are the cadres of guerrilla video journalists who secretly filmed the junta\\'s brutal suppression of the popular revolt in the fall of 2007.An awe-inspiring documentary by Denmark\\'s Anders Ostergaard that tracks how the news escaped in 2007 during Burma\\'s civil uprising.Thanks to the new guerrilla narrative, the world has a constant flow of images to file in its collective consciousness. And that camera-testable accountability slowly becomes a global civic right that fulfills the noblest purpose of journalism.Watch this and you will long remember Burma - and briefly join a revolution.Burma VJ documents the work of such courageous journalists, who, at the risk of imprisonment or worse, film antigovernment activities using small consumer cameras.An inspiring, and occasionally horrifying, documentary.Compelling and, for anyone who values truth, essential.It\\'s a flawlessly constructed piece of work, as relentlessly gripping as it is educational, a righteous and even uplifting paean to the continued importance of collective protest.With visceral power, they show how the support of Burma\\'s monks gave vital authority to the protests.Anders Ostergaard\\'s documentary mixes a small amount of re-enactment - scenes of the Thai-based boss co-ordinating action by phone - with large amounts of scary, shocking or in some cases infamously celebrated footage.It\\'s guerilla film-making of amazing courage.A moving and galvanic account.The footage, smuggled to Norway via Thailand, is raw and compelling. The story of how it was sneaked out is worthy of the best thrillers.There\\'s no doubting that this is a hugely important film.Even as the news-gathering apparatus in the US and elsewhere falters under the weight of new technology and outdated business models, Burma VJ is a fresh reminder that reporters can and must serve as a necessary Paine in the rear. []A thoughtful, informative and thoroughly entertaining examination of the role of performance-enhancing drugs in modern life.A lively and incisive look into the nation\\'s growing preoccupation with pumped-up superlatives.Unexpectedly funny [and] sometimes angry.Smart, touching and enlightening, a combination that makes Bigger, Stronger, Faster the best documentary of the year so far.By making this journey personal, a powerful vulnerability permeates the film.It\\'ll shake up your beliefs not just about steroids but about competition, hypocrisy, body obsession and American notions of masculinity.Bell posits that their disillusionment is a side effect of being American and he may well be right.Bigger, Stronger, Faster* is that rare film that truly challenges its audience.A hugely entertaining personal documentary about what steroids mean to American pop culture.Bigger, Stronger, Faster* may prove to be more than just a good time at the movies; it could be another Super Size Me ... only bigger. Muscle, after all, weighs more than fat.This movie is remarkable in that it seems to be interested only in facts.The film isn\\'t quite a memoir; it\\'s also a platform to branch off into other areas, briskly and informatively and with a good deal of clearheadedness.There\\'s been a glut of pointless first- person documentaries lately, but newcomer Christopher Bell has a legitimate personal take in his film about Americans who use anabolic steroids.Powerful stuff.It\\'s a fascinating and unexpectedly profound and melancholy meditation on what we have become as a country and on the misguided obsessions that made us this way.Bigger, Stronger, Faster* left me convinced that the steroid scandals will abate as the drugs are reluctantly accepted as inevitable products of a continuing revolution in biotechnology.Bigger, Stronger, Faster* offers persuasive examples of circumstances in which we let people make their own choices, no matter how dimwitted, from plastic-surgery addiction to daredevil stunts.Steroids as demonized innocents is a tough pill to swallow, and while Bell isn\\'t out to build a clear case, he succeeds in muddying the waters.The performance-enhancing quality behind this muscular movie is director Chris Bell\\'s willingness to go far beyond the call of duty. [][]\\'God\\'s gonna trouble the water,\\' goes the chorus from the African-American spiritual that gives Trouble the Water its title, but no deity is to blame for the tide of bureaucratic bungling and inhumanity the movie reveals.The person at the centre emerges as a force of nature unto herself. Meet, and prepare to be inspired by, Kimberly Rivers Roberts.Essential, startling and distressing insight into what it was like to be in the eye of the Katrina storm if you were a poor, black resident of the Ninth Ward of New Orleans on Monday August 29 2005.The footage - edited and augmented by Michael Moore\\'s collaborators Tia Lessin and Carl Deal - is unpolished, but the stories and commentary are as inspirational as they are harrowing.Tia Lessin and Carl Deal\\'s movie about Hurricane Katrina is, in its way, quite as powerful as Spike Lee\\'s massive documentary on the subject.I could call the film an important document, but it\\'s far more rowdy and vital, and amazingly unpretentious, than that makes it sound.Later, unfortunately, the film\\'s energy drains like the waters, leaving a wrack of tired folk wisdoms and ear-injuring rap songs.This gutsy doc, directed by the producers of Bowling For Columbine, has a raw, grass-roots perspective that makes the social devastation sink in afresh.You can\\'t help wanting -- and maybe needing -- to read into her indomitable spiritedness something like a reason for hope. For her, for other Katrina survivors, for all of us.It\\'s not quite a Grapes of Wrath for our times, but Trouble the Water does give a voice to people America didn\\'t see or listen to before Katrina.More than most documentaries, this mosaiclike movie is made up of many pieces, and it\\'s considerably more than the sum of those parts.Trouble the Water is a crucial film, one of the best of the decade.A tale of natural and civic catastrophe, Trouble the Water is also a frank yet inspired saga about poverty, survival and what lies beyond.Trouble the Water is choppy, overly long and at times almost indecipherable, but it\\'s indelible.Roberts needs more practice at holding the camera steady and framing shots. It doesn\\'t matter. We feel her footage at the base of our spines.Trouble the Water, along with Spike Lee\\'s extraordinary four-hour epic, When the Levees Broke, remains one of the most eloquent records we have of a tragedy that brought out some of the most impressively alive men and women in New OIs there more to be said about this national catastrophe? Yes, definitely, as the engrossing documentary Trouble the Water shows in just about every frame.Filmmakers Tia Lessin and Carl Deal have fashioned a deeply moving story of resilience and redemption. For all its melancholy and its profound awareness of mortality, The Beaches of Agn?¬øs is one of the jolliest, more life-affirming self-portraits in recent cinema.Varda, free from fear and shame, turns her tale of a life lived in art into a work of art in its own right, and one of her best-a rapturous tribute to life itself.[][]As evidenced in The Beaches of Agn?¬øs, Varda is too venerable to be hip -- and too wholly alive to be venerated.The Beaches of Agnes is a work of delightful contradictions from a filmmaker who has always played by her own rules.Filmmakers don\\'t usually do documentaries about themselves, but Agnes Varda\\'s The Beaches of Agnes is good enough to start a trend.A puckish, moving and wonderfully eccentric tour through her life.A witty and engaging cine-autobiography.Although you will get more out of this self-portrait if you\\'re a film-lover, it can be enjoyed simply for its touching, eloquent reflections on life in general.It\\'s impossible not to open your heart to this film.A loose-leaf diary in which the pages are shuffled by instinct, wit and surreal art.There\\'s not much discipline and it\\'s way too long, but in common with her best work, it has a dreamy sort of charm.A little self-absorbed but a charming, visually elegant portrait of a life both ordinary and extraordinary.Tender, truthful, happy-making: The Beaches of Agnes is a wonderful film by a wonderful woman.Compelling and intriguing, this is the perfect director\\'s autobiography.Varda recalls her childhood, her adulthood, her politics, and how both her films and her two children were born. She doesn\\'t just show us, she takes us inside of it all, inside of her. It\\'s a reverie.The warm, elfin filmmaker makes a fine companion through this vivid story of a life well lived, reminding us at the end of how we create our own safe havens within our families.Replete with clips and anecdotes, The Beaches of Agnes is a treat to anyone who already cherishes Varda\\'s films and a perfect primer for those who haven\\'t yet discovered her work.A captivating cine-memoir, impressionistic and surrealistic, surveying Varda\\'s formidable career as a still photographer, filmmaker, documentarian, and life force. This is as insightful a glimpse into a country\\'s cinema as you\\'re likely to see at this running time.It\\'s all very foul, and completely entertaining.Not Quite Hollywood is jammed with well-preserved clips of the Aussie movies that started pushing the limits after censorship was essentially dropped in 1971.If Not Quite Hollywood is not quite convincing, it is quite entertaining.What\\'s cool and always kicky is seeing a country\\'s irreverent movie trash being treated with such, well, reverence.All in all, this is a celebration of Australian exuberance, a national ethic of adventurousness and enormous charisma.Although Not Quite Hollywood was clearly put together with fanatical love, the suspicion remains, as often with genre cinema, that these trash-rich movies are a lot more fun to hear about, and to watch in snatches, than to sit through.There are clips from more than 80 movies crammed into 100 consistently hilarious and jaw-dropping minutes, from soft- and hard-core porn to cheesy , gory horror movies to biker and car chase movies that make The Fast and the Furious look positively tame.It\\'s a kicky, slightly exhausting look at a bygone era of low-rent moviemaking, whose colorful trove of film clips should delight fans of cinematic esoterica, nostalgic schlock and high octane drive-in fare.This film is an affectionate, rollicking guide to the drive-in classics of Australian filmmaking from the 1970s and \\'80s.A survey of the week wouldn\\'t be complete without a left-handed salute -- not to be confused with a backhanded compliment -- to the gleeful rubbish of Not Quite Hollywood: The Wild, Untold Story of Ozploitation!Think of Not Quite Hollywood as a vividly illustrated catalogue of astonishing smut.If Mad Max (a rare stateside success) is the only Down Under-and-dirty flick you remember, you missed out on a vital drive-in culture, one that Mark Hartley\\'s Not Quite Hollywood does a suitably supercharged job of chronicling.Not Quite Hollywood returns us to a time when the price of admission was cheap and the thrills even cheaper.Its shallowness is nonetheless in tune with its subject: the gory, violent, sex-crazed Australian exploitation films of the \\'70s and \\'80s.Cheerfully celebrates the energy and creativity of this subculture, and wants to rescue it from the toffee-nosed pundits who looked down on the genre.There is a remarkable story to be told of outlaws carving out their own slice of the industry with scant regard for decorum, personal safety or narrative coherence.The end product, while shallow and sometimes disconcertingly furtive, offers an enlightening, pleasurable peek into one of cinema\\'s more enticing dark corners.Aussie genre pics of the 1970s and \\'80s get a rip-roaring salute in Not Quite Hollywood.Hartley\\'s own film is much livelier than most of those he is out to celebrate -- partly because of its abundance of genuinely hair-raising behind-the-scenes footage. []The most ambitious work of its kind.Just take our advice and bring tissues. You\\'re going to need them.A slick account of ancient crevices in the human psyche rendered in cutting-edge cinematic style.A manipulative, tearjerking thriller that, functioning as a sustained, anguished primal scream, is as emotionally devastating as any film, fiction or non-, released this year.An undeniably shattering story, if forgivably shaky in its impassioned, therapeutic unfolding.Dear Zachary earns its right to engage us on a primal level, but it comes on the heels of so many films that don\\'t, movies that...prey on modern fears and inflate third-rate material to the plane of tragedy.A four-handkerchief documentary if there ever was one.It is impossible not to be fired up by Kurt Kuenne\\'s incendiary cri de coeur, Dear Zachary: A Letter to a Son About His Father.Dear Zachary\\'s emotional intimacy is its greatest strength, and enough to get it through sections that seem more manipulative than meaningful.A true-crime story so gripping, devastating, and ultimately unforgettable that it easily trumps any thriller Hollywood has to offer this year.The facts are so awful that Dear Zachary can be forgiven much of its antsiness -- as a memorial, as a condolence to Bagby\\'s parents (who became activists for judicial reform in their late son\\'s honor), and as a howl of grief.When Kuenne picked up his camera and set out to make a love letter to a tragically lost friend, he had no idea what he would find. With Dear Zachary, he found the best documentary of the year.What begins as a poignant tribute to filmmaker Kurt Kuenne\\'s dead best friend snowballs into a gut-wrenching true-crime story. A gorgeous, thoughtful film that is remarkably evenhanded in its treatment of the subject.One can see the hand of coproducer Terrence Malick in this gorgeous, lyrical documentary about ecological destruction in Austin, Texas.[][]The result is an expansive and ambivalent testament to human ingenuity, human intransigence, and nature\\'s endangered yet enduring power to move.By turns rapturously beautiful and unspeakably sad while considering the consequences of unchecked urban sprawl.Even if the director eventually hard-pedals her pantheist imagery into clich??, this inconvenient truth is discreet, intimate and regularly surprising.No one who sees this intriguing documentary will want to argue with reporter Greider when he forcefully insists, \"We need a more mature regard for the future.\" We do indeed.[Cinematographer] Daniel has never shot a film for Malick, though you\\'d hardly guess so, given The Unforeseen\\'s poetic and dreamy shots of nature that, like the images that open the Malick\\'s \"The Thin Red Line,\" hint at an Earthly paradise.The Unforeseen is a poetic and high-minded meditation on American developers\\' manifest destiny and the cancer it introduces into the natural world.As frustrating as it is welcome.An unusually poetic and meditative eco-themed documentary, Laura Dunn\\'s The Unforeseen is as beautiful as it is ultimately depressing.Though fittingly directed by Laura Dunn, one can\\'t help but feel the presence of producer Terrence Malick.The Unforeseen explores the rights of man, the death of nature, the water below, the air above and all that going, going, gone green in between.[]The movie wavers between Sundance-friendly issue film and spiritual reverie.Add The Unforeseen to the catalog of artfully produced nonfiction films that show how humans are screwing up the planet.The movie\\'s glacial pace and willingness to let its mind and eye wander that produces its spiritual and intellectual heft-not to mention its atypical visual splendor.A beautiful, soulful work about real estate development and sprawl, focused on Austin\\'s beloved Barton Springs, and if you think that\\'s impossible you haven\\'t seen it.The kind of transformative viewing experience that has made the current period a golden age for nonfiction film. [][]Even an average performance by the Rolling Stones isn\\'t boring.It\\'s hard to imagine, I know, but Shine A Light gives us the Rolling Stones in a fresh way.As a concert film it\\'s among the best: intimately shot, smoothly edited, endlessly involving.The effect was intense and overwhelming, but I mean that in a good way.At times, the cutting shifts from the hasty to the impatient to the borderline epileptic, and, while never doubting Scorsese\\'s ardor for the Stones, I got the distinct impression of a style in search of a subject.The genius of Scorsese\\'s film, which is being shown in IMAX in 93 theaters, is that it reveals the Stones\\' mortality while celebrating all that makes them more than mere mortals.It\\'s showbiz, after all. And the band still rocks like none other, true to their creed that if their adored blues masters can play into their dotage, then so can they.Close-ups detail the etched faces of the Stones, but they\\'ve never seemed more ageless. Their music and spirit are still brash and youthful.He brings all his skills as a filmmaker to the film, but Scorsese did not achieve the monumental dimensions of his movie from cinematic savoir faire. Shine a Light is huge because the Stones are giants.Scorsese captures the Stones at their ancient, un-ironic best, bluesy showmen who leave it all on the stage every night, never for a moment letting on that they\\'re playing, for the 10,000th time, 40-year-old hits.Amazingly, Jagger turns 65 in July. And although his face is carved with lines, his stage act hasn\\'t changed much since the band played Madison Square Garden nearly 40 years ago.The movie easily beats paying $250 to experience the Bones in person; you can see everything without having to stand up, and the sound at a multiplex is far better than any arena.Regardless of age, they can still rip this joint.The singer\\'s energy remains awe-inspiring: He flails his sinewy limbs around the stage like a man possessed, and there isn\\'t a single song in the show that he doesn\\'t invest himself in whole.The music\\'s insistent richness builds and builds, its sound becoming so deep and persuasive that qualms about age fade and the rhythms carry us away.What he has created, inadvertently, is an invaluable documentation of semi-fossilized Stones -- musicologists may like it, sociologists should love it and, some distant day, anthropologists will treasure it.This is how great rock and roll was meant to be filmed: By great filmmakers.There\\'s more than a bit of satisfaction to be had in Shine a Light, which starts with a clever tussle of the dynamic wills of Jagger and Scorsese. Through interviews with retired workers and faux interviews with scripted characters, Jia brings long-repressed history to life on an intimate scale.24 City belies its documentary origins with overtly poetic film language: the film is an elegiac visual symphony of carefully framed compositions, trompe l\\'oeil camera movements, posed portraits, internal rhymes and mysterious vignettes.A blend of documentary and drama which is by turns movingly authentic and deliberately artificial.24 City includes evocative footage of Factory 420\\'s dismantling, but emphasizes people over place.In [Jia Zhangke\\'s] chronicle of the changing fortunes of a defunct but once glorious aeronautic factory and its workers through talking heads and wordless images exclusively, the documentary strain prevails to simple, yet emotionally reverberating effect.Strongest moments are when the pristine HD lensing by Hong Kong\\'s Yu Lik-wai (a Jia regular) and Wang Yu, and warm string music by Yoshihiro Hanno, take over in montages showing the gradual dismantling of the factory.Zhangke never hints much about politics ... His is more the story of ordinary people caught up in history and still determined to live their lives as well as they can. It\\'s both relevant and resonant.History weaves in and out of faces that purl their monologues -- real or scripted -- as Jia presents the past as a giant, invisible river.A deeply serious and sombre film, trying to find a way of telling the stories of people affected by the gigantic political and economic changes sweeping that country whose concerns must in the end affect us all: 21st-century China.Enthralling, beguiling and haunting.Chinese arthouse fixture Jia Zhang Ke looks at the closure of a state-owned factory in Chengdu, combining real interviews with awkwardly am-dram mock ones.The film takes on an operatic feel, moving between euphoria for the new and lament for the lost.The director has an exquisite eye that keeps getting stronger and subtler. He trusts that beauty is vagueness\\'s alluring upside.24 City won\\'t change the minds of detractors -- it is his most painfully slow yet -- but it might change the minds of his supporters, including this critic, for Jia attempts something that is, in the end, unforgivable.The result is surprisingly engrossing -- even lively, due in part to brief musical numbers inserted amid the interviews.Mr. Jia is an artist, one of the most interesting filmmakers working anywhere in the world, and he made his film to bear witness to a way of life while witnesses could still be found.The actors in 24 City, an experimental fiction-nonfiction hybrid, bring their own existential realities to their short, touching performances.Mostly, 24 City falls into the same Jia trap of inadvertently drawing the viewers\\' gaze past his human subjects and to the poetic images of a country in painful metamorphosis.Jia is one of the guiding lights of the sixth generation of Chinese filmmakers, and 24 City is a potent exploration of his constant theme-the tectonic shifts that occur as the old gives way to the new.This subversively old-fashioned hymn to industrial production is filled with offbeat, vaguely absurd details. [][][]This solid doc reminds us how unsustainable the current American economy is.Unexpectedly entertaining, given that it\\'s about dodgy accounting on an epic scale, the film predicts an economic cold shower that is about to douse America\\'s prospects, thanks to its ever-expanding national debt.This movie is a scary, exhilarating blast of atheist common sense.Patrick Creadon\\'s film is a lucid history lesson in the failures of successive Republican presidents to put a stopper in the country\\'s leaking fiscal hole.Chastening, compelling.Not something your average cinemagoer wants to see but important information nonetheless. Let\\'s hope Obama is watching.A movie that should be seen by everyone.You will not likely forget the Jeremiad it presents about how the United States has been living on borrowed money -- and borrowed time -- for decades and now is presenting the bill for our extravagance to our grandchildren.This documentary manages to do something damn near impossible: make the subject of the U.S. national debt understandable and, moreover, render it interesting and urgent.I.O.U.S.A. is a clear, cogent and compelling primer on contemporary American economics and the not-so-small matter of how we ended up at the edge of a precipice.A documentary about the U.S. addiction to debt, I.O.U.S.A. could have easily taken the title of another movie released this week, What Just Happened?If this week\\'s headlines have failed to convince you that the United States is on the verge of an economic meltdown, Patrick Creadon\\'s scary new documentary, I.O.U.S.A., will demolish any lingering doubts.A sharp, absorbing portrait of our national debt crisis.this movie makes a devastating case for the consequence of our current \"rob Peter to pay Paul\" budgetary shell game.Though the filmmaking is playful at times, the film is essentially 90 percent message, 10 percent movie. Then again, sometimes a message is important enough to make other considerations seem irrelevant.Packed with facts, figures and the testimony of policy experts, the film is no wallow in wonkiness, but a surprisingly sprightly tough-love lesson in fiscal responsibility.Documentarian Patrick Creadon does a nice job of making the daunting math and economic theories associated with our national debt accessible. Gibney\\'s focus on Thompson at his most politically relevant is welcome, but it renders the broader picture less than complete, particularly when it comes to his early life influences.A definitive, accessible, even inspiring screen biography put together with thought and vitality.The film\\'s plea that we need Thompson now more than ever is a little misty-eyed: Thompson\\'s day was long gone by the time he put a gun to his head.Gonzo is much more than a tribute to a maverick and genuine pioneer. It\\'s a lament for the gaping hole that Thompson left behind. The only obvious weakness is Gibney\\'s reluctance to engage fully with Thompson\\'s toxic personal life.This documentary about his life by Alex Gibney, though entertaining in many ways, is oddly uninterested in his strengths or otherwise as a writer, the very gift for which Thompson earnestly wished to be known.Thompson must be looking down, or up, from his afterworld thinking: \"The worst success is a failure to keep alive the spirit of offendedness and outrage.\"This soft-headed hagiography is a disappointment, and at least half an hour too long.This portrait rightly invites admiration for the man\\'s influential talent, while provoking thoughts about the responsibilities of journalism. It\\'s overlong but colourful anecdotes and a zippy 1960s/1970s soundtrack make it entertaining stuff.Gibney says the film took so much out of him that he limped into the Sundance Festival with a ruptured disc, a green liver and spots in his eyes that will not disappear. I hope he now thinks it worth the trouble. I\\'m pretty sure watchers will.Gonzo is an excellent reminder that Thompson was more than just a wild man. He was, at least for a time, a first-rate writer who covered his times and helped shape them.The worshipfulness obscures the sadder aspects of Thompson\\'s life, which is perhaps why Gibney focuses on the writer\\'s 1965-75 golden years.But Gibney wisely tells much of the story in Thompson\\'s own words, narrated by actor Johnny Depp, who played the writer in the movie version of \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.\"Too much time in this overly long film is spent on minutiae.Filmmaker Alex Gibney had access to those who knew the guy, the famous, the infamous and the obscure, and he paints a picture of a serious journalist who saw himself documenting \\'the death of the American Dream.\\'Though Thompson\\'s long slide into irrelevance in the 80s and 90s is duly noted, most of the movie covers his glory days during the Vietnam era, when he was arguably the most exciting and important literary talent in America.Gonzo director Gibney frees himself from the heady topicality of his recent documentaries...and dives right down into the deep -- and dark -- end.[Director] Gibney assembles a wealth of Thompson memorabilia and first-person interviews for this often insightful and sometimes overly indulgent chronicle.An amused and affectionate look at the writer who formed a crucial link between the New Journalism of the 1960s and today\\'s blogosphere.At its worst, the film takes a long detour into Thompson\\'s admiration for an utterly banal 1974 Carter speech (The Powerful were sticking it to The People again) as a way to make us feel virtuous, political and leftish.Neatly balancing full-hearted celebration with evenhanded examination. He claims here to have been influenced early on by Snow White. I should have thought Peter Pan instead.[][]Some might confuse Zenovich\\'s indictment on the judge as a cop-out in judging Polanski. But the facts remain. There\\'s no further insight into the heinous crime. Nor is there a new judgment to be passed on the man who committed it. Anyone looking for new rThough Marina Zenovich\\'s film deals with the notorious case of the film director who pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old, the film\\'s real subject is the California legal system turned upside down by celebrity and media pressure.With a subject like Roman Polanski, you don\\'t really need to do much to capture audience interest. But maybe that\\'s the reason Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired doesn\\'t live up to its promise.Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired, a documentary by Marina Zenovich that is also a first-rate work of reportage, makes a forceful case that the whole truth of the matter was never heard in court and Polanski was more sinned against than sinning.Roman Polanski (The Pianist, Rosemary\\'s Baby, Chinatown) is unquestionably a great filmmaker, but as Marina Zenovich\\'s documentary Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired perhaps unintentionally demonstrates, he\\'s also a creep.Whether you can swallow that or not, the mesmerizing narrative recounts a media circus of unrivaled malignance.She has achieved extraordinary access to the other still-living players in the case, and they all seem to be in agreement: Polanski is correct in saying the judge played with him as a cat might play with a mouse.This is a superb picture, sharp, open-minded, wised-up and cinematically accomplished. I wonder if any man could\\'ve handled the Polanski enigma with the same ironic intelligence [Marina] Zenovich has.As an anatomy not only of Polanski\\'s psyche but also of the legal system he confronted, it\\'s as baroquely compelling as The Dark Knight.A clever, contemplative kind of courtroom drama that utilizes the best of Hollywood filmmaking style to tell a story so strange, it must be true.This is more about the culture of celebrity, the sensationalism, a power hungry, media-hungry judge, and all the things that have happened since then. And as such, it\\'s a very good documentary.Using tons of footage and new interviews with the victim and key legal figures -- but not the subject himself -- director Marina Zenovich shows how Polanski\\'s darker urges were matched on a moral level by others involved in the case.In contenting itself with the changing public perception of a long-misunderstood event, Wanted And Desired is compelling enough.Zenovich\\'s zeal exceeds her grasp.Its indictment ultimately feels like a secondary issue to Polanski\\'s apparently incontrovertible guilt, which makes him--in this instance--still more victimizer than victim.This deft and subtle film is a fitting tribute to a man -- like him or not -- whose life deserves more than tabloid headlines.A subtly intelligent and sharply argued documentary. []Chicago 10 is that nearly perfect marriage of style -- edgy, different -- to documentary subject: 1968, that seminal year so celebrated in 2008 for changing the America that came after it.A documentary that somehow manages to capture the anarchic spirit of those topsy-turvy times without devolving into anarchy itself.Makes skillful use of documentary footage to relate what happened in the streets of Chicago, culminating in what was routinely described at the time as \\'a police riot.\\'A vibrant, unconventional documentary about the conspiracy trial of the so-called inciters of the riots that occurred during the 1968 Democratic National Convention.The material is incredibly compelling -- though trust me, it was even more compelling (and scary) as it was happening.If nothing else, it\\'s a welcomed alternative to the more straightforward and serious film that Spielberg is likely to deliver.Given the filmmaker\\'s privileged perspective of hindsight, to notconsider the real-world repercussions of their theater, to not connect the dots between 1968 and 2008 is a squandered opportunity.It\\'s a fresh and important new take on one of the most tumultuous periods in American history.As a peace-loving liberal, cross-examining Morgen\\'s rousing, worthy, but slanted film is as fun as kicking yourself in the shins (or watching Clinton tear into Obama)A cacophony of sights and sounds and a disjointed narrative dilute the message.In the end, the truest thing that can be said for Chicago 10 is that, though Morgen did just about everything he could to make his movie unwatchable, the story was interesting enough to fight him to a draw.In eschewing the use of a narrator or talking heads, Morgen leaves out too much crucial information.A provocative reflection of its rule-breaking subjects, Brett Morgen\\'s political documentary re-examines the past while drawing unmissable parallels to the present.The director wants to bring recent history to life for people who weren\\'t around to witness it, and in that he succeeds pretty admirably.Worth seeing for the expert archival selections, but a decidedly mixed bag for anyone familiar, or unfamiliar, with the times.The movie dazzles us into self-examination.An electrifying picture.Chicago 10, Brett Morgen\\'s semi-animated, semi-documentary attempt to make the \\'60s cool for a new generation of kids, does the opposite.As an activist documentary with a contemporary agenda, it doesn\\'t pretend to be \"objective\" (whatever that means), but to find inspiration in the passion and irreverence of its heroes. The film\\'s bloody dramatizations...suggest a fundamental distrust of the efficacy of the word over the image and a bland assumption that audiences have lost their ability to empathize.For American military personnel to descend to Saddam\\'s level was one of the worst moments in US history, and Morris\\'s film reveals the truth: the poisonous Abu Ghraib pictures were not merely an American scandal but a human catastrophe.[]Standard Operating Procedure is a brilliantly, almost self-consciously, stylish film.In taking us beyond the edges of those infamous photographs, he shows us a system that did more than produce a few bad apples; it was rotten to the core.Morris offers valuable new perspectives on Abu Ghraib, but the paying customers may not care to go there again.Standard Operating Procedure feels like a historical work in progress, brilliant, thought-provoking but incomplete.As unappetizing as the subject may seem, Errol Morris\\' Standard Operating Procedure exerts a hypnotic pull anyway.Truth is a matter of perspective in director Errol Morris\\' Standard Operating Procedure, a piercing look at the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison and the aftermath of their discovery.[Director] Morris examines the atrocity of Abu Ghraib and the notorious photographs which have come to signify all the tortured secrets contained within that Iraqi prison\\'s walls.The result is a devastating film, and an important one.Probes deeper than any other Iraq war documentary.Standard Operating Procedure encourages us not to judge but to try to understand. Or, barring that impossibility, it prods us like the finest documentaries to watch and listen.Morris marshals the witnesses, demonstrates that photographs are unreliable evidence, and leaves a verdict to the audience.Morris explores the reality of Abu Ghraib with a visceral intensity that straightforward reportage could never allow.What\\'s epic in Morris\\' still and haunting assembly of talking heads is an indictment of photography, and by extension, history.Morris widens our understanding of the real crimes that took place there. This is where the movie becomes not just a slant on history but also a vehicle for broadening our understanding.Sometimes painful to watch, but a movie that must be seen.The singular achievement of SOP is reminding us that truth is always a slippery construct, made all the more so by the fallible human mind and the ever-blinking eye.Focus is really the heart of Morris\\' unsettling film, which strikes a remarkable balance between art and disturbance, between beauty and pain. [][]Problems are addressed in a narrative progression that gets more horrendous and builds into utter despair, except for the final few words of activism and optimism.[]All of Salina\\'s interviews and data tell a graphic story about corporate water piracy, the complicity of governments, the burden put on the poor and the scam of bottled water. But she can\\'t quite jam it all in and still have a film that, well, flows.As if we didn\\'t have enough to worry about.Salina\\'s film might have been stronger had it not tried to cover so many water-related issues. But there\\'s no denying its power.Flow is the kind of terrifying, impending-apocalypse documentary none of us wants to watch but all of us probably should; it isn\\'t the most enjoyable experience you\\'ll have at the movies this year, but I wouldn\\'t doubt if it\\'s one of the most eye-opening.Flow makes the case against the privatization of water, which is happening in gazillions of impoverished communities around the world, not to mention North American backyards.When filmmaker Irena Salina does marshal the facts, Flow is an eye-opening, troubling 90 minutes that makes us think twice about an element we take for granted.Salina\\'s film is a very effective primer of an underreported problem. If nothing else, it made me thirsty.Offers up a call-to-arms against bottled water conglomerates that, in its structural sloppiness, feels like a high school student\\'s tossed-off research paper.I have already stopping buying a bottle a day to bring to the office.Irena Salina\\'s astonishingly wide-ranging film is less depressing than galvanizing, an informed and heartfelt examination of the tug of war between public health and private interests.This documentary finds a good balance between terrifying statistics, depressing images, talking heads, and hopeful suggestions.Touching on everything from the cost citizens of poor countries pay for water to corporate hoodwinking in the bottled-water business, Flow makes you thirsty for more informationGrim but ultimately hopeful, Flow makes a convincing, impassioned case that concerned citizens need to fight for the right to clean water just as assiduously as Yauch and his Beastie compatriots once demanded the right to party.One of those charming little documentaries that make you question whether the human race is really worth preserving.It\\'s a plainly one-sided call to arms, but with good reason -- you may never look at your faucet without flinching again.The inconvenient truth at the center of Flow: For Love of Water is that while the oil crisis is intensely debated and documented, disasters involving an even more essential fluid go perilously unnoticed. [][][]Whatever you think of the film, Body of War stirs up real admiration for its subject.[Tomas Young] deserves better treatment from the government than he\\'s gotten as a returning veteran, and a better movie than this simpleminded indictment of every senator who voted \\'yea.\\'Body of War again demonstrates that we Americans still have some bitter truths to face.It is not merely an antiwar document, but a complex profile in courage of a paraplegic and patriot.Body of War makes no bones about its activism. Then again, like the others, it\\'s the willingness to contextualize events and apply reason to them that makes it and others so valuable.A tough, affecting documentary about an American soldier in the Iraq war.A chance to witness the struggles of a remarkable young man. Young may be paralyzed in the body, but his mind is fiercely alive.Editor Bernadine Colish weaves together all that C-SPAN footage into a disturbing procedural indictment.What makes Body Of War such a powerful documentary isn\\'t the clever rhetorical device of debate vs. reality, but the way it documents American life in the \\'00s.Lazy, shallow and repetitive, Phil Donahue\\'s Body of War is one of the most incompetent documentaries to emerge from the Iraq war.Drenched in emotion and suffused with good intentions, Body of War is impossible not to like, but difficult to admire.[]Body of War is a gut-wrenching documentary experience.Architecturally sound, emotionally ravaging.Makes for a good anti-war doc, to be sure, but an even finer -- and painfully accurate -- portrait of the former soldier as a young man.A powerful argument against impetuous decisions, be they to join the military or to attack a country. [][][]While it\\'s undoubtedly comical and touching, a pall of middle-aged gloom hovers over the antics of Canada\\'s longest surviving death metal band.The music, heard in economical proportions, is secondary to the unexpectedly deep bond between its creators. Their story is an underdog\\'s triumph that\\'s difficult to deny.See Anvil! if you love heavy metal, because these guys are legends. See Anvil! if you don\\'t love heavy metal because this story is legendary.This Is Spinal Tap was a mockumentary, but this is for real, a portrait of a band that was very influential on later metal bands, like Metallica, but who found the big time elusive.Anvil! The Story of Anvil is overflowing with honesty. It is fair to say that it is to metal what The Wrestler is to wrestling. It is brutal but, in a way, triumphant.A winning and surprisingly moving documentary about -- wait for it -- a struggling Canadian heavy metal band that apparently influenced a generation of hard-rockers including Metallica, Anthrax and Guns N\\' Roses.Cute if predictable.Now THIS is Spinal Tap.The new documentary Anvil! The Story of Anvil succeeds every which way, as \\'80s metal nostalgia, as a twisted sort of reality-show attempt at a comeback, as an unexpectedly touching portrait of a friendship.Gervasi has tapped into a powerful if much-overlooked truth: humanity rocks.An engaging account of the life and times of an obscure Canadian heavy-metal band.A study in the cost of pursuing a dream that\\'s probably the wrong dream, Anvil! The Story of Anvil looks for the high notes but doesn\\'t -- or can\\'t -- shy away from the lows.Anvil! The Story of Anvil is a very funny documentary, following original band members Steve \"Lips\" Kudlow and Robb Reiner (seriously), on a disastrous European tour and an attempt at a comeback album.Anvil! The Story of Anvil can\\'t help but evoke This Is Spinal Tap, the classic 1984 mockumentary directed by the other Rob Reiner, in terms of both sheer hair-metal ludicrousness and indignities suffered by a not-so-successful rock band on the road.Anvil! The Story of Anvil is a documentary about the moderate rise and long, long fall of their band, where musicians in the two other slots came and went, but Lips and Robb rocked on.There\\'s just something utterly winning about the way the guys of Anvil hang on to their dream -- and when, in the movie\\'s final scenes, they find it for a moment, it creates some genuine, headbanging joy.Anvil! is one of the sweetest, funniest films I\\'ve seen this year. Also the loudest and most foulmouthed. While its style and structure conform to the well-worn template established by docs like Spellbound, its success lies in creating an accessible, fun way into serious issues.One of the more surreal docs to come down the pike in some time.Of all the films to come out of the conflict, Afghan Star is the most provocative, because its message that people are essentially the same is a dubious, double-edge sword.It\\'s hard not to look at the effect this program is having on the country and not come away thinking military might isn\\'t the solution a lot of those in power would like us to believe it is.Like The Kite Runner novel and movie, the documentary Afghan Star succeeds at dramatizing the lives of Afghans, but those we see on screen are real flesh-and-blood characters -- people who let their true feelings emerge.An informative documentary revealing how decades of war and years of Taliban repression have fallen to the wayside, however briefly, as Kabul\\'s answer to American Idol seduces a violence-weary Afghanistan.One of the most hopeful and heart-rending movies I\\'ve seen this year.This eye-opening film reveals that even systems as dubious as the Idol format mean dramatically different things when transferred to radically dissimilar cultures.Havana Marking\\'s excellent, illuminating film follows four Afghan Star finalists over the frenetic final months leading to the Moment of Truth.In its vivid, suspenseful depiction of a high-stakes competition for prize money and the honor of being named Afghanistan\\'s top singer, Afghan Star goes much deeper.Afghan Star reveals that the Afghan people strongly crave to make up for years lost to Taliban repression and catch up with the 21st century.If you think American Idol is a cultural phenomenon here, imagine its impact on a country devastated by 30 years of internal strife, religious intolerance, civil war and foreign invasion.This is about an Afghan culture that is at a real turning point.British filmmaker Havana Marking\\'s entertaining first feature documentary.Fascinating and, when you see Afghan versions of Simon Cowell and Co. reacting to tryouts, a reminder of how fame and the thirst for it is the same in any language.The movie uses the talent show Afghan Star as a prism through which to examine the fragmented tribal culture of Afghanistan as reflected in the backgrounds of four finalists (two of them women) and the public responses to their performances.[]If nothing else, Afghan Star offers a reminder of how much has changed in Afghanistan from the late \\'70s -- when Kabul was a secular-oriented city with co-ed universities and a thriving nightclub scene -- to the rise of the Taliban.If you think it\\'s impossible to underestimate the cultural significance of American Idol, go see British filmmaker Havana Marking\\'s documentary about its Afghani imitator.Although sadly rife with gut-clenching moments as those, Afghan Star is most thrilling when depicting the show\\'s delicately balanced effort to bring Afghans together despite their fractious ethnic and clan boundaries. [][]The Cove does what every great documentary with a cause should: It educates, entertains, and inspires audiences to take action.Restrained and harrowing.A taut, thrilling documentary that plays out like a heist movie while never overshadowing its message or activist credentials.There\\'s an effective thriller element to this vividly assembled doc.The great strength of this documentary about the covert killing of wild dolphins in Japan is its aesthetic: artful edits, zippy music, even a few jokes. Radical stuff for an eco-documentary.One would imagine, and hope, that an Oscar nomination beckons.Facts, stats and grim archive footage help build up a convincing if one-sided case, but it is the film\\'s revelatory covert recording that encapsulates the true power of documentary cinema.By any measure, this is a horror film: graphic, shocking, uncompromising. The horrors, moreover, are real: the annual slaughter of thousands of dolphins in a secluded cove in Japan, where they are trapped in nets and hacked and speared to death.The Cove is guerrilla journalism at its best. Structured and paced by director Louie Psihoyos as a thriller/caper movie, it brings audience-grabbing cinematic conventions to work in telling its story of dolphin genocideIn effect, by looking at nature The Cove shows us what it means to be human.It is put together so smartly you can almost feel the urgency - from the patient set-up, which lays on the information and statistics without getting boring or too preachy, to the horrific finale.It is overwhelming, compelling and very depressing. In short, The Cove does its job very, very well.As the subject of a documentary, this grim enterprise distinctly lacks the warm and fuzzy appeal of The March of the Penguins. So director Louie Psihoyos ingeniously reinvents his film as a spy caper.There are five minutes in this documentary that ought to be mandatory viewing. The entire 90 minutes is utterly compelling, but the five alone are worth the price of admission.The film is paced like a thriller, written as an expose and intended as a call to arms for ecologists, animal lovers and moviegoers around the world.Psihoyos and his team got the footage they were after -- thanks to meticulous planning, lots of furtive sneaking around and the judicious placement of underwater microphones and cameras disguised as rocks.Beyond the high-stakes game of cat and mouse, the film explores the mysterious relationship between humans and dolphins and the unexplainable connection between our two species.Directed by Louie Psihoyos, this well-intentioned documentary exposes the harvesting of dolphins by Japanese fishermen, yet its theatrics suggest a cross between reality TV and Mission: Impossible. Though the tale of these wry, hard-bitten lives is told with neither music nor a narrating voice, the final effect is not to numb or confound the viewer but, rather, to cast a spell.Strange to relate that one of the year\\'s most striking cinematic experiences so far is a documentary starring 3,000 sheep.[The directors] portray something indelible by capturing the rancher\\'s old-hand ways.A tenaciously observed and a quietly absorbing ethnography about a pair of shepherds leading some 3,000 sheep on a 150-mile journey up into Montana\\'s Absaroka-Beartooth Mountains for summer pasture.The images, including sheep on the move up near vertical hills, are remarkable, the landscape spectacular, the unsentimental account of back-breaking, backside-aching work impressive.This beautiful and hypnotic documentary shows the agony and the ecstasy of herding sheep up into Montana\\'s Beartooth mountains for the summer pasture.It would be foolish not to experience this film.I have no doubt that, come the end of the year, Sweetgrass will be on the \"10 Best\" lists. It is that memorable for pictorial, cultural and even moral reasons.Sweetgrass is probably the definition of niche, but one dedicated to some of the highest ideals of film: it brings us information from a place we\\'ve never been, and with a rapturous innocence.If there\\'s anything we can learn from the creatures here, it\\'s that any day in which you don\\'t get stripped of your coat or eaten by a bear is probably a good one.There are audience rewards for sticking with the herd and its lonesome cowboys.Even viewers caught unaware of just how natural this documentary is could easily find themselves mesmerized by its unique charms.Sweetgrass\\' unbroken shots of often-repetitive activity have a beguiling quality to them, their very monotony encouraging a deeper absorption and reflection, but hard facts aren\\'t easy to come by.Instead of rounding up information, this documentary about an arduous sheep drive across Montana is driven by the beauty of the landscape.It\\'s a gorgeous and, believe it or not, riveting documentary...about sheep.It may not be your thing, but Sweetgrass is unlike anything you\\'ll see in a theater this year. It bravely strays from the flock.If you\\'re used to the ADD pace of modern filmmaking, Sweetgrass will probably drive you crazy. If you can adjust, it could widen your soul.Sweetgrass is an unexpectedly intoxicating documentary, unexpected because it blends high artistic standards with the grueling reality of one of the toughest, most exhausting of work environments.In an extraordinary series of tableaux that are alternately idyllic and severe, Sweetgrass defies the conventions of what most of us regard as a documentary film.What starts out looking like a 4H film soon develops narrative power, and a rough natural humor. You\\'ll be hearing bleating in your sleep for days, which is more pleasant than it sounds. This is the kind of muckraking we should see more often.This solidly constructed documentary aims to do for food production what An Inconvenient Truth did for global warming.Concerned with entertainment value as well as clarity and punch, he uses lots of colourful graphics, and moves quickly from one aspect of his subject to another.Overused narration treats the audience like the cattle being abused on screen; a continuous score rams the message home, just in case we missed the point...Compelling, entertaining and illuminating documentary which makes you think twice, and then a few more times, about eating anything at all in U.S.Smart, gripping, and untainted by the influence of Michael Moore.After you see what IBP is doing to cattle, what Tyson is doing to chickens, what farmers are doing to us and what Monsanto is doing to farmers in the new documentary Food, Inc., you may never eat again.A mind-boggling, heart-rending, stomach-churning expose on the food industry.If you are what you eat, we are mostly genetically modified, poorly regulated, unhealthy meat byproducts generating profits for a few gargantuan corporations.In exposing the unsavory practices of agribusiness, the muckraking documentary Food, Inc. cuts to the bone.An angry blast of disgust aimed at the American food industry.Illuminating and occasionally revolting.A riveting if distressing look at the essentially unregulated American food supply.If you\\'re planning on seeing Food, Inc. as a date movie, make sure you have dinner beforehand.The result is an alarming film that tackles food and freedom-of-speech issues on many fronts.This absorbing film looks terrific and does a superb job of making its case that our current food ways are drastically out of whack.An invaluable primer, Food, Inc. covers a wide array of factors and concerns without becoming excessively polemical or deadeningly earnest.The whole thing is as subtle as a watermelon in a bowl of Cheerios but necessary, nonetheless.If Wal-Mart, the Lucifer of multinational corporations in many liberal eyes, sees the fiscal sense in stocking an increasingly wide array of organic foodstuffs, consumer habits truly are changing.It\\'s not a pretty picture. But Food, Inc. is an essential one. Mr Rock is one proud, if heartbroken, daddy and also a lovely, free-wheeling guide through African-American, Afro-hating hair culture.A slipshod doc about a fascinating subject.It\\'s an eye-opener, if a blatantly chauvinistic one: Rock\\'s main beefs seem to be that men have to pay for it, and upkeep of such a coveted accessory is a barrier to intimacy in the bedroom.All Christopher Guest-allusions aside, this is a crucial documentary about race and gender today.Despite dozens of interviews and Rock\\'s personal agenda, this isn\\'t the hard-hitting expose it should have been.Rock fronts this informative rummage through the $9 billion US black hair industry in a style much like his stand-up comedy: hilarious, insightful and charming enough to let him get away with the flammable stuff.It\\'s just about sharp and funny enough to make you wish it was a bit sharper and funnier.Full of sweetly sardonic observations, the docu-comedy is one of the funniest movies of the year.Rock sheds new light on this old story through a poignant mix of interviews, investigation and his trademark satire.Hair is personal. It\\'s also political.It\\'s funny, clever and marginally educational. You can tell your friends you went to a documentary without having felt as if you saw one.It\\'s rich food for thought, though you wonder why little attention is given to the idea that perhaps some women relax their hair because it\\'s easier to style that way, or that elaborate attention to hair is hardly exclusive to black women.If you arrive at Good Hair never having thought about the complexities of black hair, bring a notebook. If you are a black woman wearing a weave, bring a tissue.Good Hair is certainly no arid anthropological study. Rock\\'s queries are loose and quippy, but his instincts are as sharp as an investigative journalist\\'s.Rock takes aim at the truth and humor of this potent cultural question with a sharp wit and lively curiousity, even if he doesn\\'t pursue vigorously enough its uglier side.Some of this, a lot of this, is preaching to the choir. But it\\'s still pretty compelling no matter what perspective you\\'re coming from.Scattered as it sometimes seems, Good Hair is a real eye-opener...Good Hair, directed by longtime Rock collaborator Jeff Stilson, is such a rollicking, thoroughly entertaining ride that it\\'s easy to take for granted just how easy Rock makes it look.This entertaining exploration of black hair issues will get your dander up.The film succeeds as a vehicle for Rock\\'s personality. It\\'s a bit surprising that a documentary with such an unwieldy title offers such a streamlined and resonant account of history.For those who know the story, Most Dangerous Man puts it in fresh perspective. If you don\\'t, there\\'s probably not a better way to discover it.For those who lived through the turmoil of Vietnam, and for the generations that have come since, the film is an important document in its own right.The film is also an exciting cloak-and-dagger thriller.Ehrlich and Goldsmith carve out their own little place in the canon by focusing on the ethical journey of one man who refused to shrug off his own responsibility for the war and atoned for it with a seismic act of civil disobedience.The lessons of The Most Dangerous Man in America are not merely about war, they are about life and human behavior.It is a skillful, well-made film, although, since Ellsberg is the narrator, it doesn\\'t probe him very deeply. We see his version of himself.If you lived through it, you\\'ll be fascinated. If not, it still does a skillful job of creating a convincing and even suspenseful narrative from this history.Efficiently wedding archival footage to contemporary interviews, co-directors Judith Ehrlich and Rick Goldsmith take a chronological approach to Ellsberg\\'s journey of courage.In another time and culture, a story on this scale would deserve an opera.It pulses with the suspense and momentum of a sleek thriller -- a wily caper flick that just happens to revolve around one of the most crucial chapters in recent American history.This is meaty, dramatic stuff - see this movie with your teenagers and watch their jaws hit the floor -- and the filmmakers cannily use President Nixon\\'s secret tapes to bolster their case...Fortunately, the staunchly committed and controversial Ellsberg, now 78, is still around to tell his history-making tale, and he lends the film gravitas as both its persuasive narrator and primary talking head.This straightforward history lesson casts Daniel Ellsberg and his leaked Pentagon Papers as the first shot in the war that brought down the Nixon regime.Dangerous Man does a serviceable job of mapping out the particulars of his struggle, but the definitive cinematic version of his too-strange-for-fiction story has yet to be made.His \"treason\" gave credence to ending the war, helped push a corrupt administration toward its ruin and underlined the importance of the First Amendment. Rickety doc or not, Ellsberg deserves every ounce of hero worship he gets here.It\\'s a professional job, standing above the crowd of politico documentaries that proliferate like kudzu over arthouse screens.This detailed, clearly told and persuasive film is about Daniel Ellsberg, the man who leaked the secret history of the Vietnam War, known as the Pentagon Papers, to newspapers.Chooses not to follow the money but one man\\'s evolution in the pursuit of principle.So many people risked their livelihoods to put the 7,000-page Pentagon Papers out there -- although its most tangible result was the creation of Nixon\\'s plumbers unit. We have not celebrated Daniel Ellsberg enough. Let\\'s begin. []Not exactly genre-bending innovation or anything but a decent documentary about an important episode in history of oil company exploitation.A bleak, necessarily incomplete tale, and suffers from a late intrusion by celebrity eco-botherer Trudi Styler. But with this gripping, angry film, Berlinger has put himself back on the side of the angels.Although the real-life outcome may be known to some, Crude still, at its best, unfolds like a courtroom thriller.The Ecuadorians\\' fight continues, and their courage isn\\'t to be doubted. Even the much-mocked, much-maligned campaigner Trudie Styler emerges with credit for supporting them.Structurally a little jumbled, it\\'s still a worthy addition to the angry eco-doc subgenre.Gripping and powerful, Crude is documentary journalism as it needs to be. Blissful ignorance stirred with bland apathy is no longer an option.Few of these films ever take solid, substantive slices of truth or attestation from both sides. They are always partial, which vitiates the eagerness with which we would, if we could, espouse the cause of downtrodden.Joe Berlinger\\'s film is a suitably forensic dissection of an ecological disaster and much less of a crusading piece of polemic than documentaries such as An Inconvenient Truth.The arguments are batted back and forth, and one\\'s sympathy for the Ecuadorean side takes only a slight wobble when Trudi Styler gets behind the cause.An engrossing case for justice.A gripping, multifaceted thriller about media politics, global economics, and legal infighting. Wherever your sympathies fall, this may teach you a lot about the way the modern world works.One has to wonder if oil industry executives are concerned about the release of Joe Berlinger\\'s damning documentary.What Crude does best is take us behind the scenes and show in often candid detail how campaigns are waged, tactics decided on and strategies prioritized.As the film very eloquently implies, when the greater good is defined as profits, and a lack of culpability is proportionate to your number of shareholders, well . . . a lot of petroleum-soaked chickens will be coming home to roost.At first Crude looks like one more environmental agit-doc intended to outrage and inspire. Director Joe Berlinger is no doctrinaire hack, though.If you ever had doubts about the impact that celebrities can have on such a David-and-Goliath struggle, Berlinger methodically removes them.It\\'s a David-and-Goliath tale, full of anger and disturbing accusation, but it\\'s also inspiring.A legal thriller, it\\'s a three-year investigation into the disaster environmentalists call the \"Amazonian Chernobyl\" that offers both sides of the story and leaves the viewer in the position of jury.It will certainly remain in your mind the next time you stop for gas. [][]The footage is spectacular, the colors electric, the life aquatic trippier than anything you\\'ll see in even the most wildly imaginative animated fare.Strictly fodder for the preteen set, Under the Sea 3D, the latest IMAX deep-sea-dive exploration (brought to you by the fisheye\\'s point of view), is expectedly rudimentary but a splendor to watch.It\\'s impossible not to be wowed by some of the images in Under the Sea 3D, ?√á¬øthe coolest of which are a nice ?√á¬øreminder that, even in the age of CG wizardry, the best special effects still come straight from Mother Nature.Under the Sea 3D is a beautiful reminder that movies can take us to places we\\'ve never been before. There are still worlds to conquer out there that don\\'t require the gussying up of CGI effects to hold our attention.Even about halfway in, even having settled into your seat with those plastic glasses nestled on your nose, you\\'ll still find yourself dazzled again and again by the impossibly breathtaking beauty of the IMAX adventure Under the Sea 3D.The plot may not be much -- amazing creatures live in the sea and if we keep polluting the world a bunch of them will die, so let\\'s stop being such jerks -- but the visuals are absolutely fantastic.If you\\'re not taking the family on an exotic beach vacation anytime soon, consider this a reasonable alternative.The 3-D effects are uncanny; much of the audience ducked when sea snakes lunged at it. You can\\'t get that on your TV set. Yet.Oceanic movies in actual science museums are far more interesting and nuanced than this documentary -- not to mention the wildly popular Planet Earth series, which even in 2-D looks better.As intimate and enjoyable as anything Imax has done in 3-D.This is the fourth Imax underwater excursion, and the second in 3-D, and it may just be the best yet.Under the Sea 3D is one of the best of the genre. If it doesn\\'t serve oysters, per se, this submarine wonder offers marvels in abundance.The images are impressive, and include shots of some cuttlefish \\'hey-hey\\' cleverly set to the song Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps (the theme song for the Britcom Coupling).No computer-designed animatronic invention can begin to match the beauty and grace of the oceanic life photographed in Under the Sea 3D.This is a raw, brutal arena of cold-eyed predators chomping the weakest and inexpressibly ugly beings that have evolved so as to be disturbingly well camouflaged, utterly invisible until they make a deadly lunge at some poor vulnerable little fishy.One of the most fun and engaging IMAX movies to date.Here to inspire awe and depression with a vast universe of marine life that, barring possible ecological disaster, will be here eons after we\\'re gone.After 40 minutes behind 3-D glasses watching rare aquatic creatures, why bother with airline tickets and scuba gear? Every Little Step, like A Chorus Line itself, should prove catnip for any self-respecting, self-flagellating actor-dancer.There\\'s a terribly interesting story behind the creation of the musical phenom A Chorus Line, but don\\'t look to this confused and often self-congratulatory documentary to tell it.It\\'s all up there on the screen in this impassioned, exhilarating documentary. They want to dance for you. It\\'s what they did for love.All the dancers who move towards the final cut are so good that the line between success and failure seems cruelly arbitrary and the disappointment of those who don\\'t make it is acute. But nobody\\'s giving up.There are still plenty of engrossing aspects to the film, moments in the audition process that demonstrate the complexity of performance.I was thrilled and moved by Every Little Step, despite the abundance of bad dancing pouring out of reality television these days, because it\\'s about the real thing, and offers marvellous insights into of the process of creating a Broadway hit.A riveting documentary from James D. Stern and Adam Del Deo.Every Little Step never rises above being a very good showbiz documentary. But it\\'s an engaging tribute to a groundbreaking musical.Every Little Step is a terrific documentary history lesson about how Michael Bennett rounded up a bunch of New York singing, acting dancers, interviewed them and found out what they \\'did for love,\\' back in January of 1974.You can\\'t judge A Chorus Line by its film version; it\\'s one of the lousiest movie musicals ever. But you can assess the stage original\\'s influence by the wonderful new documentary Every Little Step.Fans of choreographer Michael Bennett\\'s blockbuster, which broke new ground when it opened in 1975, will find much to love here.Every Little Step is an uncommonly tender and observant documentary.Every Little Step is a feat of editing and sound design.Some of the documentary\\'s best moments capture the expressions of Avian and his assistants as they are caught unawares by an unexpectedly powerful audition.It instills an appreciation for the tremendous amount of work and passion that the performers put into their craft.A moving, passionate tribute to determination and heart, whatever you might choose to do in your life.The exuberant documentary Every Little Step revisits the genesis of the landmark show about the gestation and delivery of a Broadway musical.Their history of the show, studded with clips from Bennett\\'s original audiotapes, adds a fascinating subtext: in chronicling Broadway, A Chorus Line changed it forever.We should be kneeling on concrete to remind ourselves what dues these artists pay.The film is as much about the creation of the original show back in 1975 and the genius of the late Michael Bennett, who masterminded it, as it is about the newer version. [][]It is only in the sequence about Berg\\'s popular costar Philip Loeb that Aviva Kempner\\'s documentary resonates.Yoo-Hoo suggests that, yes, Berg broke new ground and, no, she shouldn\\'t be forgotten. But it doesn\\'t explain why she endured, or why she is so forgotten today.Charming.History has been unfair to Berg, a fact that filmmaker Aviva Kempner hopes to correct with this illuminating documentary.Kempner marshals an impressive lineup of both Berg and Goldberg fans to underscore the irrefutable significance of her subject.We\\'re left with an impression of a vivacious pioneer; but warm shouldn\\'t have to mean fuzzy.In Yoo Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg, Kempner gives us a balance of artist and alter ego, introducing us to a woman we\\'d like to know even better.In her latest film, Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg, [director Aviva] Kempner once again educates and entertains with unexpected tidbits and just plain good old-fashioned filmmaking.The documentary, like the series, is haimish in the extreme - cozy, warm, homey. It touches on such larger issues as feminism, acculturation, suburbanization, and the blacklist.Kempner has a real gift for making these almost-forgotten lives fascinating and vital.Born Tillie Edelstein, Berg honed her talent writing skits at her father\\'s resort, Fleischmann\\'s, in the Catskill Mountains. But Molly\\'s kitchen belonged to the nation.The documentary Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg salutes Berg and her far-reaching influence.Kempner creates a poignant reminder of one of the most influential, if now largely forgotten, great ladies of entertainment.Yoo-Hoo Mrs. Goldberg is a fascinating glimpse at a world gone by -- one that was receding quickly even as Gertrude Berg was trying to chronicle it.In Aviva Kempner\\'s affectionate documentary Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg, Berg, who once polled second only to Eleanor Roosevelt as one of America\\'s most respected females, is given her due. Or at least her showbiz due.Berg\\'s name no longer rings so many bells, but Aviva Kempner\\'s documentary Yoo-Hoo, Mrs. Goldberg may change that.This generally excellent portrait does much to fill the void, restoring an unfortunately forgotten figure to her rightful place among broadcasting\\'s trailblazers.This wonderful doc about radio and TV icon Gertrude Berg is a cornucopia of nostalgia for viewers of a certain age. The pain of [Davies\\'] latter-day distance from his home town comes through poignantly.[]Terence Davies, England\\'s greatest living filmmaker, has released only six features, and this one is his first documentary, a mesmerizing and eloquent essay about his native Liverpool.The film invites a reverie. It inspired thoughts of the transience of life.Davies has carried out the duty of expansive memoirs. Instead of high-tailing it away from the rigors of reminiscence, he pushes headlong through them.Davies is a master of melancholy self-reflection. This film sheds light on where his feature films came from, as much as the city he lost.Past and present are summoned up, and contrasted, yet their emotional impact is intermingled in a collage of archival images and footage, and newly filmed material, set against music, sound and the filmmaker\\'s voice.The filmmaker\\'s passion, coupled with a sly sense of humor, suggest that this is a film that will resonate long after it\\'s over.A warm and extremely thoughtful journey, with a deliberately bare-bones narrative.Of Time and the City is a difficult film to describe but a distinct pleasure to experience.[A] mesmerizing, visceral and heartfelt, a lushly rendered assembly of colour and black-and-white archival footage that evokes not only a remembrance of things past, but perhaps as they never were.A short, beautiful, characteristically sublime memory piece by the great British auteur Terence Davies.Of Time And The City is a caustic, witty, regretful elegy for a place so transformed that it\\'s virtually unrecognizable.The documentary Of Time and the City looks at the pains and pleasures of growing up Roman Catholic and gay in postwar Britain.No nostalgic \\'Penny Lane\\' or \\'Strawberry Fields\\' here. The filmmaker prefers an angrier form of sentimentality.Terence Davies\\'s first film in eight years is a beauty.But it\\'s a sham, a risible and almost militantly superficial piece of regional PR that exposes the snobbish and flimsy foundations on which Davies\\'s bewilderingly inflated reputation rests.What a lovely film this is, and what a welcome comeback for one of Britain\\'s greatest film-makers.Droll, angry, erudite, moving, this is the most poignant, beautiful, entrancing British film of the year.And, by being so personal in a way that\\'s so honest and so incisive, Davies indirectly offers national commentary that\\'s relevant far, far beyond his old Merseyside doorstep Tells the story of its subject in a clear, accessible, and gimmick-free manner while still preserving, or perhaps even cultivating, a core sense of wonder at the creative monuments he bequeathed to us all.In Search of Beethoven trudges through the composer\\'s life and works, pausing along the way for the usual smorgasbord of talking heads and performance clips. The results are shapeless, drab and mostly predictable.With In Search of Beethoven, documentarian Phil Grabsky has created a splendid work that will be a revelation to the uninitiated and a joy to music lovers.Grabsky\\'s appreciation of Ludwig van Beethoven follows the familiar contours, but it pays attention to the humanizing specifics that bring us closer to the subject.Grabsky does manage to convey how shockingly dramatic Beethoven\\'s music seemed to the first people who heard it, and the musicians\\' sensitivity and articulation--both verbal and musical -- fire this chronicle of one man\\'s extraordinary artistic journey.There are too many snippets of music, too many talking heads, too little to define that great arc of the composer\\'s life and spiritual development. But no one who cares about the man and his music will miss it. For that I give credit to its subject.Beethoven\\'s creative life, with all its achievements, cannot easily be reconciled with the image of a difficult, solitary figure, shadowed by depression. Grabsky, to his credit, doesn\\'t try to make one life fit the other, but manages to illuminate both.As good as the film is, Beethoven remains mysterious. He refuses to roll over, so to speak.After the monotonous guide through history that was In Search of Mozart, Phil Grabsky\\'s follow-up plays like a much-needed shot of adrenaline to the brain.What made Ludwig such a great musician? The documentary In Search of Beethoven, directed by Phil Grabsky, answers that question reasonably well.The film\\'s real resource is its impressive array of talking heads, their intimate familiarity with the music, and their ability to impart graspable insight.Beethoven\\'s painful insecurities and petty squabbles are deftly balanced with generous musical examples.The film stretches on too long... But the music soothes away a lot of complaints.Beautifully lensed and intelligently crafted.This sprawling (if somewhat overlong) film finds a level of discussion that should please aficionados and newcomers alike.[A] highly entertaining and informative biography, presenting Beethoven as a working artist rather than a caricatured grumpy genius.There is a lot of music, but never too much, and the story of Beethoven\\'s struggle with his life and genius emerges forcefully and movingly.If the interminable length of In Search of Beethoven doesn\\'t put people off this repetitive documentary about \"the world\\'s greatest composer\", then the lack of real insight into the man rather than the myth surely will.At such length and in such detail, there are certainly dramas to describe and insights to be had, but a film this static and self-important doesn\\'t really do them justice.One wallow does not make a summer, but the combined forces of Ludwig\\'s music and a chorus of celebrity erudition should help to take your mind off the April cacophony elsewhere. The result is a documentary that once again highlights that, of all sports, boxing is the one that cinema has been most successful in recording...Something draws us near-perhaps [James] Toback\\'s own fascination, at once self-serving and empathetic, with his soft-spoken protagonist.[]Just relentless lisping monotonous speech that makes the prospect of entering the ring with Mike seem attractive if only because it will be over sooner.There is something compelling about the way he presents his version of the stories and scandals that surround him.He\\'s amazingly frank about some of the people he doesn\\'t like, and he breaks down when he talks about his friends and the people he loved. A surprisingly fine documentary.Half-appealing, half-pathetic.It all adds up to a fascinating psychological study, a film that goes beyond both the public persona and the fighter\\'s own spin to get at the frightened, angry, explosive, yet utterly understandable boy who became a very troubled and very public man.The most remarkable revelation of the movie is its subject\\'s thoughtful, reflective eloquence and unflinching self-perception...Tyson may or may not be entirely who he says he is, but he\\'s probably not who we thought he was, either.Listening to Tyson tell his side of the story, you come to understand him with new depth and complexity.Some documentaries grow in the shadows; others demand to be made. The story of boxer Mike Tyson, powerfully recounted in a new film, is as rich as a Dickens novel.With no sense that Toback is pressing Tyson behind the camera, it\\'s easy to see this as more of a puff piece propping up Tyson\\'s sense of importance rather than any work of documentary filmmaking.Something of a clich??.I can\\'t say I\\'ve ever wanted to be in Mike Tyson\\'s head, but this documentary by James Toback certainly took me there, and I won\\'t soon forget it.When Tyson finally admits defeat and announces retirement, it\\'s those crinkly, hurting eyes you remember.The closest most of us will ever come to an intimate chat with the champ.More a testimony for the defense than a documentary, it\\'s a sympathetic portrait of a complex man driven by an anger that still bubbles beneath the surface.Hypnotic and ultimately incomplete.Toback, to his considerable credit, turns that view around by showing Tyson as a complicated person who has more thoughtful things to say.With Tyson, [director James] Toback has found a documentary subject as tragic and ridiculous, as bizarre and driven, as the heroes of his other films. Solid docu about global-warming informs rather than preaches.Earth may be the most striking collection of nature photography I\\'ve ever seen. It isn\\'t flawless, but it is a one-of-a-kind treat.I give directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield huge props for being able to so concisely whittle down their massive 11-episode magnum opus into such a delightfully entertaining and visually stimulating streamlined version.For most of the way this is an eye-popping, not blood-curdling, experience.For a round-the-world trip, it feels a bit like a budget bus tour.[The directors] know how to craft a sequence (lions and elephants uneasily drinking at the same water hole), have an eye for the telling shot (baboons mincing across a flood plain), and mercifully avoid making the fauna look human.As a spectacle Disney\\'s Earth is right out of this world.For adults, Earth misses the mark of riveting storytelling. Earth crams in the dramatic adventures of several species (including penguins) -- with the result that it comes up short on telling one really good story.Directors Alastair Fothergill and Mark Linfield mostly avoid speaking directly of social issues. Instead, they let the visuals and the animals\\' plights underscore the importance of maintaining a healthy ecosystem.Think of Earth as being akin to a greatest-hits collection of a beloved rock band. The context is gone, but the reason for the renown remains.This first release from Disney\\'s self-explanatory new arm, Disneynature, is at the very least peripherally concerned with the planet and its dwindling prospects, but the real renewable resource here is the groundbreaking Planet Earth miniseries.In a sea of Hollywood formula, artifice and escapism, here is an invitation to wonder, awe and gratitude.What it does well is so remarkable that by the time the credits roll you likely won\\'t want it to end.As a virtual tour of what Earth Day is about, kids ought to be entranced.

They\\'ve given us glorious images of an Earth that most of us have never seen. Let\\'s hope that the means to understand it will be included on the DVD.A wide-screen wildlife documentary in which the cycles of birth and death, migrations and seasons, are captured in stunning -- absolutely stunning -- ways. It\\'s always inspiring to see a genius at work. And that\\'s exactly how I felt watching Michael Jackson in This Is it--inspired.[]There are some who will claim this documentary is ghoulish. I think haunting is a better word, as you fathom what the music world would have been like had he lived.A bizarre and opportunist piece of film-making.The Michael Jackson we see here is not a self-styled Messiah or a tabloid oddity. He is, instead, what he always was underneath it all: a talented musician, a brilliant dancer, and one of the most gifted entertainers of his time.It\\'s purpose isn\\'t to reinvent Jackson, but to recapture some of the creative magic that made the kid from Indiana a worldwide musical ambassador.The last song we\\'re shown Jackson singing is \"Man in the Mirror\"; it\\'s a shame the filmmakers did not take a cue from its lyrics to put together an uncompromising assessment of Jackson, rather than delivering another attempt to perpetuate the myth.It\\'s an expertly packaged -- brilliantly packaged, considering how quickly the job was done -- phantasmagoria that emphasizes, quite convincingly, the energy that Michael could still draw from whatever was fueling his wraith-thin body.Michael Jackson\\'s perfectionism fails him in This Is It, and we\\'re all the better for it.Perhaps the best way to approach it -- at least for those who are not total Jackson fans -- is to view it as an often-fascinating document on how the sausage (or magic, if you will) is made for a mega-concert tour.It\\'s a fitting celebration of a controversial man\\'s last days, packaged prettily with a bow on top.In This Is It, Michael Jackson is once again The Thriller, the biggest pop star the world has ever known.Given just how much material Kenny Ortega and his editors plowed through to whittle together a two-hour scrapbook and they still could only just barely come up with the presentable material here isn\\'t exactly a vindication.A must-see danceumentary.Respectful without being mawkish or sentimental, the film is fashioned with the heart Jackson always demanded of himself. It\\'s not a great film, but This Is It is a fabulously entertaining account of somebody striving to be so one last time.This Is It is one of the best documents of live performance that I\\'ve ever seen, a rehearsal diary that\\'s more intimate and immediate than a traditional concert film.Michael Jackson\\'s posthumously released film about the preparations for his 50-concert comeback extravaganza is a strange creature indeed.This is his \\'68 Comeback SpecialAt best, it angrily demands to be rechristened This Is It! Too often, however, an incredulous This Is It? seems more apt.Death returned Michael Jackson\\'s humanity, and in a curious, tentative way so too does Michael Jackson\\'s This Is It. The frosty Winter is renowned for being something of a human steamroller, but the documentary shows the more interesting character to be her right-hand woman and creative director, Grace Coddington...One for the fashionistas.The September Issue is a misshapen, mix-and-match affair, an ill-fitting ensemble of individually compelling pieces.Give [Anna Wintour] a knife and a temper-raising goose and she wouldn\\'t be out of place chasing a screeching Karen Black around her apartment.Grace, the movie implies, is the genius behind what Vogue really sells, which is romantic aspirational fantasies for women.While it\\'s fun for fashionholics just to watch a movie in which people say \"It\\'s a famine of beauty!\" and \"The jacket is the new coat,\" the film becomes more substantial as it narrows its focus to two people: an artist and a curator.A mesmerizing study of the tension between commerce and creativity.Coddington, at least, gives us an appreciation of the talent seeing to it that the grandest fashion magazine of them all still sells the dream of glamour with style.An insider\\'s view of high fashion\\'s ultimate tastemakers proves it\\'s not just for aficionados.[Cutler] worms his way into subcultures without judgment or probing, preferring to let group dynamics speak for themselves.It\\'s kind of irresistible.RJ Cutler had plenty of access, but it\\'s pretty clear that from start to finish it was Anna Wintour who was in control of this movie.In director R.J. Cutler\\'s snappy documentary about the making of the September 2007 issue of Vogue editor Anna Wintour exhibits an icy, unflappable veneer.A slight, if often riveting, behind-the-scenes documentary.[A] wise, engaging frock-umentary.It\\'s got everything one could hope for in a movie experience: drama, wit, stifled rage, unbridled glee, pouty adolescents wearing far too much makeup, massive egos and a heroine who is absolutely irresistible.There\\'s something fishy about a documentary that takes its cues from a fictional movie.The September Issue really has only as much depth and relevance as fashion itself, but when we travel through the looking glass, it\\'s not usually the simple image on the other side for which we are searching.A splendid study of the forces and passions behind the world\\'s biggest fashion magazine.Consistently funny and engaging, \\'The September Issue\\' is also a window onto the top echelon of an industry in which fanciful escapism is deadly serious.Director, R. J. Cutler, gradually gets under the surface of this glossy universe, and the resulting film feels accurate and true. []Soul Power turns out to be an unusually resonant time capsule, one that weaves together theatrics, musicianship, cosmopolitanism and sharp political critique in a vibrant look-back that\\'s at once celebratory and wistful.It\\'s impossible not to be moved.It packs the emotional and historical power of a heady \\'family gathering\\' celebration of African and, to use the term then in fashion, Afro-American pride.Soul Power is the indispensable companion film to Leon Gast\\'s thrilling 1996 documentary When We Were Kings.Watching the Godfather of Soul on the big outdoor stage, you think back to his appearance in The T.A.M.I. Show a decade earlier. And then you think: I feel good.A dazzling chronicle of the African American music expo that was meant to accompany the 1974 Rumble in the Jungle heavyweight title bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire (now Congo).A non-stop head-bobbing knee-bouncer.As the record of a cultural event, Soul Power is a hit-and-miss affair.Gluttons for these artists and for music festivals in general might wonder, as I have, whether there\\'s any way the filmmakers might share more of the remaining 123 1/2 hours.Passionate fans of the music will relish these archived images while regular moviegoers will be entertained, but not moved by what they see.This has no contextual structure at all. It is essentially the archive footage slapped together.Director Jeffrey Levy-Hinte pads out the concert footage with not always stimulating backstage stuff, but the music makes it all worthwhile.A vibrant and joyous new documentary.Director Jeffrey Levy-Hinte does a terrific job re-creating a landmark moment, with behind-the-scenes footage complementing triumphant performances.This is musical history that deserves to be placed alongside the best of its era.An edifying glimpse at a moment in black history when the world really was looking on.As a concert film it\\'s unparalleled: a stunningly photographed, soul-stirring celebration.The documentary gives us a tantalising taste of what appear to have been some incredible performances. Such is the quality of the footage and sound recording that you rather wish the film was longer.Leon Gast\\'s documentary When We Were Kings, about the 1974 Ali-Foreman ?¬º√ºght in Zaire, now has a great companion piece. []It advances important and laudable ideas, but in a cliched, gimmicky way.It doesn\\'t sound like fun, and it isn\\'t fun to watch.Amiable enough, though it resembles a marketing tool for Beavan\\'s book about his project.An intriguing documentary offering trial and experiment.No Impact Man is certain to raise questions among viewers - questions about the Beavans, questions about ourselves, questions about degrees of sustainability. And asking questions is what it\\'s all about, isn\\'t it?No Impact Man is a very confused documentary that somehow puts its confusion to good use.This poignant, provocative documentary reduces the green movement to human scale -- and magnifies the size of mountain it\\'s trying to climb.A strange yet riveting portrait of a marriage enduring a year spent making as little environmental impact as possible.Like reality TV, there are moments of drama that have an aura of awkward self-consciousness about them and incidents that feel, if not staged, at the very least orchestrated, amped up. But you have to hand it to Beavan and Conlin.It may not be the greatest of cinematic exercises, and it often feels contrived, but this documentary somehow is enlightening, ridiculous, foreboding and funny at the same time.It all seems like a stunt, especially since Beaven has also written a just-published book about his experiences, but he and Conlin are an engaging pair who don\\'t let zealotry get in the way of humor.You may find Colin Beavan unbearably smug, but at the heart of his mission lies an inconvenient truth: Our consumable, disposable, unsustainable culture is destroying the planet, and there\\'s no way to change that without making sacrifices.Unsparingly exposes the confused power dynamics of a certain kind of modern middle-class marriage.Finally an environmental advocacy film for those of us who have the best of intentions but a weakness for Peet\\'s espressos, takeout dinners and an occasional Marc Jacobs sale, to say nothing of a dependence on toilet paper...The film, like Beavan himself, leaves an unholy mess of contradictions in its wake, but most productively, a great deal of those contradictions are our own.The family has its struggles, certainly, but even more than a statement about the environment, No Impact Man offers a thoughtful narrative on the compromises of marriage and how this particular couple found a way to meet in the middle.How much can we possibly glean from a guy whose idealism can be measured with a calendar?An enviro-doc that doesn\\'t soft-pedal the fact that the calculated, consciousness-raising media event it chronicles is a conceptual stunt, No Impact Man manages to present its New York do-gooder couple as both likably idealistic and inevitably confNo Impact Man -- the film and the book -- could well end up instruction manuals. []If he\\'s even half right, the world our children and grandchildren will inherit doesn\\'t bear thinking about.[][]Chris Smith\\'s documentary centres on a long and disquieting interview with Michael Ruppert, a radical American activist on a mission to expose the \"peak oil\" cover-up...Smith treats Ruppert both as exhibit and patient, and he comes across as an angry yet compassionate man, secure in his convictions but lost in his emotions.Intelligently probed by director Chris Smith and always compelling to watch, the chain-smoking Ruppert\\'s vision of the future should be on everyone\\'s viewing list.Rich on rhetoric, if sometimes a little loopy in the ideas beneath.His theories start to live up to the title of the film but he does raise some interesting points of discussion that aren\\'t a part of the international discussion nearly as much as they should be.Ruppert unexpectedly breaks down, weeping openly for the lost future of humanity, and at that moment I was startled at how bad I felt for him -- and how nervous I was, suddenly, that this contemporary Cassandra might just be right.It\\'s only when he starts to weep for the future of a population that won\\'t heed his warnings that Ruppert shows his humanity. It\\'s made him abandon his cause and quit writing.There is controversy over Ruppert, and he has many critics. But one simple fact at the center of his argument is obviously true, and it terrifies me.Collapse will leave you shaken about the future of the planet, and saddened about the shattered life of the messenger.Collapse\" is a grueling peek at a doomsday prophet\\'s rigorous mind but in a sly way also a compassionate look at the strain Ruppert endures from knowing he has only ever been right.Like with The Fog of War, Collapse is intentionally, deceptively one-dimensional, and it\\'s up to you to fill in the other half of the debate with your own opinions.It would have been helpful had Smith put his words into some sort of context, allowing others to assess his theories. Instead there\\'s simply Ruppert, talking, raging and warning, as if his very life depended on it.Collapse is boring. But what do you expect from a one-sided movie about a kook, who, at the time the film was shot, faced eviction from his home because he hadn\\'t paid the rent?Not just sobering; it\\'s a full-on assault.[]There are many layers to the man and the movie, and it\\'s hard not to leave the theater shaken. Disturbing yet fascinating...Timoner\\'s laudable impulse to chronicle recent history is wasted on insipid overstuffed montages and redundant testimonials, skirting real engagement with the culture in favor of cover-story hooks.Josh Harris focuses the lens on himself. You probably have never heard of him. And when the film is over, you may wish you still hadn\\'t.A disturbing perspective on what the digital age has done to our individual perceptions of ourselves, but a fascinating study of a man on a mission...or two...The big question is whether we\\'re now living in a more pragmatic time.Mercifully, Harris has now run out of money, but I fear we haven\\'t heard the last of him.[Timoner\\'s] film - cobbled together over 15 years - has grown so beguiled by its wonky, disquieting hero that it has lost its distance and mislaid all scepticism.What Timoner has done for sure is assemble another documentary of monumental scope. She has a priceless knack for being in the right place at the right time, allied to a filmmaker\\'s instinct for narrative, and a journalistic tenacity.Another bizarre, bewitching tale from those that make up life in, on and around the worldwide web.We Live in Public is the kind of nonfiction film that seems to have been conceived to prove that truth is stranger than almost any fiction...This is a remarkable film about a strange and prophetic man. What does it tell us? Did living a virtual life destroy him?Midway through We Live in Public, one Quiet participant delivers the hard social lesson of cyberspace: \"The more you get to know everyone, the more alone you become.\"Timoner, who also directed the now-classic rocker doc Dig!, makes a bold and trenchant argument, via Harris\\' pseudomorphically perverse life, that we are all now \"slaves to little boxes,\" and it\\'s true, Tweetpeeps, isn\\'t it?Harris, who appears throughout in interview footage, is an interesting mix -- someone with a serious inability to connect with other people and yet at the same time someone with a consistent ability to see the future.If anything, the film is a reflection of the Web zeitgeist, where observation comes easily but insight is rare. What saves the documentary from becoming a complete frustration is the sheer, stunning prescience of Harris.Like Timoner\\'s DIG!, this astounding new docu burrows into the thin and darkly funny spaces between artistry and vanity, isolation and community, collaboration and exploitation, sanity and madness.There must be a reason why, after all these year, Timoner chose to make a movie about Harris. If you figure it out, please let me know.A snapshot of several New York eras that coincide with the Internet\\'s growing pains.We Live in Public looks at one man\\'s experiments with issues of privacy.On that count, Timoner is correct: Harris is unduly obscure. But was what he accomplished really all that great? [][][]The mood\\'s too good-spirited, and in that there are great pleasures - not least the sound-of-mind thinking of three rockers putting paid to the tired clich of burbling rock gods trapped in their own shadows.The film might have benefited from a trim and a more linear approach, but mostly it fulfils its role as an illuminating homage to both the protagonists involved and, above all, the guitar as popular music\\'s most timeless icon.For guitar freaks and fans of these guys, the film gives you a unique chance to hang out with some real guitar heroes.A bizarre follow-up to the fifth biggest cinema documentary of all time, and one that\\'s as testing on the patience as a 10-minute guitar solo with extra tremolo.Even for me, a rock illiterate, this is interesting.The film gets up close and personal, proving that each is a musician first and a rock \\'n\\' roll star afterwards.[]For once a film\\'s tagline strikes the right note. \\'\\'It might not affect the way you play guitar, but it will change how you listen.\\'\\'By delving into their backgrounds and character quirks, Guggenheim aims the film beyond the interests of purists, academics, fans and musicians to provide an adventure film exploring the heart of creativity.Guitar heroes, real or imaginary, will think they\\'ve died and gone to heaven.The trouble is, once you get past the historical information and chummy interviews, you have to put up with the inevitable risk of any ad-hoc jam session: It Might Get Boring.Davis Guggenheim\\'s contrived documentary is a largely unrewarding essay on the mystique of the ubiquitous electric guitar...Rock fans and Guitar Heroes in the making will get a charge out of visiting where the happy accidents that put guitars into each man\\'s hand happened. And the playing isn\\'t bad, either. Loud. But good.For guitar geeks, the sight of Page, Edge and White together in one room will be enough. Others, however, can\\'t help but wish it might have gotten a little louder.It Might Get Loud is never dry, never too technical, boasts fantastic concert footage -- and the soundtrack is killer.It does make you want to pull out some old records and listen with a new appreciation for certain sounds you once might have taken for granted.The film\\'s very title is a tease, however: It never gets all that loud, and you might doze off after 30 minutes of watching this unwieldy power trio. Inside Job is far more watchable than it should be.I\\'ve only scratched the surface of this intelligent, riveting and informative film, which I cannot commend too highly.Here\\'s the biggest story of our time, lucidly told.[]Inside Job tackles the mess head-on with a kind of bitter pragmatism, reconstructing the system that failed and circling its weak spots.This film is as gripping as any thriller. Aided by some fascinating interviews, Ferguson lays out an awful story.An insightful and thought-provoking doc that will enrage and frustrate after digestion.It\\'s a horror movie, in a way, one designed to make you angry and want to do something about it.You\\'ll need a clear head to follow this impressive and angry American doc about the financial meltdown...A sharp study of corporate greed for those who felt Michael Moore pulled too many punches.Praise be for Inside Job, which crunches the credit crunch into 1hr 45mins of easily digestible fact biscuits, fed to you one by one by narrator Matt Damon.An exhaustively infuriating recap of the causes and effects of our country\\'s three decade-commitment to financial deregulation.This scathing expose should be enough to alarm people all over the political spectrum.Ferguson\\'s provocative questioning is one of the greatest lessons of Inside Job. That and his demonstration that the current economic crisis is definitely not too difficult for us to understand -- and correct.Wall Street owns Washington. You might think you know this, but \"Inside Job\" makes you feel the enormity of it.You don\\'t have to know the difference between a credit default swap and a collateralized debt obligation to feel enraged anew by Charles Ferguson\\'s thorough dissection of the country\\'s economic collapse of 2008.Whether it\\'s parsing the definition of a derivative or detailing the bad faith of major financial institutions, the new documentary Inside Job approaches its deconstruction of the financial meltdown with laserlike focus.[Ferguson] can get to a story later but provide so much more context that his film seems definitive.Inside Job is densely packed with information, charts and graphics, but the film is propelled by an angry, fiery pulse...Large portions of it had me twisting and turning in my seat to such a degree I\\'m sure it would have been distracting had someone been sitting behind me, a lot of what Ferguson documents so damning and ill-inducing they\\'re difficult to describe. With Walker and cinematographer Dudu Miranda, Muniz has a hawk\\'s eye for the weird beauty of bulldozed hillocks of trash and the catador faces that he chose to star in photographic portraits.Muniz is a gifted, modest and altogether delightful man, and his project is both aesthetically fascinating and philosophically stimulating.A well-made and often uplifting film that refuses to get angry yet still manages to point out that things aren\\'t as they should be for a great many.The glimpses of favela life will make you thank your lucky stars you weren\\'t born there.Perhaps not life-changing but certainly life-affirming.This is undoubtedly a bold raid into an unknown territory - both geographic and conceptual - that the prosperous classes prefer not to think about.Walker finds inspiration and strange beauty in the squalor.As in her memorable Blindsight, in which sightless climbers took on Everest, Walker celebrates the indomitability of the human spirit.Compelling and vivid, it\\'s another fine piece of work from an up-and-coming talent.I do not mean to make their lives seem easy or pleasant. It is miserable work, even after they grow accustomed to the smell. But it is useful work, and I have been thinking much about the happiness to be found by work that is honest and valuable.It shows us how artists find ideas and concepts for their work from the most unlikely sources, and it demonstrates the power of art to spark curiosity and cultural awareness in even the poorest, most underprivileged people.While we await the definitive documentary about the glut of garbage, \"Waste Land\" reduces this global catastrophe to touchingly human scale.It\\'s sheer pleasure watching Muniz work -- seeing him seized by mad impulses of delight.\"Waste Land\" is a testament that things can go from good to bad in an instant. But they can also improve just as quickly.It\\'s not a very good title, Waste Land - this isn\\'t a bleak film, at all - but just about everything else in Lucy Walker\\'s documentary works, and illuminates.\"Waste Land\" is a film about recycling, but it\\'s far more intriguing than the average eco-documentary.\"Waste Land\\'\\' is just what the film\\'s website says it is: \"stirring evidence of the transformative power of art and the alchemy of the human spirit.\\'\\'\"Waste Land\" is a must-see PBS-style Cinderella story with true grit, a brilliant cast and an improbably big heart.That a beautiful film could be set in the world\\'s largest garbage dump sounds like an oxymoron, but acclaimed documentarian Lucy Walker has pulled off precisely that feat in her profoundly moving \"Waste Land.\"[An] inspiring documentary. Rivaling China\\'s finest documentarians, first-time director Lixin Fan begins his Last Train Home with a handful of unshakable images.Chinese-Canadian director Lixin Fan considers the social upheavals wrought by China\\'s economic miracle.Last Train Home is a harrowing experience. Don\\'t expect to come out smiling.It is a sometimes shocking, oftentimes heartbreaking look at what it takes to raise children in a culture where grueling factory work can take parents away from their young for months at a time.This small masterpiece of documentary filmmaking offers a human-scale look at the impact of China\\'s industrial growth.Lixin Fan, handling his own cinematography, shoots with such a painterly eye that he almost undermines the social critique he\\'s making.Last Train Home suggests that the times they are a-changin\\'. The rulers of China may someday regret that they distributed the works of Marx so generously.Fan\\'s fly-on-the-wall perspective enables the viewer to empathize with all the players in the family drama, unlikely to have a happy ending.What else do you want? The question echoes down every frame of this haunting film, and Fan doesn\\'t pretend to have an answer.Lixin Fan\\'s Last Train Home is a remarkable documentary that, by following a family of factory workers during a three-year period, says a lot about China and its difficult transition to economic powerhouse.It\\'s depressing enough to watch this family\\'s struggles with life. But their pain really hits home when you think that the pants you might be wearing could have contributed to it.An expert, unobtrusive observer, Fan disappears inside his own film and allows us to get completely inside his subjects\\' lives.Fan\\'s camera moves sinuously through these people\\'s lives and gives a human face to a national panorama.This is essential viewing for understanding our world.Tells the story of a family caught, and possibly crushed, between the past and the future--a story that, on its own, is moving, even heartbreaking. Multiplied by 130 million, it becomes a terrifying and sobering panorama of the present.Last Train Home is a startling look at the devastating human cost of China\\'s newfound embrace of capitalism.Lixin plays up the atmospheric underclass misery in service of a beautifully shot, heartbreaking vrit narrative about generation gaps and culture clashes.Doing double duty as the film\\'s cinematographer, Fan demonstrates a pitch-perfect photojournalistic eye.Last Train Home is an intimate portrait of an unfathomable immensity, focusing on a single family caught up in the world\\'s largest mass migration.Helmed by Fan Lixin, who also takes credits as d.p. and co-editor, the pic laudably adopts an intimate, personal approach to a subject -- hardworking Chinese garment workers -- that\\'s been covered in more hectoring fashion elsewhere. Malmberg hangs back, allowing the character of Hogancamp - rather than any contrivance or \"plot\" - to power the film.[]Simultaneously hypnotic and unnerving, it asks some rather uncomfortable questions about the nature of art and the potential and limits of self-healing.Director Jeff Malmberg sees something in Hogancamp that he wants all of us to see, an imperfect human scarred by horrific trauma who nonetheless finds a reason to live.Hogancamp\\'s alliance with director Jeff Malmberg in this artful and poignant film marks a victory in the war against the self.A fine, delicately nuanced portrait of an artist compelled by mysterious forces to create something utterly unique.But for me, it is the human drama of one man tackling his own injustice through a lens distinctly of his own imagining that is the most important element.If you have even a passing interest in outsider art, you owe it to yourself to see \"Marwencol.\"May be aesthetically rough around the edges but it nonetheless offers an empathetic view on a stunningly unique figure.Marwencol is about Hogancamp and his miniature alter-ego, about his photographs and his creative process. But it is also, on a deeper level, about how we process our experiences...A celebration of the transformative power of art in coping with so many of the challenges people face -- healthcare problems, post-traumatic disorders, alternative lifestyles.This tender documentary considers the mysteries of both art and coping.Woven together by Jeff Malmberg -- if not seamlessly, then with illuminating patience -- these disparate strands honor an individual as unique as the miniature universe on which he depends.Marwencol\" poses penetrating questions -- about art, outsider status, the mysteries of the human brain and the possibility of second chances -- all while circling, ever closer, an unforgettable individual and the unknowable creative impulse.First-time director Jeff Malmberg tells Hogancamp\\'s fascinating story with sensitivity, never resorting to exploitation.Jeff Malmberg\\'s documentary does an amazing job of turning this small patch of dollhouses into a vibrant world of its own, utilizing Hogancamp\\'s own extraordinary pictures of Marwencol\\'s inhabitants to great effect.A must-see.An astounding movie one of those tales of all-American oddness that just keeps flowering into weirder, richer territory.About as fascinating as a documentary can get.Malmberg applies stylistic and structural tricks to create the most compelling portrait possible, reflecting a respectful but very different agenda from that of his subject. its most emotionally raw moments are indicative of their military subjects\\' exceptional comfort level with their observers ( ... ) the arid yet woody outcroppings high above the valley are an intriguing new terrainRestrepo avoids political discussion. It just revels in the heroism of these impossibly young, brave soldiers who follow orders that at times seem pointless because following them is what their country has asked them to do.Captures the complex human face of modern warfare.Restrepo is an exercise in visceral intimacy.It is a scary, moving and troubling film.Film doesn\\'t get more relevant.Powerful, terrifying and soulful, this real-life Hurt Locker is an intimate, often brilliant insight into combat and comradeship.The camera lingers on the soldiers\\' smiles and tears and shows the human face of military tactics which reduce people to chess pieces.At this point in all our Middle Eastern conflicts, we need more from a documentary than just a grunts-eye-view of the frustrating nature of the war.The directors were satisfied with telling us about a group of courageous, honorable young soldiers -- a salute these men richly deserve.A look at both the tragic folly of war and the camaraderie of men under pressure, the documentary Restrepo holds both hope and horror.In hewing closely to the rhythms of war, Junger and Hetherington forgo different considerations about war.An example of photojournalism at its finest.The reaction of a soldier to the death of another - unvarnished, disbelieving grief so raw it\\'s difficult to watch - is among the most moving footage of war and its cost imaginable.The relative formlessness of Restrepo is, in itself, a kind of dramatic structure. It reflects the stop-start waywardness of war in general, and of this war in particular.By keeping the focus solely upon the outpost and the soldiers who lived and fought there, the co-directors effectively seal the film off from any external influence.Though Hetherington and Junger\\'s film doesn\\'t ultimately have anything new to say about the nature of war, it will nonetheless have a strong impact on those of us fortunate enough to have experienced combat only in its motion-picture form.Try as it might to keep its distance from opinion and focus on the facts, Restrepo can\\'t help leaving you with a sense of despair about the situation in Afghanistan.Hetherington and Junger\\'s fair-minded chronicling of military experience remains a valuable piece of filmmaking, perhaps essential in reminding us of what warfare extracts from those who fight it.A riveting, you-are-there, deployment to a godforsaken place where United States troops are pinned down by enemy fire almost every day... Banksy proves that his talents extend beyond the spray can to the movie camera.[]The plain fact is that, on some level, it doesn\\'t matter whether the film is true or not. Either way, it\\'s fascinating. Either way, we learn a lot. Either way, it\\'s a great film.A provocative and absorbing exploration of what constitutes art, the creative process and the power of hype to triumph over talent.It\\'s endlessly arguable and open for debate. At the very least, we can all agree that Banksy has found a new wall on which to plaster his art -- that of the silver screen.As the documentary morphs into a riddle about art in the marketplace, the eyes of the beholder get crossed, and the dizziness is part of the fun.Hoax or not, Exit Through the Gift Shop ends up energizing, aggravating, enjoyable and revealing. Is it art or isn\\'t it? Who knows? Apparently no one.Put-on, satire, mockumentary, goof? Whatever it is, \"Exit Through the Gift Shop\" is an original.Like Banksy\\'s best street work, it pushes and prods our gullibility buttons and sends the mind swirling with questions of artistic authenticity and intent.Exit Through the Gift Shop offers an absorbing glimpse of a bracingly subversive slice of the culture, as well as some tantalizing images of Banksy at work.Some have suggested that the whole story, including the emergence of Mr. Brainwash, is an elaborate hoax engineered by Banksy to satirize the commodification of art. If so, it\\'s a brilliant one.The brilliantly untrustworthy documentary Exit Through the Gift Shop reminds us that a film can start out in one direction and then change course so radically, it becomes an act of provocation unto itself.The widespread speculation that Exit Through the Gift Shop is a hoax only adds to its fascination.Fascinating.This initiates a role reversal in which documentarian becomes artist and vice versa.One of the best, most karmically satisfying comedies of the year, much to the chagrin of the people who are in it.Exit Through the Gift Shop feels dangerously close to the promotion of a cult -- almost, dare one say it, of a brand.Exit could be a new subgenre: the prankumentary.The film is a curiosity. It\\'s both an attempted documentary of an artistic movement and a bemused examination about why the movie failed in that mission.Banksy makes an appealing narrator with a deft grasp of the questions raised. Gasland will no doubt spark the political debate it intends.Josh Fox puts a fresh spin on a well-drilled - if continually relevant - story.Cheney, the great outdoorsman, nearly killed a friend while hunting. That was nothing, however, compared with what he\\'s been doing to thousands of his fellow countrymen.With a remorselessness all the more powerful for its quiet unfussiness, Fox builds up a riveting portrait of near-apocalyptic environmental damage and a corporate mindset willing to ruin water sources irrevocably for the sake of a few years\\' profit.It\\'s a powerful film.Gasland may be the first ever American film in which Nixon is the hero. It is the 101st in which Dick Cheney is the villain.While the hushed tones of Fox\\'s would-be na?¬ªf commentary slightly grate after a while, his film\\'s images, contrasting natural beauty with industrial horror show, are bracingly effective indeed.This very good documentary by noted American troublemaker Josh Fox details the contamination of drinking water caused by the drilling for natural gas and explores the callous corporate mentality behind it.The film is a powerful alarm -- and an evocative one.An exhaustive and eye-opening look at natural-gas drilling and its potential dangers.There\\'s an acerbically straightforward, old-fashioned muckrake gurgling with righteous pugnacity beneath the mannered surface of Josh Fox\\'s Gasland.With its jolting images of flammable tap water and chemically burned pets, New York theater-director-turned-documentarian Josh Fox\\'s Sundance-feted shocker makes an irrefutable case against U.S. corporate \"fracking.\"It\\'s not pretty, but it works for some. Gasland won a special jury prize at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival. a new and uniquely disturbing perspective on the ShoahFilmmaker Yael Hersonski reshapes the impossibly vile and tragic source material into a devastating record of Nazi criminality.It\\'s impossible to watch A Film Unfinished and not feel haunted by the restless ghosts of history and those who tried -- and failed -- to use film to tell a lie.Yael Hersonski\\'s documentary is infuriating, heartbreaking, devastating -- and scary. It depicts a lie upon a lie.Yael Hersonski\\'s A Film Unfinished reclaims history, teaches a lesson about the reliability of images and raises unanswerable questions about complicity.A remarkable new documentary that reminds us of film\\'s inherent capacity for lying.A Film Unfinished reminds you that the nightmare of the Holocaust knows no limits.Discovered after the war, the film contains horrific images of starvation, poverty and humiliation, interspersed with surreal scenes of well-dressed Jews enjoying a restaurant dinner or an urban stroll.A Film Unfinished is a profoundly unnerving historical document.What we are left with is perhaps one of the most disturbing 60 minutes of raw footage ever put together.The result is a harrowing, unsettling journey -- a terribly moving document.A Film Unfinished may not be the strangest making-of documentary you\\'ve ever seen. It may, however, be the most affecting.Hersonski not only dispels the big lie at the center of the Nazi footage but she ingeniously separates and identifies the many smaller lies and where they entwined with facts.It is a privileged experience to watch A Film Unfinished. There is no other historical document like it but, of course, its lasting value is as a human document.[]A Film Unfinished is affecting as a rare document of a terrible place and time, and those who lived there.There is only about an hour of it, but around it filmmaker Yael Hersonski has built a striking feature.Extremely unsettling and thought- provoking.It will test your faith in humanity, but Hersonski\\'s film is nonetheless a brilliant reminder of the importance of bearing witness.Moving, mysterious and intellectually provocative, A Film Unfinished positions familiar Holocaust horrors (the R rating was unsuccessfully contested) within a philosophical commentary on the way we view images. Wiseman captures these staccato polyrhythms both visually and sonically. There\\'s not a lot of hitting here; he clearly delights in the sport\\'s balletic beauty.[][]Graceful and quietly inspiring.Even with no traditional narrative, there are wonderful discoveries to be made in Wiseman\\'s film, which is a nice complement to the experienced director\\'s ballet-themed last feature, \"La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet.\"Don\\'t go to Boxing Gym expecting pugilistic melodrama about long-shot underdogs. There\\'s not an ounce of fat or clich in Frederick Wiseman\\'s new documentary.The soundscape, too, is endlessly fascinating, a layer cake of squeaks, grunts, gasps, and rattling chains that, combined, catches a rhythm that sounds an awful lot like song.For legendary documentarian Frederick Wiseman to follow La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballet with a film set in a down-market Texas boxing gym seems unlikely -- until you see Boxing Gym, and how it and its subjects dance.Frederick Wiseman must drive certain nonfiction filmmakers crazy. He makes it look too easy.Wiseman films it all without comment, letting the rhythm of the place tell the story.We see multiple iterations of all manner of drills, and one of the pleasures of this film is that it understands that the more you look at something, the more mysterious and beautiful it becomes.It\\'s a boxing movie minus all the bull that usually goes with it.If it\\'s possible to make a completely gentle movie about boxing, Frederick Wiseman has done just that.Some documentaries have a way of sneaking into your brain and becoming reference points for larger subjects. Frederick Wiseman\\'s Boxing Gym is one of them.Pugilists and philosophers of all kinds converge in Frederick Wiseman\\'s mesmerizing documentary.Wiseman\\'s intimate-but-unrevealing approach suits the culture he\\'s observing.There\\'s no disputing the cumulative authority of Wiseman\\'s ongoing Human Comedy or ignoring the influence that his epic observational style has had on fiction filmmakers.Wiseman has often been able to find the major in the minor, and that\\'s certainly the case here.Wiseman, credited not only as director but as producer, editor and sound guy, makes the gym\\'s rhythm of motion and chatter into his chief subject - a ballet of sweat.The film captures the energy, the stresses and the tension of people striking punching bags and each other but without narration, it all feels a bit random and uninteresting. [The] doc offers fittingly low-tech amusement throughout --which is a hell of a lot more than can be said about the tediously incomprehensible movie it champions.Troll 2 has become a midnight favorite, and Stephenson looks at the phenomenon while catching up with his profoundly untalented costars and the grouchy Italian director.A documentary so enthusiastic, good-natured and sweet about such an abject disaster that it almost makes Troll 2 worthwhile.Delivers a well-rounded look at a remarkable turn of events without ever overdramatizing the actors\\' despair or over glamorizing their fame.It\\'s not often that a behind-the-scenes documentary is more entertaining than the movie itself but Best Worst Movie is not your typical Hollywood tale. There\\'s nothing typical about Troll 2.This curiously touching doc has a bittersweet ending.[A] surprisingly rich documentary.Somewhere, Ed Wood must be smiling.In 26 years as a film reviewer, I\\'ve never seen a film that so perfectly encapsulates the obsession Pauline Kael famously classified as Movie Love.Some movies are just bad. Some are so bad they\\'re good. And others are so intensely bad that they rise to a level of perverse greatness.The priorities seem misplaced, but the result is still sincere and interesting and often very funny.In its more amusing and accepting moments, Best Worst Movie captures the geek-joy fizz when fame morphs into notoriety, and artlessness becomes its own art.You might assume \"Troll 2\" aficionados are sarcasm-drenched hipsters, but \"Best Worst Movie\" argues that their appreciation is far less convoluted.For a while, the dentist and the documentarian revel in the celebrity-ness of it all %u2014 a glow that fades as they delve a little deeper.Tries to pin down the alchemy that transports a film from reject bin to cult favorite.A warm, jovial and decidedly uncritical look at both [Troll 2] and its rabid fans.Stephenson is too close to it all; he\\'s never able to truly dig below the cult flick\\'s frenzy, to examine the very real pain of both the film\\'s makers and the audience that takes rabid, gleeful delight in their folly.Stephenson\\'s self-exemption from his film\\'s scrutiny feels craven, especially when he visits screen-mother Margo Prey to ogle her infirm mother and kitten-themed dcor.It seems that the hunger for celebrity is so fierce that people will exploit anything -- even their most embarrassing moments -- to attain some measure of it.Best Worst Movie is the populist doc to beat this year, following in the footsteps of last year\\'s Anvil! The Story of Anvil and summarily outdistancing that self-serving and unchallenging crowd-pleaser. We may never know exactly who shot Pat Tillman on that ridge in Afghanistan or why, but we have a better idea of who he was.The Tillman Story is an illustrative, cautionary tale, a fact-finding mission that was ultimately stonewalled by Congress, as we witness in heartbreaking footage of the cover-up hearings.Bar-Lev\\'s documentary\\'s greatest service isn\\'t in recounting the Army\\'s back-pedaling so much as underscoring how communal needs and family grief don\\'t perfectly align. And that political usefulness may attempt to trump all other rites.The Tillman Story clearly lays out exactly what happened that caused Tillman to be blown to bits by fellow U.S.forces -- and the government\\'s efforts to whitewash the story to avoid mounting criticism of the war.Watching the film, emotions range from sadness, of course, to frustration to outright anger. This, truly, is the best we can do? Throwing up roadblocks in front of the truth, not trusting the American people to understand the nature of war...You are unlikely to see a documentary this year more powerful than The Tillman Story.Could you imagine how difficult it must have been to pore over records containing the brutal facts of your son\\'s death?[An] uncompromising documentary.It\\'s a sobering look at how governments operate in wartime, putting a shiny spin on even the grimmest of tragedies.Well-paced, methodical and seemingly thorough...Amir Bar-Lev\\'s The Tillman Story is a gripping drama that reconstructs Tillman\\'s life, death, and legacy.Who was Pat Tillman? Himself. That\\'s all you and the US Army need to know.The Tillman Story puts the lie that the cover-up of his death was the result of a series of errors firmly in the ground at last.A scathing indictment of how Tillman\\'s death, aided by complicitous media coverage, was cynically manipulated by the military as a propaganda windfall.It is enraging yet nuanced, an elusive combination for any documentary...The Tillman Story stands as a truthful and emotional eulogy to a fallen solider and one that would never have been told without Dannie Tillman\\'s determination.The Tillman Story plays the sparkling colors of Pat Tillman\\'s personality against the black and white of his state-sponsored myth.The Tillman Story unravels the deceptions -- and the deep dishonor -- that inflated life-size valor into fake superheroism.The Tillman Story is ferocious filmmaking, but it wouldn\\'t have half the force it does if the director didn\\'t also get at the complicated man Pat Tillman was ...Provocative and colorful as the film is, it does the very thing it denounces -- massaging the facts to seize Tillman for a political agenda. A Piece of Work is a refreshing look at a reluctant legend, one who\\'s still using all her might to break barriers for the rest of us to get a real kick out of.You will leave this film remembering that Joan Rivers is one very funny woman (albeit a vulgar one). You will also see her as a woman of great strength, a true show biz survivor.[]This behind the scenes, behind the makeup, behind the plastic surgery documentary catches Rivers hard at work, ridiculously hard at work.If you think it\\'s going to be as hilarious as a Joan Rivers standup routine, you\\'re wrong. The self-mocking jokes are funny, but almost make you feel guilty for laughing.The new documentary on Joan Rivers is so in your face, so fraught with harrowing, oversized personal stuff, you might want to get a theatre seat a couple of rows behind where you normally sit, to safely take it all in.Welcome to the on-screen psychoanalysis of Joan Rivers, of which she seems equal parts willing participant and antagonist.... pretty funny.Acting is about honesty, and there\\'s something evasive about both this film and its subject.An entirely sympathetic portrait of the artist at an advancing age.A compulsively watchable look at Rivers, show business and the price one pays to try to continue succeeding in it.Rivers comes across as someone much more complex and vulnerable than her abrasive \"Can we talk?\" persona. There\\'s a real woman under there, and she\\'s pretty great.But it all happened, the truths of the film so indisputably poignant I\\'m aghast at just how much they moved and intoxicated me.The undeniably fascinating and entertaining documentary that looks at the audacious entertainer in the seventy-fifth year of her life.Were James Brown still with us, he\\'d have to at least share his \"hardest working man in showbiz\" honors with Rivers.It\\'s one of the best movies ever made about the brutal and unforgiving world of show business, and what it takes to survive in it for decades.A fascinating, enlightening look at the dark side of show business and the issues that come with being a part of it for decades.The insecurities that seem to feed Rivers\\'s often angry humor -- and that have left her face looking like a mask frozen in horror -- are left unexamined.By the end of Stern and Sundberg\\'s portrait, you feel a great fondness for this tough cookie, who says she plans for her career to outlast George Burns\\' -- who was still working in his mid-90s.A witty, inspiring portrait of a life in constant reinvention. It\\'s possible that one of the reasons why the film wasn\\'t nominated for a best-documentary Oscar was because it was too horrifying.In the end, this is scattergun film-making, well-intentioned but sloppy, sometimes deliberately evasive. If this documentary were an exam essay, I\\'d fail it.A hectoring, simplistic affair that has nothing of value to contribute to the British debate.You know you\\'re in an endangered superpower when a vice-president who spells \"potatos\" without an \"e\" is followed two decades later by a president for whom the plural of child is \"childrens\".It may be the case that Guggenheim is a better instigator than filmmaker, as the debate about our educational system appears to be on the upswing at present. For this.... Waiting for \\'Superman\\' is essential viewing.Davis easily ties a sick education system to a sick society. But when it comes down to it, in the end he has no clear cure for what ails us. At the very least, though, he has exposed the disease for all to see.Your heart goes out to all these kids, but Guggenheim\\'s take on education stacks the deck against them even further by implying that only charters offer a ray of hope. Would that it were that simple.An admirable exercise in straight talk, especially in its tough assessment of the mediocrity-enforcing teachers\\' unions.By focusing on these five kids and their hopeful families, Waiting for Superman puts a human face on a crisis worthy of a superhero.We need another movie, one that shows us why some charter schools work and others dont.Guggenheim shows us that there is light at the end of this tunnel, we just have to be willing to do the hard work necessary to make sure those bulbs start burning brightly and that the flickering signaling their end comes to a stop.You leave the film convinced that radical change is necessary but uncomfortable with the closing voice-over that assures you how simple it will be to implement it.Waiting for \\'Superman\\' won\\'t satisfy anyone looking for a five-point plan. (It won\\'t win many fans among teachers\\' unions, either.) On the other hand, if it\\'s effective filmmaking you\\'re after, look no further.There is no question that this is compelling viewing, especially considering the largely abstract and policy-driven nature of the crisis.Waiting for \\'Superman,\\' filmmaker Davis Guggenheim\\'s scathing, moving critique of American public education, makes you actually want to do something after you dry your eyes.The photography and editing are accomplished, and the filmmaker frequently resorts to animation and other tricks to make his subject more palatable.This is more than an Important Documentary: it is engaging and, finally, enraging -- as captivating as any Superman movie, and as poignant as a child\\'s plea for help.Guggenheim succeeds in asking tough questions. At the end of the film, after he\\'s made us root for these kids and worry about the state of our schools, he asks: \"Did we do the right thing? Did we do enough?\"As Guggenheim\\'s camera gives us a close-up of the Educational Lotto, the implication is clear: Why gamble on the future of America\\'s children? Instead of helping some kids beat the odds, how do we change the odds for all kids?It\\'s meant to infuriate you and break your heart enough that you feel compelled to do something. There\\'s a great deal of agit with very little prop. Nothing is answered definitively here. But if there\\'s a real Cropsey to be found, it may be Staten Island itself.Disturbing and flavorful.Cropsey is a creepy documentary with all the elements of a horror film about a demented serial killer, and an extra ingredient: This one is real.This disturbing true-crime documentary takes its name from a local bogeyman that video makers Joshua Zeman and Barbara Brancaccio were warned about when they were growing up on Staten Island.A crude episode of 48 Hours.Begins as the documentation of a terrible legend, but evolves into a true story of a monster, and that\\'s what makes Cropsey downright frightening.Brancaccio and Zeman don\\'t offer any easy answers, merely throwing all of the many issues of the story of Cropsey into a melting pot of danger, terror, and secrecy.A documentary that delves into what happens when the ghost stories you told as kids, the stuff of urban legends, seem to come true.The story of the unsolved abductions and the man who might have become the scapegoat for a community is troubling enough. No big-screen trickery is required.Cropsey has all the trappings of a true-crime TV special, but with an undercurrent of cultural exposition that is intelligent, profound and unsettling.Modern horror films rarely capture that pit-of-the-stomach feeling the way this movie does.Perhaps most chilling is that the movie leaves the mysteries unresolved.The core of the story is standard TV fare (and the techniques aren\\'t exactly original), but the filmmakers tell it with wit, verve, and compassion.Perched at the intersection of psychological survey and serial-killer expos??, \"Cropsey\" loosens the girdle of the documentary form to accommodate much more than facts....they\\'ve gone to great lengths to raise questions in the audience\\'s mind about the [Rand] case. The answers they\\'ve found are questions, their conclusion, inconclusive.On several levels, this film is a real-life horror story that puts most Hollywood movies to shame.Cropsey continues what\\'s been a welcome trend this year toward documentaries with strong, surprising narratives.With tinkling thriller music and dramatic voiceover narration, this modest but engrossing first-person documentary comes on like a true crime caper.The latest Cinema Purgatorio release is really a scary story told in the dark, in the get-this whisper of documentary.The portentous narration and manipulative horror-film aesthetics turn what might have been a portrait of a boogeyman myth\\'s lingering societal role into merely a crude episode of 48 Hours. It\\'s a riveting story of personal hubris and political chicanery.Scary, fascinating stuff.Alex Gibney has a knack for telling great stories in a lucid fashion, and this story\\'s a good \\'un.As corporate exposes go, it\\'s best to stick with Inside Job.The film lights up a complex story like a pinball machine.Gibney doesn\\'t have anything more than tantalizing clues and a huge amount of circumstantial evidence, but he doesn\\'t need much more than that to indict Wall Street itself.As Gibney demonstrates in Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer, plenty of politicians remained in office amid similar revelations.It\\'s the coolness of Gibney\\'s account of the possibly systematic sabotaging of Spitzer\\'s career, perpetrated by a strangely camera-friendly cast of enemies-cum-conspirators, that makes it such transfixing viewing.\"Client 9\" is made with skill and intelligence, but I kept wanting to hear another story; one that I hadn\\'t heard before.You want tears? You want convulsive sobs, weepy remorse, pleadings for forgiveness? Well, look elsewhere, because Eliot Spitzer isn\\'t going to give them to you.He stretches the saga of Spitzer a bit too thin with a nearly two-hour running time that his story really can\\'t support but this is still a mostly-fascinating film.It leaves the unmistakable impression that there\\'s more to this iteration of a story that, animated by hubris, lust, self-deception and love of power, is sure to play out again.A sad, disturbing and in some ways tragic tale that in its lurid combination of sex and politics, banal hypocrisy and bare-knuckles power, seems very much an American story of our times.Say what you will about Eliot Spitzer, he\\'s a marvelous subject for a documentary, and Alex Gibney has made a film worthy of him...The portrait of Spitzer that emerges throughout Client 9 is of a straight-talking, no-nonsense individual whose non-political way of getting things done crafted a lot of enemies.Client 9 works like a good detective novel: Colorful and seemingly disparate characters are introduced, and then the strands that tie them together are revealed in a rich, sordid, thrilling tableau.It takes Gibney almost two hours to build his own argument regarding the airing of Spitzer\\'s laundry, and, having watched it twice, that length is inexplicable.It uncovers truths while framing events as a gripping whodunit. Gibney puts mystery back into a story we thought we knew.I wonder how Gibney operated the camera while on his back.The good stuff, as far as Mr. Gibney\\'s movie and Mr. Elkind\\'s book theorize, involves the power brokers who...might have had something to do with his downfall. Perhaps the most disturbing issue raised in Ben Steinbauer\\'s fascinating and often hilarious Winnebago Man has to do with the Internet\\'s awesome ability to reduce complex and apparently dangerous behaviour to the level of banal spectacle.A surprisingly poignant and enduring film.Absorbing and thought-provoking.When the director laments, \"I feel like I\\'ve stepped into the Winnebago Man outtakes,\" we can only concur.Although we find out a lot about this virtual hermit and develop an admiration for his cantankerous principles, the movie leaves some questions unanswered.The movie becomes oddly deep and even poignant.Winnebago Man becomes a much more interesting and troubling film when Rebney, a former journalist, demands to reclaim control of his messaging.Both the man and the film had reached outcomes that no one could have foreseen.This strange, darkly funny documentary investigates the story of Jack Rebney, a Winnebago salesman who achieved notoriety based on outtakes of a corporate video he shot in the 1980s.Winnebago Man is an intriguing look at the effects on one man\\'s life; whether they\\'re worth the cost is something Steinbauer leaves up to us.Raises intriguing questions about our culture of online humiliation and the real-life destruction it can leave in its wake.What this film is really about is how interconnected we all are, like it or not, on the Internet, and how alluring and alarming this can be.There\\'s a pathos lurking around the edges of Winnebago Man, and it has nothing to do with issues of fame or the power of the Web and everything to do with aging and alienation, neither of which the documentary seems able to comprehend.That Mr. Rebney is a real character comes as no surprise. What\\'s odd, given Mr. Steinbauer\\'s obvious intelligence, is the director\\'s blinkered view of his subject.Whenever Rebney gets to be Rebney -- be it insulting, sweet or wearily perturbed -- Winnebago Man shows a full tank of irascible charm.There is a genuine, human sympathy for his frustration and lashing out that goes along with the laughter.Brilliantly encapsulates the transformative power of the online video boom.[Director Ben Steinbauer\\'s] blend of exploitation and sincerity proves remarkably efficient, and helps illustrate how new media have democratized the arts.[A] frustrating, borderline exploitative, madly entertaining documentary.Good fortune smiled on this film, but the feeling persists: This triumph belongs to Rebney, not Steinbauer. The view is humbling and heavenly enough to make you feel puny and exhilarated at the same time.A movie like this can get you thinking.While at its heart a standard PBS-style documentary, the film ends up being an extraordinary standout achievement when viewed in a state of the art IMAX theatre.I\\'ve been to two launches, Apollo 11 and Apollo 12, and Hubble 3D is the first film I\\'ve seen -- and felt -- that does more than hint at the skeleton-rattling power of those stupendous rockets.Dazzling to look at of course. But such ponderous, clich??-heavy narration.It\\'s an out-of-this-world, real-life adventure for kids of all ages, budding Neil Armstrongs and Ray Bradburys alike.Contains some of the most spectacular 3-D footage I\\'ve ever seen...The daring mission by astronauts to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope in May 2009 is the perfect subject for a brilliant, thrilling 3-D Imax movie. Such a movie, alas, has yet to be made.It\\'s a movie that not only puts you in space but lets you travel through it with a speed and wonder that would make James T. Kirk go a little weak in the knees.A typical IMAX spectacle of enormous proportions, the film is both a fantastic summary of the knowledge we\\'ve gained through Hubble and an often edge-of-your-seat documentary about some of the specialists who\\'ve serviced the telescope five times.Leonardo DiCaprio, as narrator, sounds very nearly reverent, and not without reason.What does it say about me that when I see a state of the art 45-minute propaganda piece for NASA, I come away convinced I\\'ve had a deeply personal philosophical experience?The IMAX screen is the ultimate planetarium in the awesome documentary Hubble 3D.Audiences expecting a blissout of swirling galaxies will wonder why so much time is spent on astronauts sweating over screws and bolts.If you want an eye-popping cosmic epic, rent Star Trek. If you want interactivity, take the kids to the planetarium.Not only deposits you in outer space, but for the first time ever makes the old Star Trek gimmick of \"warp speed\" a reality.The newly resurgent 3D format gets an out-of-this-world showcase in Hubble 3D. [Don] Argott has made a worthwhile contribution to a controversy that deserves an audience.Argott beautifully explicates how this crew pulled off the most daring daylight art theft in history, though his passionate identification with the pro-Barnes faction limits the movie\\'s political nuance.The film\\'s good versus bad scenario is, while understandable, too simplistic.While The Art of the Steal makes a very convincing -- even bone-chilling -- argument... the film fails to even ponder why easier access to some of the world\\'s greatest art treasures might not be an entirely bad thing.It\\'s a tangled web spinning so far out of control if it were fiction no one would ever have believed it to be possible, die hard conspiracy theorists likely to find the scenario too outlandish even for them.The Art of the Steal ultimately gets mired in the legal weeds, a snare made all the more frustrating by the fact that the move is a fait accompli.It\\'s impossible not to be moved by the almost eerie film footage of the walls of the Barnes\\' original home with the art removed, revealing bare hooks and patches of unfaded paint: ghosts, doomed to wander.A blunt, persuasive documentary.I found it fascinating for a number of reasons, balanced reporting not among them.While outraged aesthetes tell us that the Barnes Foundation is a perfect jewel box of a museum, the filmmakers they hired to argue their case don\\'t spend enough time exploring or explaining what makes this cloister so special.The Art of the Steal lays out a good story, but perhaps not the whole story.No matter what side you\\'re on, you\\'re likely to be flabbergasted as The Art of the Steal details the twists and turns of chicanery and fate that brought his art to the pass it\\'s at today.The movie\\'s never less than entertaining, but you often feel like arguing with the screen, and not in a good way.What is finally clear: It doesn\\'t matter a damn what your will says if you have $25 billion, and politicians and the establishment want it.At times, The Art of the Steal is a bit too shocked by the vulgarity of commerce, but it\\'s memorable when it meditates on the changing face of where we look at art, and how that changes the art itself.I think it\\'s gripping.It\\'s a really interesting story, but I think it\\'s just too black and white.Calculated to enrage and pulling it off like gangbusters...Argott treats Barnes\\' story as an intellectual crime thriller, uncovering each new surprise - and a seemingly endless parade of villains - with a deadpan flourish.

In a classic case of filmmakers prioritizing their own pitch over the actual goods, Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost put Schulman\\'s toothy-grinned brother Nev front and center as he investigates his fishy long-distance Facebook crush.If you begin with the premise that all films, docs and dramas, are constructs of one sort or another and it\\'s the how and why that\\'s important, you\\'ll have fun pulling this apart.The film begs lots of questions about how, and when, it became clear any of this was worth documenting, but it certainly was.It really is an intriguing modern tale of communication, intimacy, self-knowledge and the web: a great companion to The Social Network.In the truth it finds, Catfish is a sad and troubling film that avoids cynicism.Just as you think you\\'re heading towards thriller territory, with street-smart New Yorkers confronting Midwestern loons, the film mutates into a study of benevolence, understanding and forgiveness.Unbelievable filmmaking.You have to see this new film called Catfish. Only problem is, I can\\'t tell you why. Which, admittedly, makes this review useless.It must be said that the filmmakers, who profess to be as surprised as we are about how things play out, are being disingenuous at best and underhanded at worst.And you thought MySpace was scary.The movie itself is an invasion of privacy, as the constant sparring between the filmmakers and their increasingly reluctant subject reminds us.The film tells a devastating story that couldn\\'t be more relevant to our times, who we are in real life versus the way we present ourselves online.At the end of this exquisitely poignant film, it\\'s clear we humans are going to need a refreshed emotional skill set if we\\'re to make sense of the real relationships we forge in our virtual worlds.There are some creepy chuckles to be had from this allegedly true account.A haunting exploration of identity, intimacy, desire, and the temptations of online relationships. And if you want the rest of my review, send me an email.A mildly intriguing exercise in guerrilla filmmaking, lapsed ethics and the potential for social-networking deception.There\\'s no denying its strong narrative or its emotional pull. And the film\\'s computer-influenced visual style is very much of the moment.Though it\\'s out of fashion in these days of Facebook and cellphone cameras, some stories might be better left unshared.It is affecting, surprising, heartbreaking (though not, despite the marketing campaign that would lead you to believe otherwise, scary).Catfish ... raises all sorts of questions -- about the imaginary realms that open when you click on your computer screen, about cyber-stalking, but also about journalistic ethics. [][][][]Auds will feel info-glut over the course of the two-hour-plus film, which is hardly the desirable response for a piece of reporting on the vital issue of the corrupting effect of money in American politics.The narrative trots all over the globe, including stops for labor exploitation in the Marianas Islands, dealings with Russian mobsters,ripping off Indian tribes in the desert southwest, and jetting to Scotland to golf with impressionable politicians.That the film is overlong ultimately testifies to its importance, though after a while, the outrageous details start to run together like surreal satire. Except, of course, that it\\'s all true.Abramoff documentary is appalling, entertainingGibney laudably launches a withering attack here on the pay-to-play relationship between lobbyists and lawmakers. But this viewer felt withered, too, by the end of his battering ram of a movie.Gibney is a busy boy, and he draws the lines between Abramoff and his friends -- and his friends\\' friends -- with the documentary equivalent of a highlighter.Casino Jack is designed as an indictment of a whole culture of influence peddling, a Beltway way of life where a pat on the back often comes with a kickback.The picture is briskly edited, and the energy never lags. But the amount of information the viewer is asked to process is voluminous -- and never stops coming.It\\'s an informative, interesting documentary that just barely comes together enough and tells an important enough story to merit a look, but it\\'s not the film that it could have been.Superlobbyist, Republican wheeler-dealer, and convicted felon Jack Abramoff may seem like old news right now -- he\\'s been trumped by Bernie Madoff et al. -- but what he represents, alas, is all too evergreen.The snarky tone, use of musical puns and jokey graphics (was Keith Olbermann an executive producer?) undermine the impact of the story.It\\'s a story well told, but Abramoff\\'s voice is missing: Gibney interviewed him in prison but could not film him. You wonder what this sweet-talker might say for himself, looking back over that long, ugly money trail.The crimes of conservative superlobbyist Jack Abramoff are already receding into the hopeless murk of congressional history, so this epic documentary by Alex Gibney is even more welcome for its reach.It really is compelling.It\\'s very entertaining as well as appalling.Casino Jack is audience-friendly without turning into a Michael Moore-ish clown show. []This mealtime footage of prey and predators isn\\'t just remarkable, it\\'s simply breathtaking, and it\\'s only one moment of many that had me holding my breath in wonder.Visually [it\\'s] quite seductive.Oh, it\\'s amazing.Its visual splendor more than makes up for its intellectual poverty.This monumental documentary gets intimate enough to hear a crab sneeze.There are life-and-death dramas, moments of playfulness and tenderness, which create an ever-increasing sense of wonder.Horseshoe crabs scuttle like possessed Nazi helmets and a school of fish morphs from dreidel to disco ball, as if choreographed by Busby Berkeley.Oceans is more of a random collection of images from the deep. But, boy, what images.It fulfills Jacques Cousteau\\'s statement that \\'the best way to observe a fish is to become a fish.\\'For all Oceans does to please the eyes and ears, it does nothing to engage the brain.The movie could -- should -- be a symphony, and it frequently makes excellent use of spare classical music. When Brosnan pipes up, he is as welcome as a car alarm.Perfect for families and exquisitely shot, this entry from the Disneynature division is even better and fresher than last year\\'s Earth.There have, over the years, been a lot of terrific undersea documentaries, but if you want to know what distinguishes this new one, it comes down to a single word: technology.You\\'re torn. Is this a work of nature pornography or consciousness raising? The movie thinks if it overwhelms us with the former, we won\\'t notice the relative absence of the latter.Though never quite as stirring as March of the Penguins or Winged Migration, it quickly establishes its own gentle pace.While it may not plunge deeply enough, Oceans continues the worthy efforts of explorers such as Jacques Cousteau, reminding us to respect nature and preserve the myriad life forms that rely on the ocean to survive.The voice-over almost manages to turn the majestic into the mundane. Almost.With a subject as literally vast as this one, it\\'s essential to either narrow the focus (make the film about one particular species, or region) or carefully construct the approach (group footage by theme). Oceans does neither.It comes to American theaters saddled with narration by Pierce Brosnan, who purrs through the gratingly vague script like the world\\'s plummiest old half-drunken uncle. We\\'ve gone backwards rather than forwards. To watch a film such as this is to shudder all over again.The film\\'s most sobering fact: any world leader has a maximum of 10 seconds to decide to retaliate in the event of a nuclear attack.[]Screamingly urgent and contemporary.Countdown to Zero leaves you uneasy enough about the threat from nukes, but also amazed that to date, at least, no blunder has ended in annihilation.A worthy, important effort - but not a great one.Comes loaded with a relatively big budget and a line-up of talking heads more powerful than a meeting of the Bilderberg Group.A valuable and scary film that should be seen.[]Like the ongoing threat itself, Countdown is simply numbing.Countdown to Zero may not be the most fun you\\'ll have in the movies this year, but it is absolutely mandatory viewing.Made-up horror movies have nothing on Countdown to Zero.The news is ugly. The film is often gorgeous and wields a cumulative power to humanize potential devastation.Lucy Walker\\'s Countdown to Zero is the most terrifying film of the year and one of the most frightening documentaries in a long time.A bluntly effective media campaign as opposed to a well-articulated documentary.Easily the scariest movie of the year.This is easily the scariest movie of the year, but like a lot of horror films, it goes a bit past the line that it needed to in order to make its point and loses its effectiveness through overkill.At least it makes you scared again. There\\'s nothing more frightening than what we\\'ve learned to live with.It\\'s easy to watch, impossible to deny, and very, very tough to forget.Walker adroitly mixes extensive newsreel footage, lively graphics and talking-head interviews with dozens of people, from scientists to think tank folks to world leaders... Ameena Matthews, Cobe Williams and Eddie Bocanegra used to instigate Chicago street violence. Now they live for nipping it in the bud, block by treacherous block.Where James\\'s film excels is as direct experiential cinema -- without narration, onscreen interviews or acknowledgment of the presence of the camera -- it is an intensely dramatic window into a world.A sobering but not hopeless look at how the Windy City is attempting to turn around a rising tide of street shooting, through the work of a unique group called CeaseFire.It\\'s a year in the life and death of the fight against the streetwise status quo, and James\\' doc brings it all horrifically home.There\\'s no doubt The Interrupters do some good; but there\\'s also no doubt the problem they\\'re facing is enormous.Realistically inspiring and, thankfully, not overly dramatized.The immediacy and caprice of violence in \"The Interrupters\\'\\' are just as strong as in nearly every documentary I\\'ve seen about the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Through understanding and fearlessness, this brave trio shows us, the world can be changed, tiny step by tiny step.A massive and compelling tapestry of life on the streets of Chicago.\"The Interrupters\" is an intense and chilling documentary about peacekeeping troops in a war zone.In the end, statistics are of less moment to this movie than the case-by-case personal successes that, in some cases, are emotionally overwhelming.Tense, moving, and, at times brain-draining.A heartbreaking, empowering documentary about inner-city violence...It tears at your heart with its depiction of the intractability of the problem. But it simultaneously insists, and makes you believe, that change is possible one person at a time.James\\' Hoop Dreams has been spoken of with reverence and wonder for 17 years; now, he has an equal to its reputation.The Interrupters, a documentary about an initiative to stop urban violence in Chicago, may be the most necessary film you\\'ll see this year.In a documentary career defined by fierce commitment to his subjects, Steve James delivers his most ambitious project yet in The Interrupters.Steve James\\' arresting documentary could benefit even more from a multi-part television treatment.The Interrupters is a heavyweight film about a heavyweight subject of clear interest well beyond the United States.Searing in its depiction of at-risk children in poor communities, the film is also the bracing, life-affirming story of residents who are beginning to reclaim their streets, one corner at a time. This is a compelling and engrossing film but, like I said, it\\'s not pretty, and it will break your heart. It broke my heart and, I\\'m not going to lie, I full-on wept.This haunting life story is an exquisite example of non-fiction filmmaking as full-bodied, emotionally complex drama.There is no question Nim was exploited for human gain, yet there are important aspects which Marsh leaves unexplored.Tales of the attacks Nim inflicted on his many carers are horrific, but there is a pervasive sense there was nothing else they could have expected.Project Nim nimbly serves up a profoundly sad tale that raises as many thought-provoking questions as it answers.The film teases us with a paradox: arguably Nim\\'s keepers were wrong to try to endow their protege with human attributes, but can we empathise with his suffering without making the same mistake?Funny at times, but also deeply sad, it\\'s a truly fascinating and well made documentary.Marsh\\'s film is as much a study of how we behave as a species as it is of what happens to Nim. And we don\\'t come off particularly well.The release of this documentary by James Marsh in the same week as Rise of the Planet of the Apes is wittily timed. It too speaks of caged primates, though its judgement on their captors is far more disturbing.This many-faceted time capsule sheds little light, but buried inside it are vexing questions and the still-beating heart of a special creature.Marsh, who made the multi-awarded Man on a Wire, takes no sides but lets the humans speak for themselves, rum lot that they are.You end up fearing for the humans who contact him. At the same time, you feel his rage.The chimp comes out of it well. Homo sapiens, of course, is found wanting.As a cinema experience, Project Nim was never likely to reach the heights of Marsh\\'s Man on Wire, but the eccentricities of his story made it well worth telling.One of the best documentaries of the year.A documentary, stunningly watchable, about the 1970s American research team that explored the \"educability\" of a chimpanzee.You\\'re left with the impression that, despite not being able to grasp basic human grammar, perhaps Nim was unwittingly conditioned into understanding the concept of love.Gripping, heart-wrenching, powerful and a sad indictment of scientific practice, which shows that \\'human\\' and \\'humane\\' are all-too-often mutually exclusive.For the second film in a row, Marsh has created a movie we can\\'t keep our eyes off.Marsh ... masterfully spins a harrowing tale of human arrogance that eventually gives way to cruelty bordering on the pathological. A seriously remarkable documentary-essay from the Chilean filmmaker Patricio Guzmn.This is one of the films of the year.You wait all year for a thought-provoking movie-essay on life, art, science or history. Then in Nostalgia for the Light all four arrive together.Sticking in the mind, Nostalgia for the Light leaves much food for thought on life\\'s important questions.A truly eye-opening experience.A truly insightful art film that still manages to be easy-going and unpretentious.A nearly unbearable examination of good and bad in the human heart.Guzmn offers a poetic narrative that celebrates the searches and insists on the moral obligation to remember Chile\\'s not-too-distant past.The filmmaker\\'s masterpiece, an exquisitely filmed, poetically written meditation on how past and present fuse in humanity\\'s most unresolved questions.A film of rare visual poetry that\\'s simultaneously personal, political and philosophical, it\\'s a genuine art film that\\'s also unpretentious and easygoing.\"I am convinced that memory has gravitational force,\" says Guzmn in conclusion. \"Nostalgia\" states his case so beautifully that even skeptical physicists will be thoroughly convinced.That rare documentary that\\'s as thrilling as art as it is as reportage, a marvelously shaped thesis that\\'s both disquieting and humbling.Katell Djian\\'s stunning cinematography adds to the film\\'s power.The film\\'s passionate insistence on remembrance lends it a moral as well as a metaphysical weight. Mr. Guzmn\\'s belief in eternal memory is an astounding leap of faith.As a work of nonfiction, it deserves its own nomenclature. \"Docu-poem\" is too inelegant; \"masterpiece\" works, although it\\'s been used before.A moving meditation on history, knowledge and mortality.Has the overwhelming power of an outrage to decency.Nostalgia for the Light isn\\'t didactic in the strictest sense. It simply shows the truth, illuminated by [Patricio Guzman]\\'s poetic voiceover narration and the found sound of wind and footsteps that echo across the desert plains.Patricio Guzmn\\'s documentary, Nostalgia for the Light, pays equal attention to the astronomers and searchers, regarding their quest as the same -- a search for life. Narrated by Laurence Fishburne, its in-depth interviews with band members, friends and fellow musicians from the punk/ska scene of the late 1980\\'s make it so you don\\'t have to be a fan of Fishbone to be enthralled by their story.It\\'s a hearty, thoughtful, smartly assembled, vaguely complete documentary about a rock band that, even by the standards of out-there musical acts, seemed out there both in the mid-1980s and even now.It\\'s a movie about what it\\'s like to almost make it in the music business, but not really, not quite. It\\'s about coming close and watching it slip away.What makes this better than the usual Behind the Music-style doc is the frankness of its subjects and the fun way the filmmakers intersperse Fat Albert-style animation to tell their story.Even as a hagiography, though, it\\'s pretty interesting.[It] isn\\'t the happiest movie about a band you\\'ll ever see, but it is one of the more entertaining, and thanks to directors Lev Anderson and Christ Metzler, one of the most original.It seems telling just how many other musicians were willing to participate in the documentary to attest to the outfit\\'s influence.It all comes together for a rollicking chronicle of verve and nerve.Sharp, insightful look at the ups and downs of one of L.A.\\'s most influential alternative bands.The group\\'s influence - attested to by members of No Doubt, the Peppers and Jane\\'s Addiction, among many others - is indisputable.Directors Chris Metzler and Lev Anderson seem to have considered several different approaches for their film and settled on all of them.Effortlessly entertaining.There\\'s just enough uncut truth and soul in Fishbone\\'s story to keep die-hard Boneheads skankin\\' to the beat, even if it\\'s just for nostalgia\\'s sake.Packed with fantastic performance footage, it solidly makes the case that, throughout the \\'80s and early \\'90s, Fishbone was one of rock\\'s best live acts ever -- furiously energetic, innovative, leaping multiple genres in a single song.Many bands have a might-have-been story, but few have a story that reflects such rich and paradoxical ideas.Like their subjects, the directors themselves have attempted an all-over-the-place style--and surprisingly succeeded.Those of us lucky enough to have seen the punk, funk and ska band in a sweaty nightclub might have borrowed a different title: \"Party at Ground Zero.\"Aspires to be more than an episode of Behind the Music and succeeds largely due to the amazing talent of the band it chronicles, the stunning, one-and-only Fishbone. []This affectionate documentary celebrates the veteran photographer who, at 84, still works a tough schedule, taking photos on the street of real people wearing real fashion.Bill Cunningham New York is a minor joy, lurking amid the week\\'s non-fiction.Gives you new perspectives of fashion, photography and New York.He was the first, and what\\'s obvious from this lively and engaging doc, an original.There\\'s few sharp edges or dirt digging, but it\\'s no less engaging for that.Whatever this Times-produced, TV-ready tribute lacks in tension is amply compensated by the pleasure of watching an enthusiast ply the craft he loves.It\\'s not just what he does. It\\'s who he is. And he approaches it with such unbridled passion and joy that you can\\'t help but sharing in it; absolutely no knowledge or love of fashion is required.[A] marvelous documentary.While certainly an affectionate and admiring portrait, Bill Cunningham New York, by its end, provides no revelations and left this viewer, at least, puzzling.Here is a movie about a happy and nice man.Filmmaker Richard Press offers a humorous, touching and insightful portrait about a subject who clearly would have preferred to stay behind the camera.The movie has a refreshing allure that goes beyond fashion, beyond journalism, moving from moment to moment and scene to scene with a remarkable precision that is as emotional as it is fascinating.He finds beauty; watching him, we find joy.Bill Cunningham New York is as winning as its subject, the affable chronicler of New York style from the sidewalk to the runway.Bill Cunningham New York shows us a man who not only derives great pleasure from devoting himself to his job but also, in the process, has helped shaped the greatest city in the world.Cunningham\\'s work is about seeing and teaching us how to see, and that should be plenty for us.Equally at home chronicling the latest fashions on the street and the biggest celebrations among Manhattan\\'s aristocratic swell set, he might as well be the city that forms his vast canvas.It\\'s as much a portrait of a kind of artist as it is a document of a city\\'s evolving sense of style.Cunningham seems genuinely in love with his work... We Were Here does not move behind the scope of San Francisco, which I considered a benefit. It allows the viewer to fully immerse themselves in the story.A simple, powerful act of bearing witness, We Were Here is a sober reminder of the not-too-distant past, when gays were focused not on honeymoon plans but on keeping people alive.Weissman documents the ingenuity, generosity and optimism of a community that fell victim to a horrible disease that, with astonishing speed, turned the world inside out.Even if, understandably, it\\'s a little inward-looking (the ongoing disaster in Africa gets barely a mention), as a slice of social history, We Were Here takes an invigoratingly positive position on a very gloomy time.[]An honest, frank and often moving documentary that deals with its difficult subject matter sensitively and compellingly.[A] sober, devastating film about how we all - and some more than others - have to deal with the most unexpected horrors in our lives.A moving look behind the curtain of a rarely-explored community.There\\'s something profoundly inspirational about this portrait of a community coming together to battle prejudice and disease.\"We Were Here\" pays eloquent homage to men and women who deserve to be celebrated and remembered as heroes.The filmmakers have amassed an amazing archive of photos and videotapes, but it is the intimate, personal testimonies that make the film so vital, urgent, and necessary.The most gripping war movie you\\'ll see this year, We Were Here tells first-hand the story of how AIDS attacked San Francisco, killing more than 15,000. Whole peer groups were happy, healthy, and then dead in months.It is both a testament to the fallen and a series of life lessons from five brave survivors, lessons about finding the best in ourselves in the worst of times.Its vivid, no-nonsense style (in which interviews, period photographs, and news footage merge seamlessly) makes the past present.This clear-eyed and soulful documentary brings us inside the contagion in a way that is so intimate, so personal, you feel like you\\'re hearing about these catastrophic events for the first time.Director David Weissman does everything you\\'re generally not supposed to do in a documentary - we get talking heads, old news footage, and still photographs, and that\\'s about it - but We Were Here is never less than riveting.An extraordinarily moving, beautifully edited documentary...We Were Here utilizes an invaluable archive of period pictures and news footage to trace how the Castro went from Edenic neighborhood to an epidemic frontline.A simple, powerful act of bearing witness, We Were Here is a sober reminder of the not-too-distant past, when gays were focused not on honeymoon plans but on keeping people alive.A harrowing oral history of the AIDS epidemic in San Francisco whose spine is the freshly recounted horror of an \"avalanche\" of grief. The result is more than an examination of the contradictory life of the celebrated humorist and storyteller, it\\'s a compelling cinematic look at the complex world of Eastern European Jews.Not often does a film double as a literary critic, but this is the Northrop Frye of docs. Essentially, it revises and sharpens the blunted reputation of a great writer.Audiences interested in Jewish literature will find Laughing in the Darkness compelling for its deep analysis of Aleichem\\'s works, featuring a selection of experts and the writer\\'s granddaughter, Bel Kaufman.[An] absorbing PBS-style documentary.Throughout the film, Dorman uses ethnographic and silent-cinema footage, along with ubiquitous klezmer music, to paint a picture of the era.A rich, winning documentary...The film adroitly sets the writer\\'s works, his triumphs and tribulations, against the backdrop of a tumultuous period for European Jewry.Dorman makes the case that Aleichem is the source from whence flows modern Jewish humor.This is a person you\\'d enjoy spending time with and learning from. That\\'s certainly the case with Dorman\\'s film.Wonderfully rich, like one of Tevye\\'s monologues, Joseph Dorman\\'s \"Sholem Aleichem: Laughing in the Darkness\" captures the spirit of a man and his times.There are many scholars and critics here, most of them useful and pleasant, who obviously love him.There\\'s much more to Aleichem the man and the writer than just the musings of a milkman.A highly accessible and sharply drawn film.Joseph Dorman\\'s intelligent if conventional bio-doc of Sholem Aleichem proves particularly revealing, since the famed, dandyish Yiddish writer led a life as full of colorful ironies as the motormouth schlemiels that populate his stories.It is a rich, beautifully organized and illustrated modern history of Eastern European Jewry examined through the life and work of the author, born Sholem Rabinovich in Pereyaslav (near Kiev) in 1859.Starts off looking like a glorified DVD extra for \"Fiddler on the Roof,\" but it eventually becomes a far more gemutlich portrait of the creator of Tevye the Milkman, who took the pen name of Sholem Aleichem.In the spirit of the Sholem Aleichem oeuvre, Laughing in the Darkness is a collective family album.The equation of biography and literary output never feels overly schematic, thanks to the range of intelligent voices on hand to explain the richness and deeper significance of Aleichem\\'s deceptively simple tales. Herzog has used the 3D process with tremendous creativity to make this very beautiful film.This is what 3-D was made for, puncturing the proscenium and taking us somewhere \\'\\'not yet offended\\'\\'.It is our tour guide that makes Cave of Forgotten Dreams an often thrilling experience.The overall effect, aided by Ernst Reijseger\\'s score of rising choral harmonies and lush strings, is rapturous.Herzog\\'s glimpses of the future can be as otherworldly and singular as his perspective on the past.To call \"Cave of Forgotten Dreams\" a great movie isn\\'t just an understatement, it\\'s a wildly inaccurate way to describe an experience that, in its immersive sensory pleasures and climactic journey of discovery, more closely resembles an ecstatic trance.This is something more than a movie; it\\'s a testament - and re-creation - of rapture.Art history lessons don\\'t get much better: \"Cave of Forgotten Dreams\" presents the world\\'s oldest paintings captured by one of film\\'s great visionaries.What we get from this film: a specific and personal sense that 32,000-year-old artists, with all their ideas and passions, were not, fundamentally, that different from us.We\\'re never going to be allowed in this place, so thanks, Werner, for inviting us along.What we come to love about Herzog\\'s documentary is Herzog\\'s love itself.Herzog\\'s voiceover is, as always, more entertaining than most film soundtracks. The film has a touch of that gray fuzz which still afflicts 3-D, but the Chauvet cave is a perfect candidate for such technology, because it stashes its secrets in a recess.Herzog is reaching for ways to comprehend what he imagines to be the emblems of the birth of the modern soul.While the handheld 3D did at times make me a little queasy, over all using this method to bring the Chauvet Cave to life adds another layer of detail the movie would not have achieved otherwise.Calling Werner Herzog\\'s latest film a documentary is both a misstatement and an understatement. Like Grizzly Man and Conversations at the End of the World, it filters its raw material through the prism of Herzog\\'s...The result is a journey to prehistory that\\'s simultaneously wondrous and tedious, profound and completely nuts -- which is to say, quintessential Herzog.Working with extremely limited lighting, Herzog not only gives a sense of the caves as a sinuous, tactile environment, but focuses on the movement suggested by the paintings.Director Werner Herzog\\'s latest cinematic mind trip blows you away with its beauty, though not necessarily due to its exquisite use of 3-D.The unknowable or the mysteriously ambiguous in human behavior is what sets Mr. Herzog\\'s synapses to firing with singular intensity.If you\\'re interested in the history of the human race -- if you\\'re a member of the human race -- you owe it to yourself to see this movie. One way or another you\\'ll find yourself saying, \"Awwwwww.\"A terrific big-screen/3D film about the rescue of baby elephants and orangutans by dedicated humans introduces young people to a strong conservation ethic.Few will be unmoved by the two women\\'s courage and persistence, though Morgan Freeman\\'s intoning voiceover is less persuasive.A nice family outing, this, but those after an in-depth discussion had better look elsewhere.There are three certainties in life: death, taxes, and Morgan Freeman\\'s voice.I\\'m a fan of the diorama approach [to 3D], but Born to Be Wild makes the case that a nature documentary in IMAX 3D can and perhaps should bring us as close to the action as possible.A decent weekend diversion, this IMAX documentary is cute enough to engage your kids, while teaching them the most basic lessons in ecological responsibility.Their stories are touching and inspiring, but let\\'s face it, the visuals are what make this movie. Born to be Wild takes you to places you\\'ve never been and makes you wish you had.The hip soundtrack adds momentum, and the reassuring narration of Morgan Freeman lets us know these lucky orphans will have a fighting chance for survival after taking their first steps -- or swings -- back into the wild.Given the sheer scale of the format, Imax provides an ideal context in which to experience 3D, allowing the eyes to wander about each periphery-filling frame and focus on whatever catches our interest, the way we do in the real world.While there\\'s an important story here - how these two women take in endangered animals with the intention of later releasing them back into the wild - the main attraction is the general adorableness.It\\'s sort of poetic justice that the wretched \"Sucker Punch\" is getting kicked off four Manhattan IMAX screens after just two weeks by this charming nature documentary.\"Born to be Wild\" is a good nature film - and a great technical achievement.A moving, engaging and revelatory IMAX attraction with two heroines and a crowd of charming beasts.Although it runs just a fleet 40 minutes, the film proves a rich and memorable journey.Wholesome and educational, teaches right from wrong, and brings up some important environmental issues.Some animal parts, it turns out, are perfectly suited to 3-D, none more so than an elephant\\'s trunk.An honest marketer might have just gone ahead and titled the film \"Awwwww.\\'\\'Born to be Wild is both grand spectacle and intimate tale.Everything a family movie should be: touching, funny and inspiring. Pina is a celebration of what it is to inspire greatness, a passionate dance of life, love and inspiration that transcends its central figure to become something as timeless, and as hopeful, as the innovative and remarkable woman who inspired it.Watching Pina is like being inside one of Bausch\\'s surreal pieces.A remarkable -- and likely enduring -- tribute to an artist committed to creating dance theater drawn from humanity\\'s deepest physical and emotional reserves.[An] utterly transfixing, exhilarating spectacle of bodies in motion.\"Pina\" isn\\'t just for dance fans or those curious about the latest in 3-D. It\\'s a celebration of life.A unique and often sublime artistic experience, \"Pina\" is a 3-D dance film that immerses us in the movement, letting us feel that we could reach out and touch these dancers as they float past us.For anyone with an interest in dance, \"Pina\" is a must-see. For anyone not interested in contemporary dance, \"Pina\" is a should-see. It could change your mind.Pina is a tribute of an artist by an artist, a friend to a friend. But its great genius comes from the mournful, as well as celebratory, reckoning of the performers Bausch pushed, collaborated with and inspired.What might seem like a convenient bid for publicity - the first 3-D art-house film! - turns out to be the only logical way to showcase the action.This meditation on movement and space, transportation and transcendence is not to be missed.What the filmmaker has created is an inspired simulacrum - a jewel-box that contains more of Bausch\\'s kinetic soul than film has any right to.Crane and steadycam allow Wenders to get so close to the action that in the minimalist Caf Mller, one\\'s illusion of being on stage is uncanny.\"Pina\"is the best possible tribute to Bausch, and to adventurous image-making.I watched the film in a sort of reverie.An exhilarating experience, both in its celebration of Bausch\\'s groundbreaking work and in the thrilling way that Wenders captures it on camera.Whether you\\'re familiar with Pina Bausch\\'s work or not, the new film \"Pina\" is a knockout.So this is what 3-D is capable of when used for art rather than the commerce of hiking ticket prices and repurposing cartoons!Pina is, in every way, a moving experience.[]It should appeal to dance mavens, and to folks who have no idea what a pas de deux is. More than 100 million Elmo owners can\\'t be wrong, can they?He seems like a genuinely nice celebrity, possibly because he is never recognised in the street.He simply seems to be a good guy who created something that little children love. Fair enough.What a terrific bunch of guys the Muppets/Sesame Street creators are, not just spiritually, but technically.Slight, but an uplifting, universal rallying call for creative people to follow their dreams.Constance Marks\\'s film is a simple cut-and-paste job, drawing on new interviews and archive, but what it lacks in refinement it makes up for in infectious warmth.A charming, if occasionally surface-deep look at the man behind the fur. Elmo like![Clash is] portrayed as a mild-mannered, kind, giving, supremely talented soul, with a deep love for the puppet he animates and the children who love him.Despite an exhaustive series of interviews with famous puppeteers and a few celebs (among them Whoopi Goldberg, who also narrates), it\\'s a documentary that feels a bit tedious by journey\\'s end.Being Elmo: A Puppeteer\\'s Journey\" is the story of a young man who knew what he wanted to do and did it, who made his dreams real. This may be the most truly American movie in memory.Watching Clash realize his dream is gratifying, and the behind-the-scenes Muppets stuff is fun.It serves as an object lesson in the ultimate power of believing in oneself and persevering against long odds and ridicule from others.Backstage at the Muppet works, we see countless drawers filled with eyeballs, eyebrows, whiskers and wigs. It\\'s the only world Kevin wanted to live in, and he made it.The film also provides an inspiring reminder for the young and the rest of us that there is a vital relationship between the best kind of work and passionate play.The most interesting part of this lively, likable documentary is the journey.The film is filled with so much insider Muppet lore that, at times, it strains even the goodwill that Clash generates.A marvelous movie.A documentary as gentle as its subject: the story of a boy who realized his dream and, on the film\\'s evidence, received a lot of encouragement and support along the way.\"Kevin comes alive through Elmo,\" says Clash\\'s mother in the film, and it\\'s true. Watching him manipulate the puppet for adoring children, a kindness and joy shines through.It is, like Sesame Street, a captivating story for viewers of all ages. Even those unfamiliar with cherry-red Elmo will immediately fall under his spell. This is not just a good film - it\\'s a great film: fascinating, exciting, nerve-wracking and profoundly moving.Captivating, chilling, and surprisingly sublime.\"Senna\" is simply the greatest sports film I have ever seen.A psychologically intriguing if at times too hagiographic portrait of a man who often held pole position in his profession and felt nearer to God because of it.Undeniably gripping stuff.\"Senna\" is carefully edited and makes sometimes spectacular use of extensive home movies and videos.You don\\'t have to know anything about car racing at all. Instead, you simply have to like a great story, one that has all the elements: drama, inspiration, competition, victory, defeat, betrayal and, looming above it all, tragedy.It\\'s stripped of narration, talking heads, and anything else that might threaten to slow it down.Even if you can\\'t tell Formula One from Grecian Formula, Senna is pretty exciting stuff.Most interesting for the way its construction builds on the inherent austerity of auto racing.Real life eclipses fiction in delivering a tale that combines heroism, villainy, suspense and a surprising amount of emotional resonance.What makes \"Senna\" essential viewing is the propulsive education it provides in one of the world\\'s most popular sports, and the introduction it provides to an extraordinary athlete and human being.The new documentary Senna has all the full-throttle momentum and sweeping emotion any big-budget feature could hope for.Kapadia is working with an embarrassment of riches, but to his credit he selects wisely, and has the good sense to keep the talking heads off the screen.Senna feels a touch too short to be fully realized -- but then again, so was Ayrton Senna\\'s life.Senna is earnest, eloquent, and impossibly charismatic, and his rocketing ascension through the ranks of professional drivers - gunning his car at more than 200 m.p.h. down the straightaways - is something to behold.The movie\\'s assemblage of audio interviews poured mostly over astounding race footage is fit for a shrine.Plays like a narrative feature, juicy and alive, with enough kinetic excitement to hook the Formula One-ignorant (me, I knew next to nothing about the subject), let alone racing fans worldwide.\"Senna\" is a documentary that does the job it sets out to do. I wish it had tried for more.There are some thrilling you-are-there sequences shot inside the racing car from his POV as he zooms around the tracks. It\\'s like watching a video game made real. Operates as both an examination of the dominating media mentality at the time and an embodiment of it, no less keen on delving into the juicy details now as tabloid rags were then.Morris suggests that you can sometimes find profundity in triviality - and though Joyce condemns herself out of her own mouth, it is always possible to feel sorry for a woman whose obsession has so totally ruled her life.[]A vivid picture of the way we lived then.McKinney is no Robert McNamara, but there are lessons to be learned from this fog of sleaze.Morris\\'s doc is less about What Really Happened than exploring the lifespan of one of those stories that kept on giving.[Morris] tells us nothing about the prurience and gutter morality of the tabloid newspaper industry that Britons haven\\'t heard every day and that the world, in the Murdochgate era, is now hearing likewise.This is a lighter, less significant work than his \\'Standard Operating Procedure\\' or \\'The Fog of War\\', but it\\'s engrossing and pleasingly slippery with the facts.A compelling story told with Morris\\'s usual flair.A lot of fun; Morris himself is clearly unconvinced about Joyce -- and no wonder -- but she\\'s a funny woman and hers is a ripping yarn if ever there was one.[]Errol Morris is a genius, a gifted documentarian who has made better movies than \"Tabloid,\" but none so entertaining.Morris has found a real character in McKinney, but to what end, I couldn\\'t say.\"Tabloid\" is tantalizing, but like yesterday\\'s headlines, it\\'s a fleeting flirtation.Though the events Tabloid recounts took place in the pre-digital age, the film also functions as a kind of prehistory of modern celebrity culture and tabloid journalism.Morris\\'s subject is sexual fantasy and a particular kind of American stupidity-the ability to substitute self-justification for self-knowledge. His tone is merry.McKinney is of course the star, insisting that her version of events is the true one and that everyone else has some sort of axe to grind and doesn\\'t know what they\\'re talking about.It is quite simply one of the craziest stories ever told, made all the crazier by the fact that it\\'s true. Or at least some version of it is true.Tabloid, Errol Morris\\' latest wild and woolly portrait of human self-delusion, is a scandal-sheet dream come to life.The movie is guilty of condescending toward its subjects, though most of them appear to be having a fabulous time telling tales. Into the Abyss is not just a compelling documentary about a convicted murderer on Death Row, but a further chapter in Werner Herzog\\'s obsessive exploration of the American way of life - and death.The star filmmaker, oft mocked for verging on self-parody, keeps his Teutonic explorer persona in check and allows his subjects\\' emotional outpourings-sadness, shame, dread, and desperation, and unexpected glimmers of hope and happiness-to set the tone.It\\'s a decent film, though I felt that a clearer, sharper light could have been cast on the defendants themselves.The extensive use of lurid crime scene videos and subtitles set in a naff typewriter font sit uneasily with the director\\'s opposition to capital punishment.When Tolstoy said all unhappy families are unhappy in their own ways, perhaps he was thinking of Texas. But even he reckoned without the rich, extraordinary complexities of unhappiness chronicled in Herzog\\'s film.Moving and thought-provoking in equal measure. A Herzog doc of the highest order.The result is gripping, moving and revelatory, an unabashed if implicit critique of the death penalty.[]A haunting portrayal of people who are neither completely innocent nor wholly evil, and the terrible price of killing, whether in the pursuit of a sports car or in the name of justice.[]Herzog is pursuing no agenda with Into the Abyss, despite his opposition to extreme judicial measures. He\\'s seeking to answer the question of why people kill, especially in a situation such as this where the reason for the murders was so meaningless.Into the Abyss does what too few documentaries these days do - it gives ample play to all sides of the argument. Herzog allows us to think things through on our own.The overriding point of Into the Abyss, what keeps this sad, sorrowful film from becoming depressing and elevates it far above the usual chatter of liberal-conservative debate, is that there can be light on the other end of even the darkest of tunnels.The title Into the Abyss could serve for any of Werner Herzog\\'s documentaries, but this portrait of death row inmate Michael Perry is perhaps the least Herzogian film in his nonfiction catalogue.\"Into the Abyss\" makes a strong case for the inhumanity of capital punishment, regardless of the crime or the criminal.Herzog\\'s investigation may not work as an anti-death-penalty editorial, but its findings are undeniably profound.A disquieting, heartbreaking look at American crime and punishment.The abyss here isn\\'t capital punishment, the ostensible subject of the film; it\\'s the seemingly unending capacity for causing and enduring pointless misery that humans seem to have.Herzog is an eloquent interviewer/documentarian. Yet his technically flawless film leaves you reeling emotionally even as you wonder why, and why now, he\\'s turned his lens on the American way of crime and punishment.It\\'s an uneven movie, but a heartfelt and honest one. A deeply unsettling experience.[]As Palmer rightly shows, there\\'s plenty of heart and soul (rough-and-tumble though it may be) beneath the acres of scar tissue on display here.Palmer\\'s film is brutally compelling to look at, as the lads get down to face-rearranging, but it also carries a lot of tragic historical freight.While it\\'s frustrating that Mr. Palmer doesn\\'t dig deep into the complexities of the fights, one of the movie\\'s strengths is the honesty with which he confesses his doubts about them.Though you will wish for more polish and insight, its unruly action is hard to resist.Knuckle largely skirts exploitation, simply by virtue of showing this conflict perpetuate itself over so many years. Clans like the Quinn McDonaghs and the Joyces seem destined to fight for generations after they\\'ve forgotten their rationale.While the film becomes slightly redundant, the anger and strife its characters cannot overcome is awful, poetic and, frankly, astonishing.Knuckle is a documentary about feuding families of Irish Travelers who settle their grudges with bare-knuckle boxing matches, so it\\'s bound to be inherently fascinating, regardless of how well it\\'s assembled.Knuckle is a curiously riveting work.Simply showing generations of pasty, fat men pounding each other to a pulp shouldn\\'t be mistaken for an in-depth exploration of Gaelic machismo...Palmer\\'s grainy, handheld camerawork won\\'t win any aesthetic prizes, but it\\'s in tune with his subject.A documentary of bareknuckle fights among feuding Irish Traveller clans can\\'t give the participants\\' self-perpetuating, dead-end rivalry the scope of tragedy.As a bruising study in masculine temperament and the ways in which cycles of violence can be controlled and mediated -- yet also perpetuated and inflamed -- in a public arena, pic is unavoidably compelling stuff.Chock full of larger-than-life characters, it\\'s an enthralling insight into a raw, bloodied world.This is the slightly daft tale of warring Irish travellers whose feuding is partially ameliorated by bare-knuckle fighting - no biting, head-butting or below the belt punches allowed.A black comedy without the comedy.Knuckle tells you more than you ever wanted to know - in my case, not much - about family feuding and bare-knuckle fighting among Irish travellers.Palmer, who compiled this material over a decade, admits to his own cumulative discomfort with what he\\'s been shooting, and Knuckle gains power from this unconsidered air of queasiness - you want it to stop.Knuckle is often like Waiting for Godot, only bloodier. By resisting the impulse to let present-day moralists tamp the story into safe hindsight shape... it allows us to glimpse rawer and more remarkable elements of mutual transformation in real time.Olsson includes material that might typically have been considered outtakes and lets clips play at length, reinforcing an impression of intimacy with the participants in the scene.Broken into nine chapters -- one for each year -- the documentary isn\\'t a rigorous work but a felt piece of vital, if flawed, art.It\\'s thrilling to hear from unrepentant revolutionaries such as Angela Davis and amusing to hear from their bell-bottomed white lawyers.The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975 is not your standard documentary dealing with racism in America.The timing of this release is more than perfect. And the story behind the film is nearly as interesting as the stories it tells.It is not a comprehensive history but the footage is an extraordinarily potent reminder that the stand taken by black people eventually bore fruit.Interesting stuff, though it sometimes looks like a block of unedited raw material.Blazing interviews with Angela Davis and Stokely Carmichael supply stinging and unforgettable rhetoric: it simply can\\'t fail with footage this wild.Like the era it represents, there are highs and lows.The film is testament to the power of archival legwork in documentary-filmmaking.While it assumes a fair bit of knowledge of the social changes exploding in sixties America, there\\'s a wealth of fascinating material and punchy insights into an earth shaking movement.From the fly-on-the-wall, cinma-vrit style of the \\'60s to a more aggressive, advocacy approach in the mid-\\'70s, \"Mixtape\" is a wide slice of nonfiction film history.A film that suffers from a surfeit of credulity.You watch the material here and wonder whether most of the movies made about black people are meant to pacify general audiences, to distract them from demanding more of the movies.It is mostly impressionistic - but, wow, some of those impressions really pack a punch.This chronicle of pride and social upheaval is filled with vintage images and important voices.The Black Power Mixtape includes plenty of interest, but it would be stronger if the filmmakers had dug a little deeper into the footage from 1967 to 1972 and skipped the final years altogether.You are left in a bracing state of confusion, wondering how much has changed and how the change took place.Because Olsson is working exclusively with film shot by other people, with their own 40-year-old agenda, he loses some of what decades of reflection, reconsideration, and historical context could\\'ve brought. Like many of the 400-odd movies Roger Corman has produced and/or directed, Corman\\'s World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel has a title that sizzles over content that merely simmers.None of it gets us anywhere truly close to the beating heart of an essentially retiring figure.A frustrating documentary about a frustrating man.A supremely watchable documentary-tribute to the exploitation king Roger Corman.The results are solid and educative.Alex Stapleton\\'s lively, engrossing and enlightening documentary about a career that can be described as surprising on multiple counts.As far as hagiographies go, Corman\\'s World is breezy and entertaining enough to be absorbing, especially for the uninitiated.The movie delivers a compelling argument for appreciating the filmmaker as a major artist who\\'s both largely responsible for many mainstream Hollywood cinema trends while somehow remaining superior to them.To fresh eyes, Corman\\'s World may feel more like a meal; to the rest of us, it\\'s merely a glance at the menu.It\\'s nice to see the greatest hits, and to listen to Corman\\'s refined paternal baritone as he talks about his work.The funniest thing about Corman -- it\\'s a joke he\\'s in on -- is the disparity between the movies he makes and the precise, polite, almost scholarly demeanor he projects.An excellent introduction to a director equally adept at following his own vision and nurturing those of others.A movie about Roger Corman should kind of look like a Roger Corman movie - fast and cheap and a little battered around the edges. And entertaining as hell.Though many fans don\\'t know it, Corman\\'s taste runs to foreign-language films, and in the \\'80s he produced work by Bergman, Fellini and Antonioni.A highly entertaining tribute to Roger Corman, one of Hollywood\\'s most prolific, enduring and unconventionally influential film producers.His films may have been disreputable, but the picture that emerges in this documentary is of a decent, loyal and sensible man who has spent his life making marvelous trash and sowing the seeds of art.It\\'s the typical, from-the-archives, scrapbook approach that makes Corman\\'s World the safe bet that it is.It\\'s an exuberant valentine to a man with the uptight exterior of a junior bank president and the incorrigible soul of a carnie as well as a tribute to getting art, or at least entertainment, made by any means necessary...The subject\\'s legacy, rather than his currency, is the real story here.A delightful tribute. Meehl roots this redemption tale in carefully observed demonstrations at his clinics, even as the gorgeously shot landscape reminds us why stories like this are Hollywood\\'s very lifebloodThere\\'s a whole heap of Americana to wallow in here, but it\\'s testimony to the director and subject that Buck still trots along at such a lick.An unforgettable film about an extraordinary man.Singular in style and impressively reflective of its protagonist\\'s nature. Universal in theme, but may struggle to find a wide audience.If you have even a passing interest in horses, you may find yourself smitten with this meditative doc.[]A touching, if occasionally overwrought look at the inspiration behind Robert Redford\\'s Horse Whisperer.Cynics beware: Darned tootin\\', we\\'re home on the range here, where seldom is heard a discouraging word and don\\'t nobody be yappin\\' that Buck is too good to be true.Interviews with horse people, Brannaman\\'s very funny, elderly stepmother and director Robert Redford help round out the doc, but all we really need is time with Brannaman, and Meehl doesn\\'t disappoint.The result is a portrait that expertly mirrors its subject: Buck is shaped with the same economy, restraint, and unfussiness as the man, to unexpectedly inspiring effect.Transcendent, emotional, moving, informative and ethereal, this surprisingly tough-minded look at a man and his life\\'s work is a wonderful excursion that says just as much about the viewer as it does about the figure at the center of it all.Meehl\\'s documentary features plenty of interviews with cowboys and ranch hands who\\'ve had their lives changed by Brannaman, but it lacks the literary or cinematic magic of either version of The Horse Whisperer.It\\'s well and good to hear Buck and others tell his story, but the film wouldn\\'t come to much if you didn\\'t feel the connection between his present and past in every frame.You don\\'t have to be a horse nut to fall for \"Buck,\" one of those rare documentaries whose subject is so inherently fascinating that a fictional character could hardly compete.Beautifully but simply wrought by director Cindy Meehl, this deft documentary is a poignant reappraisal of what it means to be human.Documentaries have a wonderful way of making us care about people and things way outside our own experience, and \"Buck\" is a prime example.Never has the special relationship between people and horses appeared more magnificent and even lyrical on film than in \"Buck.\"Brannaman is a fascinating character, but Buck is so tightly focused that only avid horse lovers will find it appealing.The man\\'s mythology precedes him, and it\\'s the movie\\'s failing that we don\\'t understand how or whether he uses that mythology because he knows it\\'s good business.What I was left with was the goodness of Buck Brannaman as a man. This authorized documentary is more of a celebration of the legendary Queens quartet than a serious exploration of their art. But considering how brilliant they were at their peak, it\\'s hard to disagree with the general sentiment.Rapaport gets at the dynamics of a group that struggles even now to get along well enough to get paid - again.Despite accusations of nearly succumbing to spotlighting beefs over beats, the film comes off as an honest representation of a great group that\\'s not to be forgotten.A combination of timing, access, a visual aesthetic that reflects ATCQ\\'s Afrocentric \"surface philosophy\" (as the crew\\'s look is described) and, most importantly, story-conscious editing elevates the doc above the norm.Thanks to a particularly even-handed job by director Michael Rapaport, the story emerges as compelling, even for non-fans in the audience.Good vibes propel what is a fairly straightforward account of the band\\'s formation, album output, and acrimonious breakup.The movie gets the beats and rhymes down pat, but the life part is a little messy. Oh well, two out of three ain\\'t bad.There\\'s nothing new about the bickering between lead rappers Q-Tip and Phife, or their redundant breakup-and-reunion cycle. It helps that these lyricists are our key narrators, so at least they add wit and humour to their brief history.There are scenes toward the end of the movie that hint at a fuzzier tomorrow for Tribe, but you leave appreciating the music as it was, not hoping for anything else.The emotional honesty Rapaport captures on screen comes off as real, a cut above standard-issue Behind the Music drama in terms of believability.Somewhat against the odds, Rapaport manages to parlay his access and sycophancy into the plaint of a concerned fan: Please, fellas, squash this.Even as the band implodes, \"Beats\" flows as smoothly as Q-Tip on \"Verses From the Abstract.\" It\\'s the tension between the group\\'s core members that really propels the film forward.An outstanding effort, and one of the more honest band biopics in recent years.Rapaport smartly focuses on the yin-and-yang duo of Q-Tip and Phife Dawg, the group\\'s lead rappers, and a fascinating study in contrasts.A reminder, part \"Behind the Music\" and part something better, that even artists professing love and togetherness have a hard time keeping it going.Rapaport, a longtime Quest fan, clearly admires Tip. He\\'s just too forthright a storyteller to bury the tale of the quartet\\'s acrimonious unraveling.Even those who never joined the cult of A Tribe Called Quest will find this clear-eyed chronicle of their career irresistible.Rapaport, in his feature directorial debut, does an admirable job recounting the group\\'s formation and dissecting its dissolution.\"Beats, Rhymes & Life\" is a must for hip-hop heads. Others will either be won over or left wondering what all the fuss is about.But unlike so many movies about the rise and fall of successful bands, this one manages to capture the thrill of discovery that A Tribe Called Quest enjoyed, at least in their early years. Lets the soldiers tell their stories by the way they live day-to-day during their tour of duty.When the bombs go off and the bullets start flying, Metz and his cameraman provide a real-life vision of what a hurt locker is really all about.It\\'s alluring to watch.The movie\\'s strength and audacity comes from the Danish soldiers, who confront civilians with wariness or bluntness, exalt in their victories and hesitantly exhibit fear in each others\\' company.There\\'s little new in \"Armadillo.\"A mesmerizing, beautiful and terrifying documentary that can stand among the greatest war movies ever made.You emerge shaken and bothered, which may sound like a reason not to see the movie. It is actually the opposite.What\\'s interesting about Armadillo\\'s subjects is how differently they and their American counterparts perceive the war...Facile documentaries like this one, no matter how sincere their intentions may be, don\\'t help the case.It\\'s a sickening but stunning portrait of combat that looks past notions of bravery or brutality, guilt or innocence, to bear witness to a thoroughly besieged humanity.While much of Armadillo echoes last year\\'s Restrepo, the unprecedented access of director Janus Metz and cameraman Lars Skree reveals the alternating waves of frontline tedium and terror with fresh immediacy.It took great courage for Janus Metz and Lars Skree to make Armadillo - first to shoot it under such conditions and then to present the material in this non-judgmental manner.Janus Metz\\'s project is certain to prove far more revelatory to his fellow countrymen than it will when it makes its stateside debut.Could be the most honest film about military combat ever made. And one of the best, too, focusing as it does on the effects of battle on front-line soldiers in a futile war.The film-makers evidently risked their lives alongside these soldiers, and it\\'s a further mark of their courage that they retained their detachment.A remarkable documentary that was filmed in life-threateningly dangerous circumstances and brings military conflict to nerve-shredding, horribly intimate life.Whether or not these elements can be taken together in good taste is for the viewer to decide, but the experience of watching Armadillo is a gut-wrenching and memorable one.Metz calculates perfectly the distance to keep from his material: not too close, not too far, the exact point in space where compassion can merge with critique.What Metz gives us is an unusually intimate portrait of the cycle of arrival, survival and departure experienced by soldiers on a six-month tour of duty.Moving, complex and brutal, it\\'s an outstanding film about men at war. A once-in-a-lifetime character makes for a fascinating documentary subject in producer-director Liz Garbus\\' \"Bobby Fischer Against the World.\"Liz Garbus\\'s documentary about the great American chess champion Bobby Fischer does its level best to avoid the easy clich?? equating madness and genius, except that, in the case of Fischer, the clich?? apparently holds up.Tactfully but strongly posits a connection between the genius he brought to an infinitely complex game and the madness that defined his relationship to just about everything else.Supplies a cracked, conflicted genius trapped in his ceaseless endgame.Garbus handles this decline with tact. The sorry spectacle of the ranting codger never effaces the image of the boy concentrating his entire being over a chessboard. You have to love that kid and pity him.This is strong and effective documentary filmmaking, but it\\'s only a lengthy prologue to the story on which Liz Garbus clearly wants to focus.It\\'s a sad story of genius paying for the gift.Bobby Fischer Against The World could be six times as long and still have you on the edge of your seat.A mesmerising documentary about the world chess champion and later world-class paranoiac...Paints a portrait of a sad genius who grew up alienated and grew old alienating many of the people who admired and might have helped him.Chess! What is it good for? Perhaps a television documentary instead.With its fascinating interview footage and tremendous black-and-white still photographs by Harry Benson, who was permitted great access to Fischer, this is an intriguing portrait. Its pessimism makes it a difficult watch.Overall, the film lacks that precise hook of exactly why it\\'s worth telling this story now, but it remains a fascinating story nonetheless.A compelling look at the tragic and bizarre life of an enigmatic champion.The real battle pitted Bobby Fischer against Bobby Fischer, and this documentary is a revealing account of the many skirmishes in that enduring civil war.How did Fischer rise so high and then tumble so far? Garbus doesn\\'t pretend to have all the answers, but she shines light into dark corners.The film is no flop, but this is based solely on the subject matter being inherently fascinating.Assembly is brisk and high-grade, allowing for the variable quality of archival materials.Another quality picture for HBO Documentaries. Director David Gelb gives us a portrait of a man with a passion. It\\'s about what it takes to find your ambition and work relentlessly at it day after day, year after year. And what is the price of that perfection?At 81 minutes it could do with being still more bite-sized but it\\'s a must-see morsel for foodies. Eat first - it\\'ll make you ravenous.Ono may be the center of this universe, but the real star of the film is the sushi, and the exquisite yet frustrating beauty with which the camera has captured it.David Gelb\\'s affectionate documentary ...A beautiful ode to an artisan and his culture.Jiro Ono\\'s exacting standards have earned him three Michelin stars, but it\\'s his taciturn nature that spices and sours this documentary.The themes of age and appalling loss give the film a freakishly affecting lyricism.Jiro Dreams of Sushi sets a drool-flecked new standard in food porn, and makes the moanings and gruntings of Nigella Lawson look softcore by comparison.The exquisite nigiri slices gleam with freshness, and you do learn about the component parts to the perfect serving of sea eel or gizzard shad.It\\'s torture to watch Jiro Dreams of Sushi -- if you are on an empty stomach.Treating his seafood substantially better than Oldboy, Jiro is a miracle of perfectionism married to expertise. The same can said for Gelb\\'s loving documentary.Gelb apparently understood that his subject was itself so taking that he wouldn\\'t need filmic embellishments to keep his viewers alert.Obsessive, we were saying? Oh my, yes, and that\\'s what makes the film so compelling.This documentary strikes a balance between storytelling and food porn that\\'s hard to come by in foodie flicks. Like a proper sushi meal, \"Jiro\" left me feeling sated, not stuffed.The most interesting moments, however, belong not to the chef but to those who labor in his shadow.As exhausting as Jiro may be, he\\'s also inspiring.Would you be willing to massage an octopus for 45 minutes, until its flesh possesses just the right amount of chewability? Jiro is.I really wish Tokyo were closer.As a documentary about world-class sushi, this film is definitive. It runs only 81 minutes, but the subject is finite.A case study in the phenomenon of mastery. The Invisible War is as compelling as Silence in the House of God, Alex Gibney\\'s study of abusive Catholic priests.Kirby Dick\\'s typically insightful and compassionate documentary presents a harrowing picture of an epidemic of sexual assault and rape within the US military.The film works both as advocacy and as a very moving study of women (and one or two men) whose idealism and patriotism have been utterly shattered.What calibre of male personnel is the military attracting? And how will this dysfunction affect its relations with foreign civilian populations? It is a grim picture.Tears are not hard evidence, but they are hard to resist as anecdotal testimony.I can hardly wait to see which closet Dick will throw open next.A must-see expos?? of the abuse of power in an institution that is supposed to serve and protect.I have rarely been more righteously riled up than I was while watching the documentary The Invisible War.Interview after interview, statistic after statistic, Dick\\'s advocacy project thoroughly incenses -- and appears to be having results.This travesty has been encouraged by a military culture that blames the victim and a policy directing soldiers to refer complaints to their commanding officer, which typically results in no action or even reprisals against those speaking out.Even if you do not see this movie yourself, please encourage any young woman you know who is considering enlistment to watch this movie first.One of those documentaries that you watch both fascinated and repulsed - and one of those films that you sense just might be instrumental in helping to change an utterly unacceptable status quo.\"The Invisible War\" makes all too clear that the military isn\\'t very good at justice.One hearing noted that the victim was dressed provocatively. In her official uniform.If it doesn\\'t make you angry, you\\'re not human.For sheer infuriation value, you can\\'t do much better than Kirby Dick\\'s quietly scathing documentary on rape in the US military.Dick, whose films include a revealing expose about the movie industry\\'s film ratings board, has created yet another galvanizing call to action with \"The Invisible War.\"What happened to these women after the rape often shocks and disturbs them as much as the physical act itself.It is far too difficult to watch. Which means we must.This is not a movie that can be ignored. []A fascinating portrait of a modern artist and activist trying to make a difference within China\\'s repressive political system.The film\\'s recurring theme is of an artist on a perpetual hunt for transparency, in his country and abroad.This essential, finely honed biographical portrait is jollied along by all the ironies and complexities of modern China.Well worth seeing.Though we might wish for more insight or explanation, Klayman\\'s film remains an incredible document of a courageous individual who the Chinese officials would prefer to make disappear.A movie that somehow mixes apprehension for Ai with a feeling of warmth and, certainly, fun.Affable and unpretentious, Ai comes across as a cagey operator whose candor is very appealing.He is heroic.It\\'s likely to change the way you think about art and politics and the state of China today.The boundaries between performance and protest are virtuosically, vitally fuddled in this stirring documentary chronicling three years in the life of Ai Weiwei, the outspoken Chinese artist and dissident.Using archival footage dating back to Ai\\'s adventures in the New York art world in his 20s, Klayman traces his evolution as a creator and as an activist.The artist repudiated the repudiation. Art had, as art always should have, the last word.Fascinating account of Weiwei\\'s practice and politics that gives centre stage to his charismatic personality.In terms of getting his message out to a wider audience, this film simply and effectively serves as part of the cause.Klayman exploits the opportunity to follow a man at the eye of a cultural and political storm, although more detail on his creative process and private life would have welcome.Though he has paid the price, Ai is a pathfinder in this new phenomenon in tactical insurrection. Never Sorry is a new-style profile in 21st-century courage.Ai admits that he\\'s become \"a brand for liberal thinking and individualism,\" though that\\'s nothing to be ashamed of -- at this point, his Warholian talent for self-promotion may be the only thing keeping him alive.The story is enthralling, but it\\'s not over, and there\\'s no telling where it\\'s going. Which makes what we see on screen all the more involving.A sobering, cautionary tale. David France\\'s rousing and inspirational documentary should be required viewing for political activists everywhere.There are personal glimpses into the home lives of activists that left many in my theater wiping their tears on their coat sleeve.A compellingly watchable portrait of a battle fought under that most memorable rallying cry: \"Silence = Death\". Bravo.This inspirational, unexpectedly hilarious film is a patchwork of archival footage that takes us up to the present day.This documentary by David France persuasively argues that one of the greatest grassroots activist campaigns of modern times was the Act Up movement ...David France\\'s documentary about the 1980s/90s American gay community and its leading role in discovering \"combination therapy\" - the anti-HIV magic bullet - will be inspiring among audiences from the G20.This raw and passionate AIDS treatment doc suffers from a simple lack of focus.It\\'s no whitewash: important activists from the era admit how much time was lost through internecine squabbling, as well as the struggles they faced against the pitiless anti-gay rhetoric of their political opponents.It can\\'t be long before we see the Hollywood version.A moving treatment of a deeply personal subject (France\\'s own partner died of an AIDS-related illness in 1992), and an enthralling depiction of a seriously fired-up popular movement.David France has made an absorbing film to document that moment of immense implosion, called How to Survive a Plague.As this stirring, scrupulous doc reveals, the members of ACT UP fused the fervor of revolutionaries, the tenacity of trial lawyers, and the rage of the dispossessed to change the very shape of the epidemic.Plague offers an instructive lesson for Occupy-era rabble-rousers: Only when coupled with a knowledge base will your sound and fury signify anything.From a terrible epidemic comes a beautiful documentary.A raw history, often cluttered and sometimes repetitive but, when strategies fail along with immune systems, deeply affecting.Presents a valuable template for how grassroots activism can temper societal prejudice and challenge governmental indifference in the face of a mysterious and remorseless killer.A serious, moving and sometimes astonishingly well-organized documentary about the history of AIDS activism.[A] powerful, messy and tremendously moving documentary ...\"How to Survive a Plague\" captures a saddening, maddening era that seems like far too many lifetimes ago.It can feel inchoate, dropping the viewer in the middle of events without much context, and it exacts an emotional toll. But its raw quality also makes it compelling viewing. The result is a great modernist (i.e. reflexive) movie and a portrait of an artist, creatively and without any self-pity, looking for a way to preserve his freedom simply to represent the world as he sees it.Gave the Cannes festival - and moviemaking itself - an incontestable reason for being.Melancholy as it is, This Is Not A Film is no pity party. It evokes ennui and anxiety without ever being boring itself.\"This Is Not A Film\" portrays the fear of being forgotten when you can\\'t speak for yourself, when you\\'ve been removed from the public eye.If this is not a film, by all means let us have many more such not-a-films.This film is unique in a dreadful way: what happens on screen would not be particularly interesting without the facts surrounding its making.No matter the constrictions on its existence, This is Not a Film is, in fact, a great one.Not a conventional film, certainly, but a powerful and important statement.There is courage and cheekiness here. What there is not is a story, or much insight or even anger; anyone expecting an indictment of Iran will be sorely disappointed.Truly and defiantly extraordinary in its own quiet way.This may not be a film, but it\\'s a moving statement of defiance and despair.It\\'s a cry from the heart of an artist compelled to create, tell stories and respond to hostile, confounding realities.In short, \"This Is Not a Film\" is the world within an apartment, and it is quietly devastating.The more \"This Is Not a Film\" underscores the cruel containment of a great artist, the more we actually become aware - very indirectly, in a very Panahi fashion - of a city in chaos outside, with sounds of gunfire and distant street blazes.It\\'s a statement about courage, a poke in the eye of political oppression.I would like to show \"This Is Not a Film\" to those in the United States who are in favor of a close union of church and state.An act of political defiance, a moving personal document and a meditation on what film is and can be.What it all adds up to is a ruefully witty essay on what does or does not constitute cinema: Jean-Luc Godard grapples endlessly (some would say incomprehensibly) with these debates, but Panahi\\'s invigorating directness cuts to the chase.Nobody is likely to confuse This Is Not a Film with mainstream entertainment. But it is more fun than the vast majority of multiplex screensavers.A film which only reveals its true colours after intense contemplation. The best, most touching, most humbling documentary I\\'ve ever seen about a musician I\\'ve never heard of.[][][]At 85 minutes, it\\'s a tight, sharp achievement, yet one of the things I love about it is simple: It moves to a relaxed rhythm, in sync with its slightly otherworldly subject....it isn\\'t merely the content that makes Searching for Sugar Man so affecting: it\\'s the way that Swedish filmmaker Malik Bendjelloul sets up the story and peels away the mystery of Rodriguez, one layer at time.The search for a long-lost pop icon has an unexpected payoff.[A] moving, lyrical account ...It starts as a bittersweet parable about the cruelty of commerce, but the wonder of \"Searching for Sugar Man\" will not soon slip away.Director Malik Bendjelloul\\'s engaging, cleverly structured documentary about the legendary folk singer Rodriguez is shaped like a mystery.You watch \"Searching for Sugar Man\" at first fascinated by the mystery - what happened to Rodriguez? Where did he go? Then you become infuriated by its revelations of financial injustice.If you like music, a good mystery or, better yet, a combination of both, you won\\'t be disappointed.It isn\\'t that Searching for Sugar Man\\'s plot developments are gotcha!-like, but this documentary does boast some bowl-you-over reveals best experienced blind.Submitted for your approval: one Sixto Rodriguez, a Mexican-American singer/songwriter whom Rod Serling would surely embrace, in or out of the Twilight Zone.Beautiful and revelatory, Searching for Sugar Man also incorporates huge chunks of Rodriguez\\'s music.A rock documentary that goes way behind the music to tell a story that seems pure urban legend.Here\\'s the rare music documentary in which the narrative is more interesting than the songs.Bendjelloul mixes modern footage of Detroit with archival and animated images, and the shots of Rodriguez marching through his home turf help viewers understand what makes him tick.I hope you\\'re able to see this film. You deserve to. And yes, it exists because we need for it to.This is a real-life fairy tale with a remarkably happy ending. All eyes are on the ball, while the future screams from the sidelines.Undefeated works the whole macho-sentimental template so vigorously and well it\\'s practically a reflexive response to cry foul, but you\\'d have to find heroic reserves of cynicism not to care at all about the precarious fortunes of these unformed bruisers.A watchable movie, no question. But perhaps best filed under guilty pleasures.Can take its place proudly alongside the best in the genre.\\'Undefeated\\' is no \\'Hoop Dreams\\', but it\\'s sturdily built and worthwhile.It may be a film that feels rather than analyses, but Undefeated is a compelling, uplifting experience that can\\'t fail to move even the most US football-phobic.Instead, they show the universality of what it is he\\'s trying to teach, how color doesn\\'t necessarily bar one from being able to connect with these boys on a fundamental level.Even though the film relies on many of the clichs of the form, Undefeated is a masterfully crafted work that honestly scores a touchdown.\"Undefeated\" doesn\\'t have a deep penetration of poverty and race in its playbook, but it does have enough heart to make substantial forward progress.It\\'s a surprisingly moving, emotional film, even for those who (like me) know little of football; by its end, you just might be blinking away a few tears.[A] winning documentary.It is a powerful reminder of the difference one person can make -- and of the consequences when no one is willing to make that difference.[A] stirring, emotional portrait of a high school football team in the impoverished neighborhood of North Memphis, Tenn.It\\'s a bit too long and a bit too vague at times, but this is a film about dedication, progress and the bond of human effort. It just also happens to include football.\"Undefeated\\'\\' needs less of what we know we\\'ve seen (the football stuff) and more of the players\\' and coaches\\' lives, which even if we feel we\\'ve seen, we haven\\'t.What makes this a terrific film is how much we care about the players.Courtney really does believe all that stuff about adversity and character, and the film is moving for its modest tale of boys learning to act like men.This is one of the best sports documentaries of the last few years and while I don\\'t think it should have won in a VERY good year for non-fiction film, I\\'m really not upset at all that it did.The hardened inner-city kids here are far more authentic than anything Hollywood can offer, and as a result the film has a raw emotional weight that commercial features rarely achieve.This film is distinctly minor league. But it does provide the thumbs-up emotional lift of a bumper-sticker message on game day. A cracking story, buzzily edited, this warts-and-warts portrait delivers an illuminating insight into recent rock history. Don\\'t miss it.Bleakly entertaining, Beware of Mr Baker neither eulogises nor patronises its subject; one day (though possibly not soon), Baker may take it upon himself to say thanks.It\\'s a broadly forgiving portrait of an impossible, irascible talent, who seems to have treated life much like his instrument.We are always being told that books and movies have to have \"sympathetic\" lead characters - well, here\\'s a documentary that does very well without one.An interesting character study interspersed with classic rock, jazz and Afrobeat clips. Nothing more, but certainly nothing less.It\\'s all insanely enjoyable.It\\'s refreshing to watch a music doc, especially one with such intimate access to its subject, in which barely anyone is unreservedly polite about the person in question.A juicy slice of rock history.Ginger Baker has been revealed as a major talent, an innovator and an unlikely survivor. And a not very nice guy.Ginger Baker is, and was, a train wreck. Yet this film, like Baker\\'s onstage playing, is always riveting, and something you can\\'t look away from.\"Beware of Mr. Baker\" is comprehensive, if somewhat overly glowing.The takeaway: great musician, deficient family man, taxing friend and bandmate, excellent documentary subject.This is warts and all, with the emphasis on the warts.Although it hits many of the same notes as other recent musical docs, Beware of Mr. Baker nevertheless does a satisfactory job of capturing a restless personality.Bulger tries, unconvincingly, to paint Baker as a difficult but admirable rebel. The lingering question in the documentary is whether his musical accomplishments were worth the trail of damage.It gives Baker his musical props while at the same time demonstrating the film\\'s title is no exaggeration.Any movie that starts with the subject assaulting the director (Baker smacks plucky first-timer Jay Bulger squarely in the face with his cane) is already ahead of the game.If Clapton was God, guess who was the devil?Miserable individuals do tend to make for interesting subject matter, and this would be far more of a dry biography without its willfully eccentric lead.The life story of a man who\\'s led one hell of a fascinating life. It\\'s impossible to leave the cinema without hoping that the Papal resignation and the awful events explored here are not unrelated.A kind of unintentional leaving gift for the outgoing Pope Benedict, though it is not one he is likely to relish.The film shocks you to the marrow, and every frame burns with a righteous fire, itself religious in its intensity.The case has been widely reported but this is still an important film, laying out who knew what, and when. It\\'s chilling: the conspiracy of silence goes all the way to the Vatican.This is a tremendous documentary: at once cool and scalding, outraged and meticulous; a must-see for everyone, both inside and outside the \"House of God\".It may look like a documentary but Gibney\\'s film is a horror film in every sense. Essential, uncomfortable viewing.Well done and compelling, and at its strongest when focusing on the bravery of these four deaf men who broke the silence.It feels a bit like a monster movie. It is, too.In the end, decades of such crimes going undetected and undeterred under the aegis of one employer - any employer - speaks for itself. And the extraordinary perseverance and courage of the men from St. John\\'s speaks louder still.Partly an inspiring saga of growing \"deaf power\" and human resilience, and partly a murky and fragmentary drama about an immense, closed-minded bureaucracy with paranoid and conspiratorial tendencies that finds itself unable to adjust to the modern world.There is something to be said for a clear and unblinking recitation of facts, and thankfully Mr. Gibney does a lot of that.Gibney\\'s most powerful film since the Oscar-winning 2007 Taxi to the Dark Side.Fearless nonfiction filmmaker Alex Gibney details a history of horrific abuse by Catholic clergy in this tough-to-watch documentary.Primed to deliver a heady dose of outrage via a broad overview of systemic cover-ups tracing to the Vatican, as well as a specific and heartbreaking case in Wisconsin.To someone who was raised and educated in the Catholic school system, as I was, a film like this inspires shock and outrage.The film is one-sided, of course-church officials ignored interview requests, but their version has been around for a couple of millennia anyway.Mea Maxima Culpa only gets messier the more it tries to iris out to a larger indictment. The central tragedy ends up diluted to a fault.I don\\'t speak Latin, but I\\'m pretty sure that \"Mea Maxima Culpa\" translates into, \"Good grief, don\\'t watch this movie without access to some Excedrin.\"No one of true faith will get over Maxima Mea Culpa.Alex Gibney\\'s latest lacks a certain cinematic depth, but that doesn\\'t take away from its admirable reporting. A fascinating look at an extraordinary personality.The Island President is an important portrait of a determined man standing fast in a place where the ground is literally shifting beneath his feet.If you are in a fight, you want this man on your side. He is charismatic, brave and most of all entirely believes in what he is what he is doing. I\\'m not sure he know the meaning of the word compromise.Climate-change documentaries are almost always disturbing, but \"The Island President\" communicates a special urgency.Nasheed is indeed inspirational, a cool-headed but passionate and courageous guy. You end up wishing a lot more leaders were like this guy.Shenk expertly weaves Nasheed\\'s extraordinary personal story together with the Maldives\\' breathtaking natural beauty and a Capra-esque tale of dogged idealism and political courage to create wonderfully vivid cinematic portraiture.What makes Nasheed\\'s whirligig tactics so urgent is that, unlike most other countries participating in the summit, his own nation is actually in danger of being annihilated by climate change.\"The Island President\"is heartening and unsettling by turns.The Island President should be commended for offering a stark reminder that, while the world\\'s great nations turned their attentions to economics, the waters continued to rise.\"The Island President\" is a mostly compelling documentary about that rarest of breeds, an appealing politician.\"The Island President\" personalizes the threat of global warming, and nationalizes it too, by focusing on Mohamed Nasheed, the former president of the Maldives.Ex-Maldives president Mohamed Nasheed comes across in this documentary as a kind of climate-change Prospero.Sure it\\'s hagiographic, but this is environmentalist filmmaking at its best.What\\'s fascinating and frustrating about The Island President is how it reveals international politics to be even more polarized and mired in bureaucracy than local politics.Viewers get an eye-opening look at behind-the-scenes wrangling.A portrait of defiant optimism as a last-chance means of survival, Jon Shenk\\'s The Island President offers not only a Mandela-like tale of political heroism but a much-needed perspective on climate change.The hope that infuses this movie makes it all the more upsetting to walk out of the theater and contemplate a looming disaster that the world\\'s leaders seem unable to prevent.It\\'s fascinating to be so close to a then-sitting head of state as he negotiates for his homeland\\'s survival, and the news that Nasheed was recently deposed in a coup by Gayoom loyalists makes the hard-won victories he did secure all the more poignant.Moves swiftly from political scene-setting to follow Nasheed\\'s every move as he prepares to make an impassioned environmental plea at the 2009 Copenhagen Climate Summit.Shenk\\'s film is close enough to his subject to catch the leader who rails against carbon-dioxide emissions puffing on cigarettes in parking lots. [Jackie\\'s] story can show the ways in which the economic crisis can bring out not only the hierarchical differences that divide us, but the hopes and flaws that unite us.The Siegels are fascinating because they both are and aren\\'t us, and the film\\'s pleasures are correspondingly-a la reality tv-made up of equal parts jealousy, sympathy, and schadenfreude.[Siegel] is now suing Greenfield for \"misrepresentation\". Well, I know whose side I\\'m on.Greenfield\\'s film is bathed in Florida sunshine, adding to the sensation that we\\'re watching Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous with a Marxist punchline.Never has grotesque wealth looked so unenviable, or its removal been so entertaining, as in this garishly watchable riches-to-rags documentary ...[Siegel] ultimately emerges as someone who belongs more in The Little House on the Prairie: ever cheerful, and triumphantly unimpeachable.The temptation to be moralistic must have been overpowering, yet Greenfield finally manages to summon sympathy for people who at first seem vain, selfish and greedy.Prepare to be shocked, disgusted and compelled.It\\'s priceless.A bizarre and mesmerising journey to the heart of Cloud Cuckoo Land.Seriously, if this was the American Dream, couldn\\'t we have come up with something better?Although it\\'s a guilty pleasure, \"The Queen of Versailles\" is artful enough that both the prosecution and the defense could invoke it when the peasants cry \"Off with their heads!\"This rags-to-riches-to-almost-rags-again queen has an endearing knack for looking on the bright side. You find yourself, by the end, wishing her well.\"The Queen of Versailles\" is funny, sad, infuriating, instructive. It\\'s the American Dream inflated to ridiculous extremes, until it bursts.The Queen of Versailles presents a fascinating case study of how the collapsing economy impacted the superrich. It will also likely drive anybody who isn\\'t the superrich up the wall.More than a social morality tale, this is a character study, with the title well chosen.\"The Queen of Versailles\" ought to be required viewing for anyone who blames the rich for yanking the rug out from under America\\'s economy.By the end, the movie has pulled off a small miracle: You become absorbed in the lives of these people for who they are and not what they own.What I left with was not hatred. I disapprove of the values they represent, but I also find them fascinating and just slightly lovable.\"The Queen of Versailles\" turns out to be a portrait -- appalling, absorbing and improbably affecting -- of how, even within a system seemingly designed to ensure that the rich get richer, sometimes the rich get poorer. It\\'s not a new story, true, but \"West of Memphis\" makes it both extremely personal and universally painful.The film is so utterly transfixing you won\\'t believe almost two-and-a-half hours have passed when the final credits roll.We feel like we\\'re watching an overlong true-crime television episode and not a movie.Moving and gruesome, West of Memphis is an eloquent disquisition on the banality of evil.A real-life horror story, made no less shocking by the familiarity of its early scenes.While the \"Paradise Lost\" films captured events as they unfolded in the heat of battle, \"West of Memphis\" has the luxury of at least partial closure.And justice for all? Hardly.It tells the story of a terrible crime compounded by a grave injustice that\\'s been remedied, but only in part, so it\\'s impossible to have a single or simple response to the movie.What sets this film apart from previous efforts to document the story is that Jackson and Walsh financed a private investigative team with legal and forensic experts who re-examined old evidence, conducted new interviews and found new witnesses.The new film is largely a recap of the older ones, with more celebrity testimonials and fewer Metallica songs but little fresh insight into the miscarriage of justice it chronicles.Happy, sad, inspiring, infuriating, right and terribly wrong, all at the same time.Berg\\'s film is as much an indictment of the state of Arkansas\\' legal system as it is the prosecution.Berg\\'s film helps illuminate a case that should certainly be the shame of the state of Arkansas, and perhaps the criminal justice system of the entire United States.Dubious evidence; suspicious confessions; conveniently located \"poor white trash\" (Echols\\' words) to take the rap: The case stank from the beginning, Berg\\'s film argues.Less an investigative report than a portrait of the community that forms around an ongoing court case, this conveys a patient understanding of the intricacies of law and human behavior that may be termed Kieslowskian.\"West of Memphis\" is the fourth film about one of the most heinous cases of wrongful conviction in American judicial history. Do we need a fourth film? Yes, I think we do.It artfully sketches out the events for anyone who\\'s coming in cold, but basically, its strategy is to take what we already know and go deeper.A lot of it is treading on ground that\\'s been laid by other people, but there\\'s a lot of great new stuff, too.An extraordinary story told with utter conviction but not without a certain sympathy for the court of public opinion - which wrecked the chance of proper justice for the accused for so long.It took way too long, but the crowd finally bested the mob. Director Bart Layton pieces together a story you wouldn\\'t believe if it wasn\\'t true.More than anything it\\'s Layton\\'s storytelling acumen that impresses - the movie unfolds like a psychological thriller, and in the second half effects a chilling twist on its own inherent implausibility.In the annals of forged identity flicks, this is a towering Everest, dwarfing the deceivers in the likes of Catch Me If You Can and F for Fake.This is edge-of-your-seat stuff and the difficulty is in the telling of the tale. To give any of this film away is a crime. You simply have to see it for yourself.The most fascinating aspect of the movie is why the missing boy\\'s family believed the imposter\\'s story.You may begin to wonder if you aren\\'t being conned by the movie yourself.Incredibly well-made and with a story you won\\'t forget, \"The Imposter\" is one of the better docs of the season.The Imposter emerges as a brilliantly slippery film that demands brain-stretching consideration. Astonishing, indeed.British director Bart Layton has only slightly fictionalised this extraordinary story for his documentary, which is told more as a thriller than a statement of hard fact.\"The Imposter\" is one of the best films of the year.When this film was over, I felt as if I had been holding my breath for 99 minutes. It is pure, delicious suspense.The mysteries stick with you. In 20 years time, someone will leap up and shout, \"Eureka!\"Think of Clint Eastwood\\'s Changeling and multiply by the power of reality.You couldn\\'t make this stuff up - and no one would buy it as fiction. But as a documentary, it\\'s a different matter.The year\\'s most fascinating and frightening doc so far, The Imposter delves far beneath the hysterical tabloid headlines.It\\'s both preposterous and horrific, and therein lies its powerful, disquieting charm.Beverly Dollarhide, Nicholas\\'s mother, says of the period after her son\\'s disappearance, \"My main goal in life at that time was not to think.\" Apparently, the filmmakers have taken a cue from her.Layton\\'s dazzling film is an exciting, edge-of-your-seat experience superior to any Hollywood mystery you\\'re likely to see for a long time.\"The Imposter\" becomes more than just a missing-persons drama. It hints at something much darker: a real-life horror story, the full truth of which may never be known.This is one creepy mystery. Marley aficionados will be astonished by the depth and breadth of the documentary, which portrays the musician known as Tuff Gong as both a fallible man and an untouchable legend.Marley is highly watchable, finely crafted legacy preservation - and it\\'s either a white-washed sham or awesomely shaded.It wants to show us the man behind the famous dreads, beatific smile and durable songs of love, hope and longing. In this task it succeeds admirably.You\\'ll walk away from this ambitious documentary longing to hear Marley\\'s voice again (thank heaven for iTunes) and with a deep respect for a man.Sprinkled with riffs, concert footage and home videos, the family-authorized documentary does what the artist usually did: When in doubt, return to the beat.Macdonald supplies some interesting and novel details about the musician\\'s life and art, though the movie\\'s narrative arc and documentary methods are totally predictable.Marley finally gives the world an authoritative, nonhagiographic survey of Marley\\'s life.This is an appropriately exhaustive study of the man and his music, its only failing is the absence of a decent political analysis of Rastafari and the beliefs that informed Marley to the end of his life.Given the legal and logistical constraints on this long-delayed project, this lengthy movie is as comprehensive a history as Marley\\'s fans could have hoped, but the uninitiated may not catch a fire.Bob Marley wrote the same song about 8,000 times, and the documentary \"Marley\" makes sure to include each version.Even audiences for whom easing up to dutty riddims is not an habitual pursuit will get an intoxicating whiff of reggae\\'s soothing powers from Marley...This is a life story worth telling, and \"Marley\" does it much justice. Marley may or may not have been perfect, but he was certainly fascinating.It\\'s hard to imagine audiences who don\\'t know much about the man sticking around for more than a few minutes of this. And they\\'re the ones who need to know about him most of all.The movie has enormous force - because it\\'s about a genius, yes, but even more so because of the intelligence, passion and wit of the people who knew Marley.It\\'s exhaustive without being exhausting, an eye-opening and all-encompassing portrait that should go a long way to rescuing him from being a marijuana mascot.Kevin Macdonald\\'s solid, informative, respectful bio-doc is not quite the dazzling, innovative non-fiction we might have expected from the Oscar-winning director of Touching the Void.Chronologically organized and voiceover-free, the movie is a 145-minute patchwork of old concert footage and talking-head interviews -- lots and lots of them -- from people who knew, loved, and worked with the reggae giant.The enormous popularity of the transcendent reggae superstar shows no signs of abating, a situation\"Marley,\" a moving and authoritative new documentary, takes as its mission to illustrate and explain.Even those who know reggae star Bob Marley inside and out might be amazed by the scope, detail and beauty of \"Marley\"...Stylistically unremarkable, playing it safe with structure, the film is still quietly revelatory. True, there\\'s no blood this time around, no gruesome images of dolphins dying, but it could be argued that the supernaturally beautiful images that Balog (and, by extension, Orlowski) captures are even more despairing and alarming...[A] spectacular but depressing documentary.If seeing equals believing, then this film\\'s documentation ought to sway the world. But daredevil heroes and sexy screen goddesses probably help the medicine go down.[]Is this about the hazards of global warming or the awesomeness of James Balog? Not entirely sure...If any film can convert the climate-change sceptics, Chasing Ice would be it: here, seeing really is believing.National Geographic photographer James Balog illustrates climate change with time-lapsed records of glacial retreat.A project of heroic, Herzogian endeavour. Mad, you might say. But probably not as mad as what the rest of us are doing about climate change: namely almost nothing.Still an eco-sceptic? Clap your eyes on this lot. Awe-inspiring, terrifying, transcendently beautiful, and absolutely weighted with significance for the future of the planet.The most important documentary of the year.If you\\'re looking for eye-popping evidence that the world\\'s glaciers are melting, don\\'t miss the small-scale but spectacular documentary, Chasing Ice.The rapid disappearance of ice mountains, filmed over a period of years, is compressed through time-lapse technology into minutes and seconds. The speeded-up effect is harrowing and also, disturbingly, eerily beautiful.The movie might have given us a bit less of Balog and a bit more of the startling sequences he produced.Though the filmmaker\\'s point of view on the matter seems quite clear, Orlowski does smartly acknowledge counterarguments against climate change without dwelling on them.You couldn\\'t ask for a more dramatic moment than the climactic sequence.\"Chasing Ice\" aims to accomplish, with pictures, what all the hot air that has been generated on the subject of global warming hasn\\'t been able to do: make a difference.The photography is often beautiful (the blue glaciers sparkle in the sun like massive sapphires), but it\\'s disturbing - and sure to convince any climate-change doubters.As much as one may intellectually believe in climate change, to see it actually happening has the power to stun a viewer into wordlessness.Provides a memorable bookend to accompanying shots of storms, fires, and floods from the last few years, ones that resonate urgently with the recent Hurricane Sandy damage still in the news.The \"green\" teams looking into such energy sources as solar, wind and nuclear are often ridiculed. Watch \"Chasing Ice\" and see if you laugh. Brooklyn Castle does a superb job of celebrating the triumph while reinforcing the relentless vigilance it requires from everyone involved.Brooklyn Castle is inspiring stuff that grabs you by the throat and will leave you cheering - quietly of course. No shouting in a chess match.There\\'s a general spirit of triumph and perseverance to \"Brooklyn Castle\" that\\'s inevitably uplifting.[][]\"Brooklyn Castle\" easily checkmates your inner cynic.Katie Dellamaggiore\\'s lively and affecting documentary introduces us to a cast of characters that\\'s very winning (in both senses of the word).It\\'s not To Sir, With Love: It\\'s fierce ambition, the channeling of emotion, and hours of drilling.We meet five of the team\\'s members and several of their teachers; by its end, you\\'ll be rooting for them all.Enlightening, inspiring and expertly crafted.An irresistibly uplifting doc.The message is that chess can motivate working-class kids to become better students, and though that\\'s nice to know, the movie doesn\\'t illustrate this theme in much depth.I don\\'t know diddly about chess, and I still loved it.Every player knows the finality when the other player sadly turns over his king, signaling surrender. We know it even better when we do it ourselves.It\\'s a wonderful documentary look at an astonishingly successful public-school chess program that manages to be more moving and heartening than you expect. Which is saying a lot.Beyond telling the touching stories of these unlikely champions, Brooklyn Castle serves to raise a battle cry for funding for after-school programs.There is much of what you expect -- gifted kids, dedicated teacher, tense anticipation, thrilling victories. The characters are endearing and their stories are stirring.Set against a backdrop of deep budget cuts and high-stakes testing, this story makes an eloquent plea for the crucial but endangered role of afterschool programs in public education.Socioeconomic concerns bring depth to doc about pre-teen chess whizzes.As inspirational academic stories go, it doesn\\'t get much better than this. This is how the conflict looks from the other side of the barrier.A fascinating reminder of why the humble video camera can be used as a weapon against political oppression.It is of course a one-sided film, but a powerful personal testimony: the kind of material that never makes the nightly news.Each broken camera records a human tragedy as it flickers with its last gaze.Burnat\\'s first-person footage of skirmishes with Israeli forces, filmed over five years on the titular damaged equipment, should have been allowed to tell its own story.A tough watch that\\'ll leave you despairing of peace anytime soon.A touching and revelatory piece of film-making about the plights of real people living in an uncertain world.As raw as the material of \"5 Broken Cameras\" can be, it is also lyrical and elegiac.[A] bit jagged, inevitably incomplete, and in no way news-breaking: it is simply moving.Takes the rough material of one man\\'s life and transforms it into a story that is universal and urgent, offering firsthand witness to events that are too often portrayed as distant and impossible to understand.[]Both a moving first-person essay and an artful exercise in political advocacy, 5 Broken Cameras is about the experience of West Bank protests from the inside.[It] makes no pretense at balance - it\\'s unambiguously pro-Palestinian - but it offers a unique and intimate record.Israeli filmmaker Guy Davidi helps shape all of the footage into a compelling and very personal documentary, helping to craft the eloquent commentary in Burnat\\'s voice that knits it all together.What we do see has an immediacy and intimacy that\\'s involving. It also can feel a bit wayward and cumulatively wearying.The issues are complex and not easily solved. But no matter which side you are on, you\\'ll be moved by this intimate work.It offers a look at how a tireless protest can sometimes only come at the expense of one\\'s own daily existence.\"5 Broken Cameras\" provides a grim reminder - just in case you needed one - of the bitter intractability of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Startlingly intimate and direct, this first-person doc by Emad Burnat and Guy Davidi requires multiple viewings for anyone eager to work out how it could have been shot with such precision and visual ingenuity under such plainly chaotic conditions.Troublesome, worthy. []\"She\\'s never not performing,\" says one friend. And the documentary, \"Marina Abramovic: The Artist Is Present,\" confirms it.Briskly edited and brightly shot.Beginning as an overview of her career, this fascinating doc closes in on the show and its many revealing encounters, asking us to consider face-to-face engagement as a way of dissolving the barriers between an artist and her public.In place of evenhandedness, the film gives us a full sense of a personality and intelligence so riveting that we begin to comprehend why all those hundreds of thousands lined up at the MoMA.Thanks largely to the engaging nature of its protagonist, Marina Abramovic: The Artist Is Present stands up as one of the most diverting documentaries to hit the big screen this year.Marina Abramovi?√ß emerges from this arresting documentary as the Maria Callas of performance art.Here, you start to feel, is commodified culture at work in its capital city.Abramovic is nothing less than magnetic.[]Abramovic is raw and likeable, if mostly inscrutable.A little pretentious maybe, but then you\\'ve got to wonder at a woman who could sit motionless in a wooden chair, eight hours a day for three months.The film\\'s centerpiece is the retrospective devoted to Abramovic at the Museum of Modern Art in the spring of 2010.The film goes a long way to establish the intellectual seriousness and dedication involved in her ambitious series of art stunts.The second half offers shot after shot of the people who sat opposite Abramovi - an unexpectedly enthralling record of reactions that range from stark agony to rather phony amusement.So magnetic is she that if Abramovic had chosen to be a baker, or a janitor, you could still make a film about her and it would be only slightly less bombastic, and no less stirring.A portrait of an artist whose life and work intertwine in ways even more compelling than might be imagined.When director Matthew Akers is able to make Abramovic\\'s titular 2010 MoMA exhibition - featuring anonymous, silent, face-to-face sit-downs - undeniably moving, something is obviously working.The Artist Is Present does at least seem to capture moments where Abramovic seems genuine...We\\'re given an intimate seat to this wildly democratic - and creepily messianic - spectacle. Fantastic fun. It\\'s full of energy and zing, just like its subject, although, just like its subject, it also feels less than truthful somehow.We suspect that in her imperious voice, Vreeland would say she was mad about it, and she\\'d mean it as a measure of praise.She wanted you to look and look again, and this film is full of images which make you do just that.There\\'s something marvellously comic about her, an effect reinforced by her refined yet raucous baritone voice.Her life, and her work, transcended what we think of as \"fashion.\" Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel celebrates a unique and uniquely determined woman.Many people remember some of Diana Vreeland\\'s famous pronouncements (\"I adore pink! It is the navy blue of India!\") but few remember actually hearing her speak. The documentary Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel takes care of that.The filmmakers have done a fine job corralling so many fantastic tales from Vreeland\\'s life.For fashionphiles and pop culture vultures, there\\'s much to devour.Diana Vreeland is both history lesson and sentimental love letter to a fashion titan.Legendary fashion editor Diana Vreeland was the consummate dreamer, a romantic who never looked back and propelled society forward.\"Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel\" is an intriguing portrait of a true original; you only wish the movie had half the color and verve of its subject.A feast for fashion-history buffs and anyone who applauds unstoppable eccentricity.The late, legendary fashion editor comes alive in \"Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel,\" an awkwardly titled but engaging documentary.A highly entertaining and colorful portrait of a unique woman.The visual emphasis in The Eye Has to Travel is on the pages of the magazines Vreeland dominated, and as such it\\'s a sleek eyeful.Vivid, delicious trip through the heyday of fashion mags is a must for followers of clothes, print design, and high society.Vreeland comes across in the movie as something of a cross between Auntie Mame and Godzilla. She was a true original in a world where knock-offs abounded.The film, written and directed by Vreeland\\'s granddaughter-in-law, mainly rests on the strength of its subject.Makes a compelling case for the late Diana Vreeland as the 20th century\\'s pre-eminent tastemaker, not to mention one of its most extravagant personalities.The movie has a lot going for it. The movie\\'s indictment would be more persuasive had Jarecki recognized that his audience likely already knows most of what he recaps, and can handle the odd scrap of ambiguity.\"The House I Live In\" leaves you shaking your head in deadened wonder at the waste of it all.One of the best documentaries out this year, and a must-see for Senate and Congress in America.An angry and personal attack on America\\'s war on drugs contends it is a grotesquely wasteful public-works scheme.Jarecki is a stickler for sticking to his subject, or sub-subject, until it squeals like a leech victim.Jarecki offers 100 small conclusions rather than one big one for you to take away.This urgent and formidably smart movie - perhaps the year\\'s most important political documentary - has opened minds and changed laws already.Tells a complex story with troubling ease.The House I Live In is a work of journalism, not propaganda: Jarecki has done his research and leaves it to you to decide what to make of it.If [it] takes a while to focus, it eventually becomes the conversation starter the subject desperately needs.The House I Live In is depressing stuff, but it sparks the fires of anger, and from that anger, possible action.Jarecki takes a highly original approach to create a compelling, thought-provoking look at a highly relevant and controversial topic.An absorbing, disturbing sit.It\\'s a film as profoundly sad as it is enraging and potentially galvanizing, and it\\'s one of the most important pieces of nonfiction to hit the screen in years.Jarecki\\'s case is so compelling that, when he concludes by comparing the drug war to the Holocaust, the obvious charge of hyperbole doesn\\'t quite stick.Jarecki\\'s film makes a shattering case against the War on Drugs ...[Jarecki\\'s] analysis is far too simplistic.The evidence Jarecki amasses against the drug wars in \"The House I Live In\" is more than strong enough to withstand any excess rhetorical zeal.A model of the ambitious, vitalizing activist work that exists to stir the sleeping to wake.A very potent movie. Sing Your Song is broad and complete, but like most biographical documentaries of legendary performers that we\\'ve seen of late, it is also hagiographic.By far the best parts are the first two-thirds, with the star taking center stage in history as it unfolds.Abundant archival footage is in part a saving grace.Sing Your Song is beautifully directed by Susanne Rostock to be as much about the man as it is about his times.The portrait of Belafonte that emerges from the film is also the portrait of the times of his life, the times of the nation\\'s life in the past 60 years.With excerpts of early clips of his first roles, to current interviews with him, the movie details a life of tremendous creativity and courage.[]The snag is his own narration, which gilds the lily - and the closer we get to the present, the more everyone drifts into \"yes, we can\" soundbites.An admirable man, and an admirable film about him.The man\\'s good works are plain to see, but his personality remains an enigma.A rewarding watch and an inspirational, informative history lesson which begins more strongly than it ends.There\\'s so much more to Belafonte than the Banana Boat Song and Rostock does a fine job revealing it in a fitting celebration of a mighty talent.What a man.\"Harry Belafonte: Sing Your Song\" smoothly rewinds an inspirational life.The film\\'s hagiographic tone is regrettable, but, it must be said, Belafonte\\'s heroism is the real deal.If nothing else, Sing Your Song works as a testament to Belafonte\\'s drive and dedication to causes well outside the usual goals of simply making money.A film that while quite personal in its storytelling comes without the rigor or the power of an independent filmmaking voice.\"Sing Your Song\" is a vital document of American history, which I recommend to everyone, and also an attempt to massage the patriotic legacy of a complex and polarizing figure.It\\'s only fitting that Harry Belafonte\\'s big, bountiful life has inspired an expansive, understandably hagiographic documentary, \"Sing Your Song.\"The documentary\\'s pace and energy gives an urgency to the political activism central to the restless Harry Belafonte\\'s remarkable life. Anyone with an interest in dance should enjoy this documentary ...Settles for heartwarming \"follow your dreams\" platitudes rather than following the cold realities of being a dancer.A blandly feelgood documentary about aspiring young ballet dancers.A griping documentary following several ballet hopefuls as they prepare for an international competition.Undeniably effective as drama, as we ponder the varying degrees of ambition and talent driving these young people to push their bodies beyond the limit in the hope of grasping a future in the spotlight.A touching look at ballet\\'s battle-hardened youngsters.It does a great job developing its characters through its visuals - these are superphysical kids - and honing in on family dynamics.If you have a yearning to feel awkward, inadequate and lazy, watching the whirling teenage (and preteen) talents in director Bess Kargman\\'s First Position will do the trick.It\\'s a wealth of material at odds with a scant running time and shallow focus.When it\\'s over, you won\\'t remember so much about who won and who lost. Instead, what remains is the expression on a young dancer\\'s face, reflected in a mirror: showing the joy of being in love with what you do.For someone (like me) who has never been to a ballet, the talent of these teens and tweens is a revelation.A number of the performances are plain stunning - Aran and Joan, in particular, seem born to move - and in many ways watching the movie is like watching a sporting event; there are winners and losers and favorites to cheer on.It\\'s an intense journey, and Kargman captures it all, down to the dancers\\' bloodied and bruised feet.Yes, it is possible to create a gripping documentary about the ballet world without resorting to \"Black Swan\" melodramatics.Child ballet dancer and former journalist Bess Kargman brings a dancer\\'s passion and insight to her directorial debut, illuminating the addictive magic and fierce demands of a ballet dancer\\'s life.Because its subjects are so driven and so talented, \"First Position,\" which is about ballet, is more gripping than the norm.The film shows the grueling work it takes for young dancers like Zamora to look effortless on stage, and First Position shows teachers who range from supportive to borderline abusive.This is yet another competition doc in the unending legacy of Spellbound, but Kargman is light on her feet, and she has chosen to follow a fascinating group of kids preparing for the 2010 Youth America Grand Prix.Beneath the jets and bleeding feet, First Position is about toughness of mind as much as visions of beauty. In one case it\\'s about a transformation so profound as to be unfathomable.Documentaries don\\'t have to be technically great to be irresistible, and Bess Kargman\\'s First Position, which follows six young ballet dancers as they prepare for an elite competition, is a case in point. The documentary would have been that much better with a more explicit focus on why the average filmgoer should care.This is route-one stuff.No serious film enthusiast will, however, want to miss Side by Side.Maybe this geekily precise, Keanu Reeves-fronted documentary fretting over the death of celluloid needs to give digital its due.Keanu Reeves is a game frontman of this fact-filled, slightly chaotic doc about the rise of digital technology in film.It\\'s sweet and sparkling, as glassfuls of thought are provided by James Cameron, Martin Scorsese, George Lucas, David Lynch, Steven Soderbergh and other champagne cinematic cerebra.It\\'s this simple: If you like movies, you need to see \"Side by Side.\"Actors such as Robert Downey Jr. complain that because digital cameras can be reloaded in seconds, there is no time for performers to hang out in their trailers between takes (in protest, he urinated in jars, which he hid all over the sets of Zodiac).Side by Side doesn\\'t give too much weight to either half of the debate, correctly noting that the move to digital has both pros and cons while offering a rather detailed history of how we got here.There is great flux in this world, as Side by Side so entertainingly demonstrates, and where it\\'s all headed is both discomforting and exhilarating. Stay tuned.Side By Side works as well as it does by celebrating the filmmaking practice as a distinctive art form no matter what process it uses to make images into motion.An unapologetically serious, geek-friendly documentary, it talks pixels, grain, depth of field and other technical concerns with a variety of directors, cinematographers, special-effects wizards and more.A surprisingly accessible documentary about an often very technical subject - the revolution surrounding Hollywood\\'s rapid conversion from 35mm film to digital technologies.\"Side by Side\" is a kind of eulogy for celluloid, beginning with some of the most famous images committed to film: \"A Trip to the Moon,\" \"Citizen Kane,\" \"The Wizard of Oz.\"For a film geek this movie is absolute heaven, a dream symposium in which directors, cinematographers, editors and a few actors gather to opine on the details of their craft.Alas, if you\\'re someone who enjoys movies as, say, a two-hour escape, you may find this documentary on the death of film at digital\\'s hands a bit too inside baseball.Film enthusiasts especially will appreciate this wonky but fascinating documentary about the process of making movies.The film is about how the digital revolution has changed the ways moviemakers capture, edit, and manipulate images, and it gets practically every famous, relevant person on the record.A meditation on the ways that art and technology flow into each other.Even disinterested viewers will have complicated feelings about the aesthetic, practical, and philosophical questions director Chris Kenneally poses about his subject.Ever wonder what would happen if Keanu Reeves met David Lynch? A searing, purposeful documentary -- a 21st century cautionary tale.The film, in some ways a primer on the perennial intractability of racial prejudice, clearly intends to be some sort of vindication of its five central figures. It succeeds in the first respect but falls wide of the mark in the second.It\\'s a vivid and gripping documentary (although, at two hours, somewhat longer than it needs to be), a grave indictment of a city and a system at the breaking point.The Central Park Five,\" the second best documentary of 2013, examines the case, placing in perfect context of what was happening in 1989 in NYC and how it led to evil both in Central Park and in the offices of the people trying to keep us safe.Expect your blood pressure to rise during The Central Park Five.The doc is rife with smart or wrenching or shameful moments. The fresh interviews with the accused, now men, are invaluable.Burns and company conduct a thorough, riveting investigation that does a far better job of assessing the tragedy than the justice system did two decades before. Of course, hindsight is an advantage we all take for granted.As grim a portrait of the criminal justice system as can be imagined.How could this second crime have occurred? The film asks that question but only partly answers it, and in the process it raises an even more troubling one.\"The Central Park Five\" is a sobering indictment of racism and vigilante justice, yet it is constrained by a PBS-style deference to the very system it critiques.\"The Central Park Five\" is worth seeing, both for the ways it\\'s timeless and for the ways it encapsulates an era.What\\'s amazing about listening to them speak now, often through tears, is the absence of bitterness.You\\'ll notice something odd as you watch and your anger rises at the injustice of it all: The anger of the wrongly convicted does not.The film offers a snapshot of the white hysteria then gripping the city, which was stoked by the tabloids and resulted in police and prosecutors railroading five black youths into prison.An unusually good documentary about an outlandish miscarriage of justice.Involves a detailed reconstruction of how the story broke, was developed and was dramatized by lurid tabloid headlines.Central Park is at first discomforting, then enraging, then illuminating.What she and her father and husband have drawn from this material is a combustible amalgam: a movie about justice violated, rectified, and denied.A careful, thoughtful documentary that meticulously re-creates what happened on that night and details how and why everything went so terribly off-course.Watching \"The Central Park Five\" is a deeply affecting experience. It is, as per usual for Hartley, a giddy, lightning-paced celebration of cheerfully terrible movies.[Director Mark Hartley] has assembled a lively collection of clips and interviews that gives the Cannon story definition and shape, without stinting on the gratuitous anecdotes.Offers a cornucopia of spectacularly trashy clips that will leave you laughing, screaming and squirming - sometimes all at once.What it does offer are some wildly colourful, jaw-dropping anecdotes from their friends and collaborators about their working methods.Fortunately, in the hands of the documentary film-maker Mark Hartley, the result is a romp through the insalubrious depths of the straight-to-video bin of your local 1980s video rental establishment.Well, there\\'s a bizarre fascination to it all.Kudos has to be given to Hartley for lifting the lid on a host of bad practices and making an honest documentary that could so easily have been turned into a juvenile exercise in macho backslapping.Electric Boogaloo is basically a celebration of chutzpah.Entertaining (more so than most Cannon films), but also insightful about bizarre strands of 1980s film history.This promising doc fails to capture the Cannon spiritCannily approximates a channel-surfing quality with its propulsive alternation of clips and interviews.their dogged pursuit of the bottom line & the lowest common denominator, combined with genuine cinephilia, artistic ambitions & a staggering lack of good taste, would engender delirious genre mashups alongside the odd, unexpected masterpiece.Hartley\\'s film is consistently entertaining, if somewhat one-note.\"Electric Boogaloo\" doesn\\'t tell its story from A to Z, but rather in a digressive, choral fashion that privileges outrageous personal anecdotes over dry historical chronologies. It doesn\\'t pull punches or try to paint a more palatable picture, director Lee Hirsch delivering his saga of kid-on-kid brutality with a didactic verisimilitude that\\'s decidedly chilling.Bully\" is smart and compassionate about the pain of its wounded subjects and the frustration felt by their parents, seemingly abandoned by the system. What the powerful film lacks is insight into bullying.Hirsch seldom gets face time with any bullies or their parents, and he tends to ignore the complicated social and psychological patterns that feed the problem.Your heart hurts for these kids, and the blood boils, too, at irrefutable evidence that these children are not safe in their schools.For a film that understandably only scratches the surface of its topic, Bully carries a devastating emotional punch.It would have been nice if the film had reflected its title a bit more and looked at the bullies themselves - what drives one kid to torture another? Is it a reaction to home life, is it fear, is it innate awfulness?\"Bully\" is a good start to a necessary conversation, but its loving voice is likely to be drowned out by haters who hide their own wounded hearts behind Internet pseudonyms and broadcast microphones.I hope all middle schoolers and high schoolers will see this movie -- and parents, teachers, and school administrators, too.\"Bully\" presents so many devastating moments that it\\'s hard to pick the most powerful one.\"Bully\" doesn\\'t need research or great filmmaking or narrative focus, per se. It needs only the shaming power of its relentlessness and a young audience open to sharing in that shame.A deeply moving but highly selective look at the effects of bullying on children and teenagers.The best Hirsch\\'s film can do, in the end, is remind us that bullying means more than we admit, and its effects aren\\'t always immediately clear, even to loved ones.Heartbreaking as these stories are, \"Bully\" is too narrow in scope to be anything approaching definitive. Most notably absent from the film are the bullies themselves.Bully doesn\\'t offer solutions, it raises awareness, and does so remarkably well.We feel sympathy for the victims, and their parents or friends, but the film helplessly seems to treat bullying as a problem without a solution.It presents a dramatic case for creating supportive communities that will stand up to those being bullied in the world. Now the onus is on all of us to play our part in making it happen.Tackles this headline-heavy topic by mixing moments of raw emotional power with intervals of somewhat suspect manipulation.Hirsch\\'s documentary truly shocks by the two sets of outrageous bureaucrats it exposes: one cowers on-screen, and the other hides in the offices of the MPAA, America\\'s movie censor.There\\'s no doubt \\'Bully\\' should be required viewing in every classroom in AmericaWhat Bully does is offer viewers the potential to connect a growing network of like-minded people, and does so with elegant storytelling. Demme hasn\\'t stopped seeking out new angles on this old warhorse, and even the odd speck of spittle on the lens cannot obscure the fact Young increasingly looks and sounds like one of the all-time greats.Jonathan Demme makes his third concert film with Young, including shots practically right up his nostrils.These two world-renowned and individualistic artists from the worlds of music and film clearly bask in each other\\'s company. We, the audience, would be fools to respond otherwise.On its own terms, \"Neil Young Journeys\" is an enjoyable concert film of a solo show in Toronto, interspersed with memories of his Canadian boyhood.\"Journeys\" is simply a trip most need not take.I\\'d say the movie does a fine job of completing the trilogy, but I wouldn\\'t be surprised if Demme and Young have more in them yet.The concert camera work is sometimes a little tight for comfort (not really interested in Young\\'s bridge work), though it adds to the intensity.Like Young, Demme often takes an iconoclastic route. This is in part a concert film, yes, but not a traditional one.Forget Crosby, Stills and Nash and maybe even Crazy Horse. Jonathan Demme might be Neil Young\\'s ultimate collaborator.As a songwriter, Young can still deliver: one of the best tunes here is a lovely, piano-propelled number, \"Leia,\" that he hasn\\'t even released yet.The wartsy antipode of Katy Perry: Part of Me, with an intimacy and intensity bordering on the overwhelming.For true believers, \"Neil Young Journeys\" is a visit with a still-vital friend. For the merely curious, it\\'s proof that there\\'s more to the man - more strangeness, deeper communions with the muse - than classic rock radio will ever let on.The point of this valuable and continuing exercise is intimacy, not nostalgia per se. Demme keeps it simple, apart from the occasionally trippy lens move.With its one-of-a-kind poetic lamentation, Young\\'s voice sounds more peculiarly lovely than ever. A small picture, but good and true.It\\'s an intimate performance portrait, divided among new material from his 2010 album \"Le Noise\" and many of his classics.More casual fans will twist in their chairs uncomfortably, wishing that a roadie would walk up and wipe it off. Neil Young die-hards will cherish the spittle.A feast for Neil Young lovers and initiates alike.As great and intimate as Live at Massey Hall 1971 may be, it\\'s not as transportive as this filming of a Neil Young performance at the venue 30 years later.What\\'s the point of this particular project? Why - apart from any marketing concerns - did either artist feel it was essential to capture this concert on film?The nicest thing I can think of to say about the doc \"Neil Young Journeys\" is that at least it isn\\'t in 3-D. A fascinating portrait of a 21st-century post-industrial hellscape.Detropia\\'s filmmakers stay out of the picture, hanging back to allow the viewer to absorb the meaning of Detroit\\'s fate. It is even more complex than we thought.A startling, haunting documentary about a once-great city, \"Detropia\" is all but a eulogy for Detroit.Rachel Grady and Heidi Ewing, Oscar-nominated for their earlier Jesus Camp, aim a compassionate and artful lens in their new documentary Detropia, finding signs of life in the ruined city.City services are shutting down, schools are closing, houses are being demo\\'d by the thousands - like lights being turned out one by one, \"Detropia\" powerfully captures a city fighting not to go dark.Artfully - perhaps too artfully - illustrates the transformation of the Motor City from a middle-class utopia to an urban nightmare of blight, crime and fleeing residents.Just as the film finds an aesthetic in its dilapidated setting, the city\\'s residents find hope in a desperate place, a place that once represented hope itself.The movie is heavy on statistics (all of them grim), yet what lingers is an operatic sense of tragedy.\"Detropia\" feels somewhere between loose (which is good) and aimless (which isn\\'t).Via beautiful cinematography, the film wanders the city, contrasting a new automaker\\'s towers with abandoned hotels, derelict theaters, ruined houses and people walking through the snow down the middle of streets because there\\'s no traffic.Grady and Ewing are exceptionally skilled and sensitive visual storytellers, adroit at recognizing decisive moments and smart enough to let viewers make of them what they will.\"Detropia\" offers up a mirror to the country: This is what the future may look like. Now, what do you want to do about it?This documentary film, about the deconstruction of a great American city, is surprisingly lyrical and often very moving.Moving from union hall to town hall, from brutal salary negotiations to contentious plans to create urban farms out of concrete wasteland, the film listens and moves on.What the movie captures overall looks like a scene from a sci-fi, postapocalyptic nightmare.At times, as Ewing and Grady\\'s cameras prowl its empty streets, the city seems like the world\\'s largest ghost town.Imagine if Frederick Wiseman and David Lynch had a bastard child, and you\\'ll get a sense of the movie\\'s off-kilter aesthetic, a potent and pointed mix of firsthand observation and surreal flights of fancy.Beautifully composed and purposefully edited to a haunting electronic score ...Detropia seems to be looking for answers, but the ones it finds are too close to the surface to be satisfying.A potent snapshot of a potential future for many American cities. The movie pays a long-overdue tribute to their glorious pipes, but also engages with the disconnection between talent and stardom, and while it isn\\'t exactly an expos?? of the music industry, infuriating details emerge.Artists including Mick Jagger talk about their backing singers -- and the soundtrack is, of course, heavenly.While there are moments in the film awkwardly placed to achieve moments of pensiveness from the talent, what it does well is offers a point of view where there wasn\\'t before.As illuminating as it is thoroughly entertaining.Joyous and uplifting ...It celebrates these women\\'s... genuine, selfless love and devotion to the music itself. And to hear that in an era of get-fame-quick shows such as The Voice, where \\'tuning\\' stars\\' voices is standard practice, gives you a genuine glow.20 Feet from Stardom, this year\\'s Oscar-winner for Best Documentary, is both rousing, upbeat fare... and a film steeped in a strange sense of yearning and regret.Consciously avoiding a Dreamgirls vibe that suggests their failure was a showbiz tragedy, Neville lets his subjects unabashedly strut their stuff.This hugely enjoyable film puts Love and others up front and centre, where we feel they belong.An enjoyable arts feature with its heart in the right place ...Such a great idea for a documentary, and such a surprise to realise that it has never been done before.As directed by Morgan Neville, who obviously adores these women, it\\'s their hopes and disappointments, triumphs and heartbreaks and fabulous, passionate personalities that takes this film to another level, and will take you with it.This is a musical field of dreams high in corn, but also, sometimes, in the epiphanic empowerment and wonder of stardom conferred.A warm and fitting tribute to talented singers.A crowdpleaser that also tells an important story about showbiz, it\\'s fab. You\\'ll come out singing.20 Feet From Stardom doesn\\'t shy away from the harder truths of the industry, but it goes down easily, and is stylishly assembled, spryly executed, and satisfyingly arced to end in triumph.It\\'s that versatility that defines these singers, the ability to make following seem as important as leading.The documentary tells similarly poignant stories in a fast-paced 91 minutes through interviews, contemporary concert footage and great archival stuff.As long as you\\'re hearing the singing and stories of Lisa Fischer, Merry Clayton, and the great Darlene Love, you can bliss out on their passion.The movie takes its cues from Standing in the Shadows of Motown, another act of pop-culture revisionism that tried to give musical credit where it was due. You won\\'t forget Cowperthwaite\\'s documentary, and you shouldn\\'t.Save the whale? After watching this documentary about the mistreatment of killer whales, you\\'ll never mock that sentiment again.A troubling expos of Sea World\\'s hazardous entertainment trade.Blackfish is a heartbreaking documentary, forensically constructed by Gabriella Cowperthwaite, about the extreme psychological distress of killer whales kept in captivity and used to entertain crowds at venues such as SeaWorld in Orlando.Blackfish makes an especially strong case for the innate marvel of these animals: that they are smart, social, communicative and loving.Gabriela Cowperthwaite\\'s eye-opening, edge-of-your-seat feature \"Blackfish\" has it all: an oversized villain, chilling attack footage, corporate malfeasance, and girls in bikinis.In the wild, orcas live between 50 and a hundred years. In captivity, it\\'s half that. It\\'s simply a strong argument to free all the Willies.There are few movies that can change the way you see the world in 83 minutes. If Blackfish is seen by enough people, it has the power to affect attendance at SeaWorld.\"Blackfish\" is a disturbing movie, one that will make you rethink parks like SeaWorld and their value.Depressingly unsurprising.Blackfish is intended to rattle and provoke in the hopes of bringing about change.\"Blackfish\" is grim. But then again, so is the plight of these magnificent, intelligent whales.Informative, earnest, but less than briskly paced.Its ultimate message is clear: Killer whales belong with their families in their natural habitat, not performing for audiences. After listening to this film\\'s many impassioned voices, it\\'s hard to argue.Blackfish marries biography, activism and psycho thriller into a pleasing cinematic shape, starting with a single whale and the trainers who worked with him.Cruelty begets cruelty and whales don\\'t belong in the circus.It not only delivers astonishing, suspenseful footage that makes it a legitimate thriller, but also serves up thoughtful meditations about using wild animals for our own entertainment.It\\'s hard to imagine anyone coming out of this movie and not swearing off the next vacation trip to Orlando, San Antonio or San Diego.Unfortunately, this feels like a ten-minute news segment blown up to theatrical proportions.While Cowperthwaite\\'s film opens with a simple question about the behavior of a single killer whale, it ends up mounting a persuasive ethical argument against keeping orcas in captivity. Brilliantly shot by Muhammad Hamdy, filled with passionate, articulate young activists.Tipped for an Oscar nomination, Jehane Noujaim\\'s kaleidoscopic documentary offers a gripping, behind-the-headlines account of Egypt\\'s 2011 Tahrir Square uprising and the complexities of its aftermath.Noujaim\\'s film attests to how quickly joyous weeping in the streets gave way to sectarian arguments over the army\\'s role and fissures in promising alliances.If the resulting film is unwieldy - five editors, five \"additional editors,\" and six assistant editors are credited - it also brims with angry urgency.The camera becomes a revolutionary: running, chasing, breathlessly jittery, up in the face of interrogators.Epitomizes nonfiction film not just as a way to deepen knowledge and understanding, but also as an art form.What does a revolution feel like from the inside? I\\'m not sure we\\'ll ever get closer than \"The Square,\" an electrifying, at times heartbreaking documentary from the Egypt-born, Harvard-educated documentarian Jehane Noujaim.It\\'s an astonishingly intimate account of an ongoing revolution, seen from within the heart of historic social upheaval; alarming, uplifting, empowering.If you want to understand what\\'s going on in Egypt right now - or simply love raw, in-depth documentaries - seek out Jehane Noujaim\\'s dissection of a revolution.It\\'s a gripping story and the fact that it isn\\'t over only makes it more extraordinary.The pace of history, at once precipitate and open-ended, is the story here. The very term \"revolution\" denotes a turning process: it isn\\'t a button push or a light switch.The extreme highs and lows of the Egyptian revolution captured in a single, astonishing documentary.Noujaim brings us right in close, often unnervingly close, to the tanks and gunfire and the chants and the tumult, but manages to forge a path through the rhetorical chaos.Jehane Noujaim\\'s \"The Square\" is a riveting, eye-opening experience, told with empathy and immediacy.The Square understands that the Revolution itself is a work in progress, and while its immediacy means it, too, will soon be superseded, it stands as a vigorous, useful account.A powerhouse documentary that takes us into the eyes of several storms.\"The Square\" bears witness to history in an articulate, thoughtful and intensely dramatic way.\"The Square\" stands as a valuable document of a tormented time, an anatomy of a revolutionary movement doomed by a paucity of viable institutions, and by the movement\\'s failure to advance a coherent agenda.\"The Square\" isn\\'t a nuanced or complete view of Egyptian politics, but it\\'s an enthralling view of fervent reformists, willing to go back to Tahrir as often as it takes.Shows the human stakes and often punishing difficulties of challenging entrenched powers and interests. In Sound City, a raucous yet sweetly romantic documentary, dinosaurs do indeed rock the Earth again.When getting into the nitty-gritty of tapes and tracks, Grohl makes a strong case for music docs directed by musicians.Dave Grohl\\'s terrific new doc, Sound City, profiles the studio where some of the greatest music of the past four decades was born.There\\'s something rock about the film\\'s messy, nostalgic imperfection.A joyous ode to a lost era of music making that will delight music buffs and those who appreciate a well-done documentary.Grohl has ... created both a fascinating account of the process of analogue recording and a tender tribute to the rock bands of yesteryear.A cocky, affectionate and very musical documentary that may make its central point a few times too often.In his directing debut, Dave Grohl shows the instincts of a real filmmaker. Sound City hits you like a shot in the heart.Even if you don\\'t know what [Grohl\\'s] talking about when he says a room gives \"great decay,\" or when somebody else extols \"24-track sensibility,\" the passion of this project really pops right out of the groove.If it doesn\\'t break any ground as a documentary, it\\'s a heartfelt testament to a place he considers among the most hallowed halls of rock.High-spirited, emotional and funny, \"Sound City\" is, of all things, a mash note to a machine. Not just any machine, however, but one that helped change the face of rock \\'n\\' roll.A celebration of just how unbelievably awesome it is to make rock music for a living - not to mention being so successful at it that you can get your childhood heroes to come over and jam.Grohl\\'s aim is to explore the aura of a place, but what he winds up proving is that people make the magic.I didn\\'t jump out of my chair and pump my fist till 24 minutes in.Dave Grohl remains unflappable as a first-time director in his entertaining and informative documentary Sound City, a loving tribute to a defunct Van Nuys recording studio.Mr. Grohl has put a lot of affection into this film, and it shows.Given Dave Grohl\\'s reputation for versatility and good taste, the film\\'s sturdy sense of forward motion may come as no surprise.Grohl treats us to just more than an hour celebrating the history of Sound City, the Van Nuys dump where a clutch of rock\\'s great records were bashed out-but the movie\\'s 107 minutes long.The first-time director smartly sees Sound City as a surrogate for the overall industry at any given point in the past four decades, and he varies the tone of the interviews from fondly-regarded serendipity to deep-seated regret.The beautiful thing here is the way Sound City enlivens some fairly snobby ideas about the glories of analog tape without resorting to mere mansplaining. This suffers as well from the fact that the subjects\\' lives haven\\'t changed all that much since 49 Up (2005); perhaps the series will improve yet as they head into old age.The original documentary was intended to illustrate how the country\\'s deeply ingrained class system inscribed itself on the aspirations and inner lives of its young people. But the successive movies have been far less polemical.We\\'re now at 56 Up,, and with each passing calendar leap, the experience of watching has only become more soul-stirring.Yes, on some level it\\'s just a seven-year check-in with people maybe half-remembered, if that. Yet the films also serve as a kind of check-in with us, too.In 49 Up, many of the series\\' subjects seemed to be just settling into their bliss; now they\\'re committed to it, and the foreclosed possibilities that come alongside.What ultimately is so compelling about 56 Up is the universality of the experiences. We were all once children. And we all will die. And in between, there is everything else.We feel good, refreshed and depressed in watching these people get older, also embarrassed in moments and cautioned about the passage of time.Apted skillfully weaves old footage with the new, and we become poignantly aware of another factor shaping their lives (and our own): biology, as the we watch the once-cute kids grow gray and heavy.Apted, himself now in his early 70s, says he hopes to continue the series further. Long may it live.Time has been neither kind nor cruel to the 13 men and women profiled in \"56 UP.\" It has just been time, which is what this groundbreaking series is about.We are all older now, and this series proves it in a most deeply moving way.Inevitably, one looks in the mirror afterward and thinks, What have I lost? What have I gained? And at what cost?To see \"56 Up\" is to be reunited with an old friend.\"56 Up\" reminds us that change is ceaseless and often dramatic, bringing growth we could never have dreamed of as little kids.Apted creates a graceful back-and-forth from the earlier films to the present, and the experience of seeing people who have lived so much on screen is quite profound.The effect is often profoundly moving, but you can\\'t help but feel at times like there are other stories here you\\'re missing.What gives the series its force is not just its universality but also its particularity. These grown-ups may be Everyman, but they are also singular.\"56 Up\" is a rather bittersweet chapter, as age begins to further narrow those possibilities already defined at birth. And it hints that \"63 Up,\" if we get there, may be sadder still.\\'56 Up\" is as good a point as any to get hooked on the magnificent half-century series of documentaries ...These are moving images of touchingly vibrant lives at certain moments in time and space. The Act of Killing is the only 100% original work of cinema to come out this year.If Oppenheimer\\'s aim is to question and investigate what life the past has in the present, he has succeeded in a staggeringly original way.[An] innovative piece of filmmaking so breathtakingly daring and powerful, it replaces your oxygen with awe.Once you grasp just what is being enacted on the screen, The Act of Killing becomes something like a candy-colored moral migraine. An existential nausea is inevitable.The shock of the final scene must be left unspoken; suffice to say its impact exceeds even the nightmarish queasiness which this brilliant and horrible film has striven to contain.The emotionally manipulative use of some of the material raises all kinds of questions about veracity.The Act of Killing works brilliantly on many levels, capturing like no other documentary I have seen, like no other film I can imagine, the fevered insanity of those days.The originality of The Act of Killing lies in Oppenheimer\\'s decision to treat artifice as a roundabout path to truth.Bizarre, hypnotic, audacious.The emotional places this troubling movie takes him to are rewardingly primal and potent, forcing both subject and viewer to wrestle with internal demons.I certainly do not move that the film should be suppressed, only that one should know what it is. It is a bath in a smiling madness.This stunning \"documentary of the imagination\" shows Anwar and other thugs staging scenes of torture and murder for the camera.In The Act of Killing, director Joshua Oppenheimer pulls off the impossible: He confronts great, incomprehensible evil and puts a human face on it.This film is jaw-dropping. It\\'s a must-see.The Act of Killing allows the victors a forum to elaborate on their story, and, by their own hands, these aged conquerors unwittingly rewrite aspects of the history that has propped them up for so many decades.Joshua Oppenheimer\\'s documentary interviews leaders of Indonesian death squads responsible for deaths of millions & has them re-enact the killings. The combination of drama therapy and accidental self-exposure - utterly bizarre, unexpected and valuable.[A] unique and unforgettable documentary.The acts it describes are shocking, the world it shows is shocking and the filmmaking itself is shocking. This is not a film easily forgotten.Directors Joshua Oppenheimer and Christine Cynn have created something extraordinary in The Act of Killing, the much-talked-about documentary about torture and murder during the Indonesian dictatorship of the \\'60s and \\'70s.A horrifying yet mesmerizing work, \"The Act of Killing\" instructively meanders at times as in a Werner Herzog film. For patient science-minded kids and adults, it should find the sweet spot between environmental advocacy and visual pleasure.The movie compensates for its murkier sections with a poignant outlook.It\\'s pretty clear that Imhoof is not a fan of US industrial-scale farming but rather than shove angry stats such as \\'80 per cent of plants rely on bee pollination\\' in your face, he prefers to fascinate viewers.Markus Imhoof\\'s bee documentary is so stuffed with surreal tableaux it makes your head spin.It is the elegance of its images that sets it apart from previous doomed bee documentaries. The footage of individual animals going about their business is a sight to behold.Eye-popping photography should draw viewers to this thoughtful, revealing doc.An interesting, and interestingly laidback film, an almost restful look at honeybees and the way they are kept and cultivated across the world.You come out of the film none the wiser as to where the bees have all gone. But you still learn a hell of a lot about them.Elegant, handsomely shot and often instructive, and its remarkable extended close-up sequences of bees\\' social structure are fascinating.Summer\\'s blitz of apocalypse movies has nothing on this bee doc.Informative and occasionally scary.Oblique narrative aside, you can\\'t beat the film\\'s eye-popping visuals.What\\'s really frightening about Honey isn\\'t what a hive of angry bees might do to us, but what we\\'ve done to them.[Markus] Imhoof makes bees more important than they have previously seemed.Imhoof\\'s film is remarkable in its close-up photography. The bees loom large, like creatures from some mutant planet; dangle together in a delicate chain; and fill the air, floating like unusually vivid dust specks.Markus Imhoof\\'s inventive and powerful documentary ...Most striking in \"Honey\" are closeups of the bees in their hives, symbiotically working together in creating their new queen: Imhoof rightfully spends time detailing the extraordinary nature of bee social structure.Without any preachiness, this magically beautiful film urges us to take better care of the bees, and honor the irreplaceable things that they do for us.An amiably shaggy combination of science lesson, whimsical musing and alarm bell ...As a nature doc, More Than Honey rivals such acclaimed forebears as Winged Migration and Microcosmos, though it\\'s working with a more limited scope, visually-if you\\'ve seen one honeybee, you\\'ve seen \\'em all. It\\'s fitting that the first track we hear in this celebratory but emotionally dappled documentary is Wilson Pickett\\'s Land of 1000 Dances. The rich, elemental energy of the recording encapsulates what would become known as the Muscle Shoals sound.Even with its disappointments, Muscle Shoals can\\'t help but make a hopeful sound.Hall\\'s backstory, riddled with tragedy, gets the proper attention and respect here. But it\\'s the music that won\\'t let you stop watching.Camalier makes an excellent job of combining talking-head interviews with music, anecdotes and folklore.A galaxy of stars recall the magic of it all, although a little less boring Bono would have been a bonus.And lo, the musical miscegenation was good.The anecdotes work without the music, but if you like the music... Dang, it\\'s a stairway to heaven.A stubborn charmer whose life was a magnet for tragedy, Hall is the emotional centre not only of the Muscle Shoals sound but of this film.The movie is more a collection of cool people telling great stories than it is a structured documentary (despite Camalier\\'s attempts in that direction). But in this case, that\\'s enough.Director Greg \"Freddy\" Camalier augments the talking heads with unusually evocative vistas ...Exceptional music, unexceptional documentary on the swampy sounds of the famous Tennessee backing band.Occasionally baggy, always sincere, this is an essential document of a defining era when \\'soul\\' really meant something.A stomping good doc.Even casual music fans will enjoy behind-the-hits doc.Greg Camalier\\'s debut feature offers a worthy if sometimes ponderous take on a significant slice of U.S. popular music history.What makes the documentary Muscle Shoals so fine besides a kicking soundtrack? Well first, there\\'s its deep sense of place.Muscle Shoals may not appeal to every generation\\'s musical tastes, but for those of you who love that sweet soul music and crave that ol\\' time rock & roll, believe me: It\\'s just the ticket.It is hands down one of the best music documentaries ever made.A mesmerizing documentary ...Like 20 Feet From Stardom, another standout music doc of 2013, Muscle Shoals skillfully shines a light on unheralded musicians whose names usually are not illuminated. Sorting through those secrets through Polley\\'s candid interviews with her father, family members, and close family friends is fascinating to watch.Deeply affectionate and sometimes very moving.If a personal memoir film by a beautiful, successful young woman from a nice Toronto family sounds to you like it can only be an excuse for self-absorbed navel-gazing, well, you must not have seen a Sarah Polley movie yet.Stories We Tell is one of those movies you watch on a screen and replay in your head for days, moving between its many levels of inquiry and touched, always, by Polley\\'s compassion toward her relatives in particular and people in general.The opposite of a courageous piece of work, Stories We Tell goes out of its way to protect every single person it touches.Sarah Polley\\'s remarkable Stories We Tell transcends every cliche in this confessional/investigatory genre, and it\\'s one of the year\\'s highlights.Polley\\'s ability to uncover truth and to present it for public consumption is bold and brave, and bodes well for her (hopefully) continued doc career.Stories We Tell, uniquely, reveals its process as if we are thinking, sifting and selecting along with the filmmaker.Polley\\'s portrait of modern family life is a playfully profound discussion of narrative forms - the way in which we each construct our own reality through stories, part truth, part invention.A decent piece of work, but too fussy for its own good.Polley is working in the tradition of Orson Welles, but her trickery can be exasperating; it also neutralises many of the emotional revelations.What saves it is our realisation that it isn\\'t just a documentary.A bittersweet and compelling autobiographical family portrait.Kane-like in its mirrored complexity, flashing in its mischievous irony, the story is a shiny maze which Polley enters knowing exactly where and what her Minotaur is - the secret of her paternal parentage - while spinning for us a thread to follow.Polley ... smilingly tells us that a story like hers can never truly be tied down, even as she screws every last piece into place.Polley\\'s cine-tribute is a gripping and absorbing meditation on the unknowability of other lives.Everyone has a different story. I found myself holding my breath listening to them talk. The story twists like a thriller.Polley\\'s fearless personal journey is a huge achievement, a genuine revelation - but the less detail you know beforehand, the better. Go in cold, come out warmed.Stories We Tell is not just very moving; it is an exploration of truth and fiction that will stay with you long after repeated viewings.As with her other films, when Sarah Polley takes it upon herself to tell us a story, you can bet it\\'s a tale well-told and one that you\\'ll want to hear. A necessary, yet cinematic call for action.Call Me Kuchu leaves you flabbergasted by its portrait of the persecution of gay men and lesbians in Uganda.It\\'s a lesson in courage, in being determined to enjoy one\\'s life even as the authorities threaten to take it away.The film is impassioned and powerful but not frenzied, riling the viewers\\' emotions without giving in to them itself.Stirring, heartbreaking and thoroughly infuriating ...Both Senyonjo and Kato light up the screen.This alternately harrowing and inspirational doc puts a human face on the fight for gay rights in Uganda.Horrific and uplifting ...I\\'ll be surprised if any other movie this year affects me as much.A scary but inspiring film with real heroes and villains.The very best - and, alas, the very worst - of human nature is captured in this heartbreaking and inspiring documentary from Katherine Fairfax Wright and Malika Zouhali-Worrall.Apart from its laudable goal of raising awareness, the film doesn\\'t have much to offer.Equally gut-wrenching and inspiring, the documentary Call Me Kuchu beams right from Uganda, the global hypocenter in the ongoing and intensifying struggle over LGBT rights.It\\'s far too soon for a happy ending, but in praising Kato\\'s bravery, Call Me Kuchu at least points to the potential for one.The film provides welcome context for the semi-hysteria that recently took over the U.S. media in regard to Uganda\\'s \"Kill the Gays\" bill.While a local filmmaker\\'s perspective may have brought more dimensions, the coverage of events here is impressive and on the mark.Such horror, such bravery.The palpable sense of loss and grief testify to how the film-makers have turned what could have been a detached news report into a moving human tragedy.Call Me Kuchu, a documentary about homophobia in Uganda, lifts a rock in that country and discovers the insect life ruling it.An essential film in the pursuit of civil liberty and the fight against fascism. Do the Kabbalist readings or wild free associations that Room 237 celebrates improve The Shining? Let\\'s say that they create a parallel text: Lost in the Overlook, in search of the overlooked.Don\\'t watch this film and expect an authoritative critical analysis of the film; watch it and explore the distorting, drug-like pull that some art can exert on its audience.A curious and entertaining documentary.The human brain is a marvellously suggestible organ.[A] strange, frustrating, occasionally fascinating doc ...There\\'s enough real evidence supporting the theory that Kubrick was a genius, and that\\'s pretty entertaining all by itself.It\\'s about the human need for stuff to make sense - especially overpowering emotional experiences - and the tendency for some people to take that sense-making to extremes.The results can range from enlightening - Kubrick did like to mess with things - to embarrassing. But it\\'s never dull. \"Room 237\" shines.You don\\'t have to buy any of the nutty theories in Room 237 to appreciate what director Rodney Ascher has accomplished.It\\'s nuts, in the best possible way.Their imaginings are not far removed from the deconstuctionist gobbledygook that has hammerlocked academic film and literary scholarship. But here at least the gobbledygook is entertaining.I suspect that Ascher\\'s intention was to dynamize an academic exercise, but these constant, sundry inserts render the tone as corny and glib as a VH1 special.[It] may be the surpassingly eccentric-and enormously entertaining-film that Kubrick deserves.\"Room 237\" is an act of uncommon devotion to cinema, embracing the notion that movies are best defined by what happens to us as we watch them - how our own beliefs and experiences dictate our interpretation of what we\\'ve seen and heard.This is sure to amuse you if you get a bang out of the claims that Paul McCartney died in 1966 and Dark Side of the Moon was intended as a soundtrack for The Wizard of Oz.I found most of what\\'s actually put forth in the film interpretively ridiculous. But I\\'m just one theorist among millions, and the film worked for me anyway.Listening to fanatics go on and on about their fixations can be kind of fun. For a while, at least.As amusing as the movie is, I think in the end that Ascher misses the labyrinth for the trees.The theories proposed in the doc \"Room 237\" aren\\'t eye-opening. They\\'re laughable.A beautifully edited, deeply strange compendium of what different people have read into a single film. Six smart, tough guys, tightly framed and talking to the camera: Israeli filmmaker Dror Moreh\\'s compelling Oscar-nominated doc The Gatekeepers gives the voice of experience a human face.With such incendiary opinion on offer, it might have been a temptation for Moreh to lay out these testimonies end to end... What makes the film so satisfying, though, is the appreciable craft with which the material is organized and presented.Moreh\\'s interviewees span generations, from elder statesman Avraham Shalom (mastermind of the 1960 Adolf Eichmann grab) to most recent spook-in-chief Yuval Diskin. Each displays a disarming mix of even-voiced candor and respect for talk-it-out diplomacy.There is a powerful moment in [the film] when Diskin, head of the Shin Bet from 2005 to 2011, candidly remarks that for the Palestinians he is himself a terrorist. That is not relativism but realism, and the welcome sign of an empathetic imagination.Dror Moreh\\'s terrific documentary can stand beside Errol Morris\\'s The Fog of War as a cinematic illustration of how human psyches bend beneath the pressure of terrible actions.[Moreh] asks just the right questions, never prodding these understandably private men too far but getting what he needs.The film, though based on the exploits of Shin Bet, gives us reason to think about the drones that take out more than just terrorists.Makes for truly bracing viewing.A compelling overview of a modern security agency - bred in a moral grey area, organising state-sanctioned violence, but uncertain of the strength of its political safety net.While memorable in sometimes unexpected ways (1980 head Avraham Shalom\\'s long unwashed nails), there is always the nagging feeling that any revelations are being pushed or sold a little too hard.Insightful, revelatory and profound, Moreh\\'s Oscar-nominated documentary combines riveting interviews, archive footage and - yes - state-of-the-art photographic effects to offer a unique perspective on the Israel-Palestine issue.The rule of surveillance is to keep quiet and let others do the talking. The Oscar-nominated documentary The Gatekeepers flips the script, to astonishing effect, giving voice to the retired directors of Shin Bet, Israel\\'s domestic intelligence agency.The film and its talking head participants paint the picture in both broad strokes and fine detail.Whatever one\\'s political stripe regarding Israel, it\\'s hard to dispute the impressions and perspective of the film\\'s six eyewitnesses.The level of candor here may not satisfy hard-liners of either stripe, but it can help viewers begin to formulate new questions about the philosophical, strategic and moral challenges of conflict, in particular \"wars on terror.\"Ultimately the movie feels evasive, and its flashy, digitally animated re-creations of military surveillance footage unpleasantly evoke the Call of Duty video games.It offers startlingly honest insight into the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from some of those who called the shots.As a political testament, the result is revealing and important.A monolith crumbles in The Gatekeepers, and it\\'s a sight to inspire awe.As a clear-eyed examination of a conflict that seems to have no end, The Gatekeepers is powerful, provocative stuff. After seeing the film premiere at SXSW, I asked a Divine-devotee friend of mine why she loves Divine so much. She simply said, \"Because Divine\\'s the original.\" If it wasn\\'t already obvious, Schwartz\\'s I Am Divine cements it.It\\'s surprisingly moving stuff - dressed up with just enough archival outrage to remind you how scandalous Divine once seemed.The interviewees and even his mother, with whom he was reconciled late in his life, all portray him as a generous and very sweet-natured man.This is, for the most part, a celebration of Divine\\'s life unencumbered by guilt or oppression.Schwarz offsets the camp with a sincere appreciation of both the obvious, larger-than-life personality and this performer\\'s oft-overlooked skills ...Touching and funny. Waters fans should sign up now.This is divine.I Am Divine riffs entertainingly through the career of the drag star who blazed in Pink Flamingoes and Hairspray.A glimpse of a surprisingly shy and gentle soul who longed to be a star.It\\'s hard to go wrong with a movie about famed drag queen Divine, and director Jeffrey Schwarz certainly doesn\\'t in \"I Am Divine,\" a serious documentary about this gloriously trashy trailblazer.In \"I Am Divine,\" bolstered by plentiful interviews with Waters and other collaborators, Schwarz effectively turns Milstead into the life of a party that didn\\'t really end with his death in 1988.Filled with heady outrageousness at the same time it continuously skirts the apparent emptiness in the man wearing those crazy wigs.Schwarz understands Divine, a heroine to outsiders, and Glenn, who took the persona as far as he could and was ready for new roles. His film\\'s celebratory pizazz suits them both.The Pink Flamingos star Divine gets her own well-deserved spotlight.Entertaining doc is sweeter than expected and will be an eye-opener for young fans.Sincere but overly reverential.Even if this overly respectful movie never goes quite deep enough, it does shows us the man behind the garish eye shadow, the lost boy under the Totie Fields wig.A fine, touching tribute to John Waters\\' larger-than-life drag diva ...Divine expanded the concept of the drag queen from brash female impersonator into something much larger, more subversive and less gender specific.In Milstead\\'s brief 42 years there were separations and reunions, stumbles, success and, finally, a real American family, in movies oddly ahead of their time. Charming, funny with a particular fondness that is moving to watch, it is not to be missed.This charming feature doc offers an anatomy of a marriage.For all its miseries, Cutie and the Boxer - interweaving archive footage with contemporary discontents - ends up arguing strongly for the power of love.The couple are thriving, but, given what we learn about Alex, the up-beat ending jars.This doc about a bickering husband-and-wife artist team feels like its drama has been forced by the filmmakers.Bohemianism and marriage are both for life in this alternately rueful and whimsical documentary about expat Japanese artist couple Ushio and Noriko Shinohara.The film is both touching and funny.It\\'s a touching film and a fascinating glimpse into one of those couples you can\\'t quite believe are still together.A painful, powerful portrait of the struggle and sacrifice required to create, and the cost that it can demand.The story of an extraordinary marriage between two people bound together by their artistic impulse.A lively double portrait of Ushio and Noriko Shinohara, two Brooklyn-based artists who, after 40 years of marriage, are still creating side by side, and tormenting each other.More than anything, the film expresses - at an almost subconscious level - the difficulties of discerning not only what real art is, but also what true love is all about.Intriguing as their present lives may be, without enough background to appreciate, for instance, Ushio\\'s associations with Rauschenberg and Warhol, we can\\'t gauge the full extent of the couple\\'s regrets and losses.Heinzerling allows us to read whatever we want into this picture. The endless struggle for money and professional recognition is either a curse or a raison d\\'tre.\"Cutie and the Boxer\" takes this tale of two artists and tells it with style and wit ...Their 40-year marriage seems like more of a trial than this overweening, lightly likable movie acknowledges.Directed with invention and insight by Zachary Heinzerling ...Slyly comments on the ironies of the past half century in contemporary art.Movies twice as long are often half as eloquent.The film neither simplifies the troubled relationship nor pushes us to take sides, but asks us to observe the complexities of their life together. The only problem is that, with so much fascinating material to cover, The Crash Reel skips over half of it.Jawdropping and jawbreaking stunts performed by professional snowboarders open Lucy Walker\\'s latest documentary, but it is the aftermath of accidents that form the powerfully disturbing core of the film.Lucy Walker\\'s documentary is exhilarating and grim viewing.Few documentaries manage to show character arcs as full as the one Walker captures here.Another memorable piece of storytelling from the Oscar-winning director.The hook of The Crash Reel is that it\\'s about the rivalry between two famous American snowboarders, but in reality, Lucy Walker\\'s slickly produced documentary is about one man\\'s ongoing battle with himself -- on and off the slopes.Ms. Walker doesn\\'t go too deeply into the questions all this raises, but at least she broaches them. Are the sponsors of these athletes promoting recklessness by encouraging stars to push the limits?Amidst all the trauma that had me crying more than once throughout the film...I was amazed by the incredible feats performed by the athletes.The tale of a modern-day Icarus. His wings didn\\'t melt, but his brain cracked. He lived, but he learned to question the trip.Much more than a sports film, Lucy Walker\\'s Oscar-shortlisted The Crash Reel is a thrilling, inspiring, yet cautionary tale about extreme sports that never trades on sentiment.Director Lucy Walker\\'s chronicle of how Pearce, his family and his friends grapple with their altered reality results in one of the year\\'s best documentaries.While there is an actual \"crash reel\" in the film, the title speaks more to Pearce\\'s interminable sense of reeling.With its high-energy music and graffiti-style graphics, The Crash Reel plays like the slick promos NBC uses to repackage every Olympian\\'s story into a pat narrative.The Crash Reel movingly captures the athlete\\'s difficult acceptance of the fact that he can no longer practice the sport that made him a world champion.It compellingly captures a family wrestling mightily with the riddles and contradictions of a culture that promotes achievement at all costs with little thought as to what that actually means.With no miraculous recovery to fall back on, the story simply has nowhere to go. And that\\'s precisely the point.As thrilling as Rush, but with a very different kind of happy ending.The charm of director Lucy Walker\\'s creation is she allows the sport that elevated Pearce to take the audience on a ride too.The film captures the horror and danger and the druggy thrill. We understand why these kids want their \"highs\" even when the cost of coming low can be fatal.Lucy Walker has assembled one of the great sporting docs - partly because its scope extends beyond the slopes. An especially pointed variation on one of music\\'s most oft-told tales: A band formed ahead of its time sits in muffled obscurity while others reap the harvest of what it first planted.Fortunately, Bobby and Dannis, the surviving brothers, prove genial company.If the brothers seem a little drunk on their own myth, they\\'re also genuinely humbled by the band\\'s rediscovery and warmed by the fact that their kids have carried on the family tradition.A Band Called Death shines the light on a previously unexplored corner of musical history and does it in an accessible, straightforward manner.Death never got very far, and their story is a fascinating one, told beautifully by Jeff Howlett and Mark Christopher Covino.Their story can feel almost too ready-made for the telling, but it\\'s well worth a listen.The story of Death sure adds an interesting and virtually unknown footnote to the annals of punk rock.... a must-watch for fans of punk music, vinyl record wonks, or even those interested ... a visionary entertainment dream.[A] generous, spirited documentary [that captures] one of the strangest and most inspiring of all family stories of tragedy and triumph that this crazy country has produced.It was fans\\' ardor that began the Death revival and propels the movie\\'s exhilarating second half.If you\\'re looking for a 96-minute jolt of joy, look no further than this uplifting, well-made documentary ...The film is nothing much cinematically, and some of the narrative details and circumstances seemed fudged. But it\\'s a great story, told with a fan\\'s honest appreciation.If ever a movie about punk deserved to be called legitimately sweet and life-affirming, it\\'s the documentary \"A Band Called Death.\"A beautiful tale of life, love, music, and family, of things not working out but also working out just as predicted.By the end, \"A Band Called Death\" doesn\\'t just uncover a new chapter in punk history. It lets you to experience it.These docs often conclude with some sort of triumphant reunion tour, but it\\'s more heartwarming than usual to see children paying tribute to their parents by covering their ancient songs.Captures the joy of music, the remarkable influence it can have on future talents, and the importance of appeasing nothing but the creative drive within.The film is made impetuously watchable and disarmingly emotional by the filmmakers\\' strong command of docudrama and nonfiction narrative style.A new wrinkle on Andy Warhol\\'s maxim: Eventually, every undiscovered band will receive its own righteous documentary, lapped up by a bin-trawling audience (and a festival circuit ready to serve them).This rock doc rewrites punk history while telling an emotional story about an artist\\'s spirit and his faithful family. [A] most compelling documentaries focused directly on the issues of intellectual property rights and definitions of privacy and secrecy in the digital age.Words on the screen, their power to free you, and also entrap you - if this isn\\'t the internet\\'s deadly blessing, what is?Having recently released documentaries on clerical abuse, Mario Cuomo, Park Avenue, Lance Armstrong and, now, WikiLeaks, Gibney seems in danger of becoming an actualit?? machine.We Steal Secrets is much concerned with conspiracy theories and may well wind up fuelling new ones.A thorough and decently intentioned work, though it accepts a little too glibly the more-in-sorrow-than-in-anger line against Assange: that he is a fascinating radical who simply became a paranoid authoritarian.This is saying something important. Check your Facebook settings.This is an expertly organised documentary; Gibney\\'s always are.[]This thorough, engrossing film shows how idealistic Aussie hacker Julian Assange took on the might of the US, exposing their military and diplomatic misconduct, then allowed his own murky personal life to tarnish his credibility.Alex Gibney adds to his forensic examinations of Enron and Abu Ghraib with another fine documentary.Sometimes it takes a feature-length documentary to stitch together a story we think we already know.A psychological suspense film with an open ending that\\'s more haunting than the tricky climaxes of most post-Hitchcock thrillers.A real-life cyber-thriller with real-life consequences, Alex Gibney\\'s We Steal Secrets: The Story of WikiLeaks is a riveting and revelatory documentary ...Gibney builds a remarkable level of suspense, given how exhaustively WikiLeaks has been covered in the media.Engaging, kinetic, revelatory and unexpected.At once an awkward mingling of two complex life stories and a gripping, necessary look at how information is gathered, shared and, yes, stolen.Who is \"We\" in the title We Steal Secrets? There\\'s no need for a spoiler alert, but it\\'s neither Gibney nor Assange.Despite its wonky-Washington theme, We Steal Secrets ends up being a surprisingly soulful and, yes, even moving story of hubris, good intentions and mistakes.The sequence in which Manning confides in former hacker Adrian Lamo and gets turned in to the FBI supplies the kind of human drama that has made Gibney\\'s work so engrossing in the past.Who decides what stays secret? This brilliant documentary explores that question, itself a meta-narrative as the documentarian exposes the secrets of the secret-sharers. Astonishment abounds in doc about card-trick genius.We want to know as much as we can about this guy, but like any good magician, he keeps things shadowy and hard to pin down.The film offers all manner of mind-blowing tricks, as well as a colorful history of the evolution of magic and illusions, especially through the 20th century.Jay\\'s own personality and intellect steer the film, and he\\'s such a finely honed performer that he easily carries it off...What we get here, simply, is time spent with Ricky Jay, and that\\'s time well spent.Molly Bernstein and Alan Edelstein\\'s film works first and foremost as a showcase of Jay\\'s skills, but he\\'s also an ideal interview subject ...A documentary portrait of the magician, author and actor who is known as one of today\\'s preeminent practitioners of close-up magic.For heaven\\'s sake! Another documentary I didn\\'t know I was waiting for-and am equally glad to see.The magic in this documentary portrait of actor and stage illusionist Ricky Jay comes mainly from his fond recollections of old performers.Ricky Jay only lets you see what he wants you to see when he\\'s on stage. Doesn\\'t it make sense that a film about him would be similarly elusive? And sometimes even magical?The larger subjects, eloquently evoked, are the sources of his knowledge and inspiration, and the singular tradition within which he works and flourishes.Fittingly, there\\'s a lot to try to keep track of in \"Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay.\"It reveals the philosophy behind Jay\\'s art, a view of life that examines illusions from every which way, and finds meaning in the magic.Ricky Jay is the master of a discipline he created: trickster, archivist, showman and raconteur rolled into one.This documentary provides an elegant, enthralling peek behind the curtain and into the you-won\\'t-trust-your-eyes world of this celebrated contemporary conjurer.\"Deceptive Practice\" lets us peer up close at what he\\'s doing - camera tight on the cards, Jay\\'s sleeves pushed up - and we still don\\'t know how he does it; for lack of a better phrase, it\\'s like magic.Aside from some references to misdirection, Jay offers no clue as to how he pulls off illusions with sleight of hand, but he performs them with such panache that you have little choice but to suspend disbelief.To be able to find, nurture and share one\\'s passion with such unceasing enthusiasm is surely the essence of magic itself.In Deceptive Practices, the entertainer pays his mentors and inspirations the ultimate tribute by turning a film ostensibly about himself into one fundamentally about all of them.He always holds a card you don\\'t see.It\\'s magic, pure and simple. It\\'s a grim story.A laudably even-handed examination of a highly charged subject.The story of four women and their attempts to uphold abortion rights in the US makes for compelling, if horrifying viewing.You may or may not be convinced, but you will be affected.\"After Tiller\" does viewers the great service of providing light where there\\'s usually only heat, giving a human face and heart to what previously might have been an abstract issue or quickly scanned news item.What makes this well-edited film compelling are the stories of the patients and the agonizing moral quandaries that the doctors express in doing their work.It\\'s a calm, thoughtful film about an incendiary subject, and it has a clear point of view: to allow these doctors (and some of their patients, who we hear but don\\'t see) to explain why they do what they do.This wrenching documentary, profiling the four doctors who still provide third-trimester abortions in the U.S., is remarkable for being so level-headed.After Tiller movingly dramatizes another side effect of the job: how difficult it can be for the doctors to not internalize the sadness of the women who walk through their doors.The movie takes a calm and intellectual approach to an inflammatory subject, elevating what could have easily come off as propaganda into a reasoned and thoughtful work of journalism.It\\'s humanizing and heartbreaking.The film is a welcome exploration of practical and philosophical matters seldom broached across the partisan divide.After Tiller takes a compassionate look at a highly impassioned situation.A surprisingly warm abortion documentary that restores the human element to an irreducibly human dilemma.After Tiller\\'s greatest failing is the way in which is fails to engage at length how entrenched the stalemate on abortion is.\"After Tiller\" takes the politically divisive, emotionally charged issue of late-term abortions and portrays it with grace, understatement and humanity.\"After Tiller\" is groundbreaking in giving voice not only to the doctors, but to those who always seem to get overlooked in the high-volume political debate about this topic: the women themselves.\"After Tiller\" is impressive because it honestly presents the views of supporters of legal abortion, and is thus a valuable contribution to a public argument that is unlikely to end anytime soon.After Tiller\\'s...true value comes from going inside these clinics, listening to the stories...and asking viewers to wrestle with the moral and ethical complexities of an issue that absolutists on both sides oversimplify.After Tiller is an hour and a half of folks on their best behavior, presented as a candid portrait. In terms of providing a historical narrative of the Riot Grrl scene, The Punk Singer does an adequate, yet rushed job within an 80-minute film.While exciting for the sheer range of archival visual material it employs to tell Hanna\\'s story, The Punk Singer is even more significant for capturing just how relevant the ideological pulse of Riot Grrrl is today.The film, with its zine-like construction, is a whistle-stop tour of the fun stuff, of Hanna\\'s highs, and above all, a personal portrait of one girl\\'s ambition to create a space for herself in the front.It is a love letter to Kathleen Hanna, to feminism, and to the fans, but it\\'s also just a damn good movie.Both a captivating personal story and a history of a moment - as the best rock documentaries are.Anderson\\'s film -- a scrappy, exuberant battler like its subject -- shows how Hanna has transmuted a hunger borne of body-image pressure into a hunger to change the world.[A] terrifically watchable and impressively empowering documentary ...Kathleen Hanna, former lead singer of Bikini Kill, comes across as an inspirational figure in Sini Anderson\\'s rousing documentary.She\\'s a real role model, and her mysterious withdrawal in 2005 - explained as due to undiagnosed Lyme disease - left a vacuum that\\'s still conspicuously unfilled.A rousing celebration of the creative and political life of outspoken Riot grrrl icon, Kathleen Hanna.Initially held together by grainy VHS footage and cuttings from old fanzines, the film is gifted with a protagonist of endless brio and a cultural backdrop just distant enough to feel forgotten.It\\'s the music, though, including a wealth of galvanic performance footage from the Bikinis, particularly, that really makes this worth seeing. It\\'s killer stuff indeed.It is not the most subtly layered documentary I\\'ve ever seen, but these days it\\'s no longer verboten to take a stance in docs. And there is so much to be admired about Hanna.The way Hanna burst onto the scene is just as interesting as how she faded from it.The movie succeeds as a punk chronicle by focusing on a true believer who was lionized by many but who turned out to be only human.The contradiction between status-quo film style and punk-rock subject never comes close to being resolved, but then Hanna herself is a bundle of contradictions.The Punk Singer (and the formation of the Julie Ruin) offers a welcome return to, if not the fray, then certainly the front - where, as every rebel girl worth her combat boots knows, girls belong.\"The Punk Singer\" is a revealing look at Hanna\\'s life, who throughout the film is willing to speak out about her struggles and triumphs in an open and honest way.Where are the riot-grrrls of today? Take your daughters to the movie, then ask them.The Punk Singer is assembled well, moving efficiently through the most important pieces of Hanna\\'s biography...while Hanna and her friends explain the significance. A capably done account of a presidential career that was wrecked by a crime that was unnecessary.The result is maudlin beyond belief, especially Nixon\\'s farewell to the aides he\\'s in the process of firing, but other moments simply register as shockingly out of touch.[A] shrewdly edited collection of news footage and \"home movies\" taken by members of the Nixon White House staff ...We get to see film of daughter Tricia\\'s wedding (her father is a surprisingly agile ballroom dancer) and other oddities.Often plays like a mortifying companion to the Nixon-period sitcom \"The Wonder Years.\"There has never been an uninteresting angle on Richard Nixon - the man was too twisted - but Penny Lane\\'s documentary sees him from several especially compelling new vantages.[S]hows the precise moment when new image technology would alter power.Mundane movies of events like the president\\'s daughter\\'s wedding and his groundbreaking trip to China are juxtaposed with Nixon\\'s rants about his enemies and the \"homosexuals\" he believed were leading the US into decline.It\\'s an exploration of the banality of evil that constantly puts banality first, but this is a relatively narrow experimental film designed to supplement rather than replace more thorough histories.Our Nixon shows that while the stooges were good at scheming (up until Watergate, at least) they sucked as filmmakers.The results are akin to seeing the Nixon presidency through the eyes of his top aides; it\\'s as much a portrait of innocence lost as a behind-closed-doors expos.The real takeaway here is a tone of dawning tragedy, sourness sneaking into even the most innocuous of visual records.More entertaining curio than revelatory document.Efficient found-footage collage is more evocative than revelatory.It evokes a such crazy quilt of emotions and memories that children all over America are going to be wondering why their grandparents are crying or throwing shoes at the TV or both.Our Nixon is a love song to a man who knew victories but just couldn\\'t win.It just feels redundant. Perhaps little or nothing on the home movies lent itself to a richer portrait.The retrieved home movie footage creates a lambent prism through which the \\'70s seem like a simpler time. It also makes Our Nixon a uniquely dynamic time capsule.After two hours, Nixon remains a riveting enigma.A brisk, eye-opening documentary about the Nixon White House, this triumph of editing is composed of homemovies, accompanied by later TV interviews and priceless audio from the secret tapes, making it a must-see for anyone interested in Americana. Reich is a natural teacher of complex concepts: The film doesn\\'t feel like homework.Inequality for All is intelligent, persuasive and accessible, a gentle but urgent clarion call to action.[Robert Reich] headlines this documentary in which he explains his views about the United States\\' current economic woes. It\\'s something he manages to do engagingly and with great clarity.Overall, this film is enlightening, entertaining and seriously alarming.This documentary would be a rousing David and Goliath story even if its hero weren\\'t the diminutive Robert B. Reich.An advocacy doc constructed to make a clear political point first and function as a film a distant second.That a documentary about economics could be so personally emotional and affecting is remarkable. And to learn from Reich in this film, as his students at Berkeley do, is a treat and a privilege.Robert Reich, a secretary of labor under President Clinton, leads us through a sharp-eyed essay-meditation on the rising trend of income inequality.Reich manages to infuse this enlightening/infuriating documentary on extreme income disparity in the United States, and the corollary marginalization of the middle class, with an optimistic spirit. One that may or may not be justified.Any politician hoping to redistribute America\\'s wealth should screen it before every stump speech.Filmmaker Kornbluth personalizes this story by using Reich\\'s warmth and humor to win us over and keep his presentation from becoming a dry recitation of facts.It\\'s unseemly, I know, to praise a movie like this for the stand-up-comic affability of its host. But Reich\\'s engagingness also gives credence to the seriousness of his message.Reich is no condescending intellectual. He has no contempt for people of the opposite point of view. He even has nice things to say about Bill O\\'Reilly.Reich is funny, poignant, passionate.A cinematic listicle of misleading economic talking points.If you like your movie stars to be smart, engaging, well-spoken, self-deprecating and Danny DeVito-size, you couldn\\'t do much better than this leading authority on economics who served under presidents Ford, Carter and Clinton.Mr. Reich ties together his talking points with a reasonable-sounding analysis and an unassuming warmth sometimes absent from documentaries charting America\\'s economic woes.The film is as much about Reich as income inequality, a topic he has written and talked about for decades. You\\'ll learn why he\\'s 4 feet 10.5 inches tall and why he became active in social politics.If you\\'re looking for a streamlined explanation for the mess the U.S. economy\\'s in, and how we might get out, it\\'s as good a place to start as any.This lively film takes a \"greatest-hits\" approach to Reich, who fears that we\\'re headed for another financial debacle if we don\\'t take a more serious approach to taxes and education. While the film stays true to the individual accounts, it doesn\\'t shy away from the complex political issues behind hunger that affect all of us.[A] revelatory new documentary about hunger in the United States.Hunger in America is not about a shortage of food but an abundance of poverty. This is where the spiral spins downward.A shocking indictment of how people are starving in the land of plenty ...You don\\'t have to be a fan of info-graphics in social-justice docs to be troubled by one showing that the price of processed food has decreased in almost exact proportion to the rise in cost of fresh fruits and vegetables.\"A Place at the Table\" presents a shameful truth that should leave viewers dismayed and angry: This nation has more than enough food for all its people, yet millions of them are hungry.One thing is clear from \"A Place at the Table\": You cannot answer the question \"Why are people hungry?,\" without also asking \"Why are people poor?\"It specifically addresses our country\\'s hunger crisis. But it also speaks to larger hungers. Hungers for independence, a dignified life, a better chance for ones children-in short, the American dream. See it and weep.As rich as we are as a nation - still - many of our citizens are, at best, malnourished. One in six says they regularly don\\'t have enough to eat.It deserves to be seen, along with \"Food, Inc.,\" \"King Corn\" and other muckraking food docs of recent years.A Place at the Table is advocacy journalism at its best, lining up its facts, illustrating the widespread problem with a few trenchant and compelling cases, and offering solutions.The filmmakers vividly illustrate the power and depth of the long-spiraling problem of \"food insecurity\" by immersing us in the hardscrabble lives of a cross section of our nation\\'s poor.Revealing little that a moderately informed viewer will not already know, the film shies away from the outrage and bare-knuckle journalism that this shameful topic deserves.In addition to the dismaying facts and figures is a fuller sense of what hunger can look like, and feel like, among the millions of Americans classified as \"food-insecure\" ...So many of the words spoken in Kristi Jacobson and Lori Silverbush\\'s moving documentary about hunger in the U.S., \"A Place at the Table,\" will haunt you long after the film is over.Tthe strongest point made by the film is that hunger is a problem endemic to our social system, and it\\'s a problem that will not be served up in a soup line, one meal at a time.As important and eye-opening a documentary as you\\'ll see this year, \"A Place at the Table\" makes it impossible to think of hunger as merely another symptom of a shredded social safety net.A tighter focus, or even just a voiceover narration, might have helped.Their stories are wrenching and provide a functional framework for the directors to make some important points about hunger in America.A graceless info-dump bracketed by interviews with activists and a handful of personal stories from suffering families around the country. Like the city, Koch comes across here as brash, contradictory, almost endlessly fascinating and a bit sad.Barsky wisely includes just enough dissenting voices and admissions of grievous error by Koch himself to prevent the pic from seeming like a 100% feel-good puff piece.Koch offers as comprehensive a picture as it can in 94 minutes of a man whose tenure merits a miniseries.He was certainly combative, and confident, and full of love for the city he governed with such gusto. Koch is a New York story for the whole world to appreciate.What he really was was one of a kind. Whether intentionally or not, \"Koch\" shows that that\\'s not necessarily a bad thing.An emphasis on Koch the character obscures his administration.Though the film, more than two years in the making, was never intended as such, it plays like the kind of eulogy Koch would have approved - neither fawning nor eviscerating but always compelling.The film advances no theories to explain his contradictions, only a thrilling, sometimes affecting account of what he did.The former mayor is an alert onscreen presence, but the film surrounding him is not always so lively.\"How\\'m I doin\\'?\" Koch famously asked anyone and everyone he passed by, rarely hanging around for the answer. In \"Koch,\" for the most part, he does all right.\"Koch\" is a treasure trove of little moments that illuminate a famously cantankerous, sharp-elbowed, showboating personality.A highlight-to-lowlight chronicle of the man\\'s three terms as mayor, and in the case of any other mayor, such a narrow focus might have seemed reductive.Even if he stomped on your special interest you can\\'t deny that he did it with a sui generis verve that mixed region-specific curmudgeon-ism and impish joie de vivreI wish other questions had been asked, and pushed, and a lot more context provided.Koch presents an uncommonly juicy subject for a documentary, and filmmaker Neil Barsky makes the most of the opportunity.If the film were even two minutes longer, it might constitute Koch overload. Luckily, Barsky knows when enough is enough, even if his subject doesn\\'t.It\\'s hard to fault a documentary for being as slanted toward a subject as director Neil Barsky\\'s \"Koch\" is when the movie chronicles as self-celebratory a figure as former Mayor Ed Koch.New York may be a safer, cleaner and less argumentative place than it was in the 1980s, but he remains as contentious, as mischievous and at times as inflammatory as ever.Koch doesn\\'t try to do anything radical as a piece of filmmaking, but Barsky -- a former newspaper reporter -- covers Koch\\'s story magnificently as a journalist.Neil Barsky is aware of how a great and terribly troubling person can reside in the same body, but his occasional eagerness to appoint himself as his subject\\'s latest press agent is dubious. Photojournalist Shaul Schwarz\\'s powerful documentary Narco Cultura gets inside the world of two men who, in very different ways, inhabit this horror.It\\'s impossible to watch Shaul Schwarz\\'s grueling documentary about the Mexican drug wars and their influence on the whole of Mexican society without wondering how on earth such a hell on earth could have erupted right in our back yard.This issue-based journalism piece yields diminishing returns the deeper it digs.An eye-opening examination of Mexico\\'s blood-soaked drug war and its unsettling pop-culture side effects, Narco Cultura is as overwhelming as it is absorbing.This haunting documentary contrasts songs saluting Mexican drug lords as heroic bandits with the harrowing reality of life in murder-stained Juarez.This dispassionate but devastating film looks at the drug wars from two very different but chillingly complementary perspectives.After watching \"Narco Cultura,\" it\\'s hard to imagine any \"recreational\" user of pot wondering whether the joint he or she just smoked isn\\'t soaked in human blood.\"Narco Cultura\" aims to tell the story of what\\'s happened in Juarez and in Mexico (and, by virtue of its immense appetite for drugs, the U.S.). Instead, it feels more like a couple of intriguing chapters.The Mexican drug wars have claimed approximately 60,000 lives in the last six years. You can purchase the soundtrack on iTunes.\"Narco Cultura\" shows us two nations locked in an expensive and destructive war whose only winners are the politicians, police chiefs and drug lords, and whose losers lie in marble tombs and paupers\\' graves all over Mexico.The people in this documentary are beautiful, funny, flawed, desperate, intelligent, deluded... In other words, it never forgets that these are questions for all of us.There is nothing here that hasn\\'t been more thoroughly documented in other studies of the drug-related crime that grips Ju?√≠rez.\"I think we can be the next hip hop,\" boasts a narcocorrido impresario, who\\'s surely kidding himself.South of the border, the constant terror of bloody battles over drugs and territory has influenced music, movies and a level of star worship. But the glimpses we get here are a bit listless.Narco Cultura shows in fascinating detail how these merciless killers who have taken over the city have become Robin Hood-style folk heroes.Both an unflinching record of Mexico\\'s drug war and an investigation of how violence becomes unreal and glamorized.A potent encapsulation of how fame and finance beget fear and grief.The impression left by Narco Cultura, a brave and despairing documentary, is much grimmer still: This is a war the cartels have already decisively won, but it just keeps on escalating.Ping-ponging between grisly South of the Border carnage and Angeleno musician Edgar Quintero\\'s growing success as one of the subgenre\\'s stars, you start to see how this parasitic relationship works.The breadth of director Shaul Schwarz\\'s documentary Narco Cultura is staggering. \"Happy People\" seems to strain toward the notion that harsh nature makes for a pure heart. And perhaps it does for some. But all?Titling a documentary about snowbound Siberian fur trappers \"Happy People\" is not as ironic as it seems.It\\'s not that Happy People is uninteresting... It\\'s just that the one sensibility of which we were previously aware -- that of Herzog\\'s -- is indiscernible, as if frozen beneath all this movie\\'s ice.Herzog\\'s longing for the ideological purity in which these lives are lived, free of paperwork and bureaucracy, taxes and technology, drives the film, which lacks an overall story arc.Unmistakably part of the director\\'s canon, and just as unmistakably a minor addition to it.It\\'s a minor film from a major director but it\\'s still a strong one for those interested in its subject matter - how people can still co-exist with and live off the land instead of ignoring or abusing it.It\\'s a do-it-yourself world that Herzog clearly admires - much of what we see is the men performing the tasks that enable them to survive.They decidedly don\\'t seem happy. And \"Happy People\\'s\" decision to skate down the frozen Yenisei without examining their unhappiness more closely leaves a slight chill.Albeit a found film of sorts, Happy People is very much of a piece with Herzog\\'s other work, examining man\\'s place in the natural world, looking at man\\'s history and man\\'s ability to survive, to endure.Herzog has become a master of the understatement - knowing just how long the images can sustain you without a word being said.Herzog is not insincere. His passion for outsize experience has always captured our essential human identity against big backdrops. He captures it again in \"Happy People,\" but this time with a twist.The film has a relaxed, matter-of-fact feel.It\\'s Herzog\\'s inventive use of voice-over that elevates the film above an extremely well-researched episode of Nature.We should be grateful to Herzog for bringing us this remarkable footage, but the real subject of \"Happy People\" may be his yearning for an imaginary paradise he can\\'t have.The film is both elegiac and amazingly retro, like the nature specials that baby boomers were weaned on - although it\\'s not for animal lovers, unless you have a specific grudge against sables.Mr. Herzog is openly inspired, as ever, by the rugged independence of these resourceful trappers, who seem stoic about everything but their faithful dogs.What Herzog gleans from Yaskyuov\\'s exhaustive material is a simple observation: The men of the Taiga are heroes of rugged individualism.An inspired 94-minute rumination on the hardships and liberties of a remote culture.There is indeed much beauty on display, from the icy Taiga landscape to the age-old trapping techniques passed on through generations.Vasyukov and Herzog are united in their fascination with the particulars of how to thrive in some of the harshest conditions on Earth. The Ali of this documentary entered the ring a phenom first, but came-of-age outside of it and grew into a man, second.For kids who need an Ali primer, the terrific \"Trials\" is required watching.As with the best stories, \"The Trials of Muhammad Ali\" puts one man\\'s story within a greater context. This is Ali\\'s story, but it\\'s America\\'s story, too. Here, it\\'s well told.The Trials of Muhammad Ali allows us a chance to see Muhammad Ali not as an icon but as a man willing to take a stand, even an unpopular one, for something that he believed in.Conventional yet fascinating.Ali\\'s life has been recounted so many times that you\\'d think no one could come up with a fresh angle on it; documentary maker Bill Siegel succeeds, primarily by delving into the religious story, largely downplayed by the mainstream.With athletes in 2013 giving in to everything around them, Ali\\'s strength feels even more palpable. He truly was the greatest.If you have fond memories of David Susskind\\'s talk shows from the golden age of 1960s television, prepare to have them blasted away by this revealing documentary.There is history as it\\'s remembered, and then there\\'s history as it happened. This documentary gives us the latter, and it\\'s a true education.The archival footage in Bill Siegel\\'s documentary \"The Trials of Muhammad Ali\" is wondrous. How could it not be, featuring the gentleman in the title.It effectively recalls what a divisive, often irritating, even hated figure Ali was back in the day, before his ascent to the realm of myth and near-sainthood.The film deploys the usual nonfiction arsenal of news footage, archival photographs, and interviews to bring home the strange electricity of these seven or so years.The documentary The Trials of Muhammad Ali is an extraordinarily detailed and textured examination of the man, the time, and the societal forces involved.Balanced. It shows us just enough of Ali in his prime so that we understand how much he lost when he refused to serve in Vietnam.An intriguing portrait of a man who never wavered no matter what the world threw at him. Which was a lot.The heavyweight champ\\'s controversial political views are reexamined in this stirring, fascinating documentary.The Trials of Muhammad Ali, Bill Siegel\\'s fascinating documentary about the legendary boxer, cares less about how he handled himself in the ring than how he handled himself in life.The saga of Ali\\'s refusal to be drafted during Vietnam becomes a profile in courage -- a tale of shocking vilification and faith lost and found.An invigorating doc brings the long-forgotten controversy to life.Ali\\'s greatest fight, covered in this film as it never has been before, was to be accepted as himself, not as anyone\\'s symbol. No film in the festival is as critic-friendly; watching it, I finally understood how football players must feel about \\'Brian\\'s Song\\'.This is a sometimes painful but always inspiring tribute to one of the great members of our profession.Movies help us think about who we are and how we live together. And as a movie, Life Itself is a heartfelt, clear-eyed tribute to a master.With Ebert\\'s blessing and encouragement, Life Itself is a warts-and-all look at how the son of an Illinois electrician and housewife became a prolific writer who spent 46 years as the film critic at the Chicago Sun Times.What comes through most in Life Itself, a film named after Ebert\\'s 2011 memoir, is his great, open-minded vigor.If you aren\\'t moved by Life Itself, you ought to have your heart examined.The film\\'s core is footage shot during the last four months of Ebert\\'s life, when he had lost most of his jaw and was unable to eat or speak. It\\'s hard to see him in this state, which makes his frequent cheerfulness and humor all the more remarkable.It\\'s undercooked (we\\'re not even told what movies he loved as a child) and a clip of the great New Yorker critic Pauline Kael speaking made me sit bolt upright thinking \"Now you\\'re talking.\"Taking its title from Ebert\\'s bestselling memoir, this lovely, insightful film is a splendidly watchable tribute to a truly cinematic life.With the man\\'s passing, American film lost not just an inimitable figure but a voice that was as forceful and distinctive as it was ubiquitous.A film about a movie critic might not sound an attractive proposition, but Steve James\\'s biographical documentary on Pulitzer Prize-winning, Chicago Sun-Times journalist Roger Ebert (who died last year) is deeply moving.Fans of the great populist film critic Roger Ebert will be both moved and amused by Life Itself.Steve James\\'s cinematic take on Roger Ebert\\'s autobiography stands as a warm tribute to America\\'s most prominent mainstream movie critic.[A] warm, well structured and affecting tribute as someone who lived a full life and refused to be afraid of dying.James puts Ebert\\'s criticism carefully in context, and isn\\'t guilty of either overstating his influence or whitewashing the less genial aspects of the man.It\\'s an inspiring documentary for critics, and anyone who loves cinema.The strongest parts of the movie are those that deal with the sometimes radioactive relationship between Siskel and Ebert.A very worthy delve into a eventful life cut short by cancer.A clear-eyed celebration of a giant of film writing. We\\'ll refrain from the thumb jokes, but consider this a hearty recommendation.No less than James\\'s capital punishment documentary At the Death House Door, this asks us to think long and hard about what it means to die with dignity. Pavich makes great use of the legendary and massive Dune flipbook Jodorowsky touted around Hollywood in the mid-\\'70s.Pavich shows us many images from the storyboard, and even treats some to a simple form of animation to suggest how the movie might have looked.The phantom film is, by its nature, always rich with possibilities.Frank Pavich\\'s new documentary on the obsessive Chilean surrealist\\'s projected epic masterwork is very nearly as marvelous as \"Jodo\"\\'s adaptation of Frank Herbert\\'s novel might have been.This documentary version of Jodorowsky\\'s \"Dune\" is probably more entertaining than what Hollywood would have done to it, with a clearer message: Our lives are like sands though an hourglass, so dream the impossible dream.A deeply moving testament to single-minded, indefatigable commitment of creative vision and to an almost spiritual ability to let that vision go, thereby allowing it to exist in the world in an entirely unexpected form.Jodorowsky is a mesmerizing presence in director Frank Pavich\\'s engrossing picture. He was 84 when much of it was shot.Jodorowsky\\'s Dune gives you a good sense of what might have been, and judging by what we see, the picture might have accomplished what the director ultimately intended: \"To mutate young minds.\"What an extraordinary dream it could have been.It leaves you wondering about how many artists are working on such wild dreams these days, and hoping it\\'s more than you think.It\\'s an outstanding combination of genius and missed opportunities.The best way to watch this movie is as an account of an eccentric visionary maverick who could not be stopped or influenced by reason ...We get an idea of what could have been via the colossal illustrated screenplay still lovingly held by Jodorowsky, who is every bit the dreamer in his 80s that he was in his youth.Is Alejandro Jodorowsky\\'s \"Dune\" the most influential movie never made?Frank Savich\\'s diverting documentary lets the 85-year-old filmmaker revisit a saga from the mid-\\'70s: his stellar two-year failure to adapt Frank Herbert\\'s Dune for the screen.A great seminar on creativity.His stories feature an impressive roster of would-be collaborators (Salvador Dali, Orson Welles, H.R. Geiger, and Pink Floyd), and some of the set pieces he describes sound pretty neat.Pavich\\'s movie is more profound as a tribute to the imagination of visionary directors who can\\'t realize their visions.\"Jodorowsky\\'s Dune\" is a lovely little tribute to a major league \"What if?\"The best parts of Jodorowsky\\'s Dune explain just how a mad genius like Jodorowsky almost made the impossible possible, just by declaring it to be so. Panh fulfills his debts to the dead not just by adding to the visual record of genocide, but also by creating a transcendent work of art.These battered, scratched pieces of film are eloquent testimony for the terrible offences that happened.Rithy Panh\\'s cinema is an exemplary case of the imperative to bear witness.Many films have examined from many vantages the Khmer Rouge\\'s nightmare reign, notably Roland Joff\\'s 1985 Oscar winner The Killing Fields.As haunting as it is haunted, \"The Missing Picture\" leaves viewers\\' heads rattling with ghosts.A uniquely subjective account of the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s, \"The Missing Picture\" is the work of Rithy Panh, a Cambodian native who left his homeland when he was an adolescent.[It] aspires to a poetry about barbarism that will not let us forget.What remains disturbing and puzzling is the realisation that somewhere along the line the real and the false change places, and that Panh is able to move us more deeply with his dioramas than by telling the same atrocious story in a straightforward way.The film captures how Pol Pot took Mao\\'s Great Leap Forward to new levels of Marxist madness.Panh uses the props and eerie clips from Khmer Rouge propaganda newsreels to tell about his family, and his country. Along with starkly poetic narration, read by Randal Douc, the effect is devastating, without a single scene of actual bloodshed.These miniatures magnify their subjects, and ennoble them. The picture is anguishing to see, but it isn\\'t missing anymore.Panh believes that those who survive such oppression are obligated to speak about it - and this chronicle is impossible not to watch.A survivor\\'s story,a political statement and an eloquent meditation on images and memory. The miniatures and the film are exquisite works of art infused with living memoryThis is a first-person account of astonishing suffering, yet the experience of watching \"The Missing Picture\" is not punishing.Panh blends documentary, personal memoir and eccentric artistic experiment ...As an examination of memory and experience and how they shape us, \"The Missing Picture\" is meaningful beyond its specific subject matter.The audacity of \"The Missing Picture\" - a brilliant documentary about a child who held on to life in Cambodia\\'s killing fields - is equaled only by its soulfulness.The Missing Picture is so immediate, so vital, it practically breathes. Not all memoirs need to exist. But the gentle urgency of Panh\\'s story is right there in the filmmaking.The conceit is tremendously daring, but one with a huge payoff, suggesting an evil that can\\'t be fully processed by young eyes.The Missing Picture isn\\'t a straightforward piece of storytelling, but more of a meditation on what happened [...] whenever the narration threatens to drift off into the ether, the figurines and models ultimately keep it on terra firma. Laura Poitras\\'s Oscar-nominated documentary Citizenfour is proof that you can make an espionage thriller without car chases, bikini babes or martinis.There\\'s footage from within the Ecuadorian embassy in London as Julian Assange helps with the flight that takes Snowden to Moscow, where he claims political asylum. These scenes give the film an unprecedented level of immediacy and dramatic tension.Poitras\\' movie works even better as a horror picture -- perfect for Halloween week.This thoughtful film is designed with taste.The message of the movie is as clear as Siberian ice: Whether you\\'re a Tea Partier, an Occupier or just an ordinary Joe, you might be the next citizen who\\'s stranded in limbo.The scariest thing you\\'ll see this Halloween is Edward Snowden swearing in disbelief at the end of Laura Poitras\\' gripping, disturbing documentary.Filmmaker Laura Poitras paints a frankly terrifying picture of the loss of liberty involved in the widespread government gathering of the communication done by ordinary Joes on a daily basis.Without too much knowledge or preconceived ideas, it would make me an easy mark for a polemic about modern privacy -- but Poitras\\'s bracing, galvanizing new documentary about the Snowden affair isn\\'t that at all.Citizenfour argues that when we lose our personal privacy, we also lose our liberty, because fear overcomes our freedom of speech.Citizenfour plays like a thriller as it chronicles a complex and vitally important chapter in our history.The documentary of the year may also be its most hair-raising thriller.So explosive, it\\'s one of the most riveting films you\\'ll see this year.Citizenfour is obviously in Snowden\\'s corner, but as an example of pure cinema vrit, this is the finest - and most disturbing - political documentary since Alex Gibney\\'s Oscar-winning Taxi to the Dark Side.This isn\\'t just a documentary -- this is history.Far from just trading in conjecture and abstraction, Citizenfour self-reflexively dramatises the dangers that Snowden wants to warn us about.Documentarian Laura Poitras has crafted a first-rate Hitchcockian-type thriller telling the story of Edward Snowden.Shares more DNA with such 1970s classics as The Parallax View, The Conversation or All the President\\'s Men, than it does with most documentaries.This is a complicated story, but it\\'s efficiently laid out by Poitras in this smartly edited project.If you think Snowden is a traitor, you should probably see it. If you think he\\'s a hero, you should probably see it. If you haven\\'t made up your mind - well, you get the idea.Alarming in the best sense of the word. There\\'s something indomitable about her will to perform, and insecurity has been part of her experience for decades, it\\'s clear.Chiemi Karasawa deserves all the credit in the world for the intimate and hilarious portrait that is Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me, a sparkling cocktail of music and memoir. On the other hand, she didn\\'t exactly have to drag her subject out of her shell.[A] feisty portrait of the musical-theater legend.\"Elaine Stritch\" is filled with bluster and memories, blunt outbursts and funny moments. But more importantly, it is filled with honesty.Elaine Stritch\\'s strength, along with the film\\'s, comes from her honesty. She is herself, even when - maybe especially when - she knows she\\'s being watched.Really, the experience of \"Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me\" is the experience of being in Stritch\\'s company for 80 minutes, and that\\'s fine. Still I doubt anyone will walk out of this film wishing it were 10 minutes longer.By the end, even those who had never heard of Stritch can share her rage against the dying of the light.An enjoyably fawning documentary.This is a must-see for anyone who loves theater, acting and especially individuals like Elaine Stritch unafraid to bare their souls -- so all of us can gain more insight into the complicated essence of the human condition.Stritch, in her trademark billowy white blouses and skinny black tights, or in bed, without makeup and without, sometimes, a lucid notion, reveals herself to be full of opposing emotions and desires.This profile of stage and screen veteran Elaine Stritch, shot during her 87th year, isn\\'t a documentary so much as an improvised star vehicle; she plays to the camera through the entire movie and puts on a hell of a show.You watch \"Shoot Me\" wishing this woman could keep sashaying through her showbiz life forever ...The movie\\'s a portrait of tough yet vulnerable woman fighting age with everything she\\'s got, giving in, getting scared, fighting some more.Formidable, indomitable, irascible: Pick your adjective, and it pretty much describes the force of nature who holds the stage in \"Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me.\"\"I Feel Pretty,\" from \"West Side Story,\" was written for an ingenue, not a grande dame in her ninth decade, but she sings it with delicious irony, self-irony and irrepressible delight.I suppose it helps to have seen Stritch onstage to fully appreciate the bracing new documentary \"Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me,\" released by Sundance Selects. I wish I\\'d seen more.She is more than a little abrasive in the finished documentary, yet she is also compulsively watchable. No wonder she\\'s a star.One of those showbiz docs that\\'s not exactly pleasurable but offers a penetrating glimpse - sometimes too penetrating - into what it means to eat, drink, and be contrary in the public sphere.Inspirational, entertaining, and absolutely awards-caliber...Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me offers up an indelible and rare experience in cinematic form-it\\'s simply an absolute treat to be able to spend this much intimate time with such a legendary lady.Follows the groundwork laid out by the recent Joan Rivers: A Piece of Work, alternating between look-where-she\\'s-been historical footage and look-at-her-go glimpses of her current busy schedule. An existentially probing documentary with more layers than a twisty Hollywood thriller, at turns inspiring, challenging, sobering and finally devastating.It develops into a study of obsession, hypocrisy, righteousness and self-doubt, questioning motive and then gob-smacking the audience with the wholly unexpected.While initially a gentle interrogation of Christian dogma, The Overnighters expands to a larger investigation of altruism and its roots in private psychologies.Moss lets his characters and their stories unfold, crafting a film from them intuitively through the right interview questions and the art of editing, but never placing a narrative on it that feels forced.Full of ambush, surprise, illumination, it\\'s a total corker. And Moss and his camera, somehow, are there every time a new bottle of truth is opened, with a gush, a pop or an explosion.Moss uses images of drill towers or blistering flame as visual metaphors for other things transpiring on screen: the fracturing of a family, the heated fury that comes with a sense of betrayal.\"The Overnighters\" is commendable for many reasons, not the least of which is the way it allows complex issues to remain complex. There is a clear conflict between the pastor and the town, but there\\'s no good vs. evil.So much of \"The Overnighters\" tells all sorts of truths, and Moss earned the trust of his subjects, whatever they might think of the result.The movie might seem like just another liberal do-gooder profile, yet a shocker ending throws new and disturbing light on the situation, amplifying the Christian themes at the heart of the story.A sobering must-see, The Overnighters speaks to the eternal dilemma of doing the right thing in a community beset by suspicion and fear.Through patience, skill, discretion, and trust, Jesse Moss has taken a seemingly small town story and turned it into both a microcosm of today\\'s most urgent issues and a portrait of a single suffering soul.Acute portraiture - and for a sobering depiction of an America in crisis that looks shockingly close to the desperation of the 1930s.A classic example of a documentary that discovers its subject in the process of its making.Moss has put the documentary together in painstaking fashion, somehow managing to be there, filming discreetly, at all the most intimate and climactic moments.It\\'s one of those Steinbeck-style stories of migrants, poverty, desperation and hope, a heartbreaking picture of men who still believe they are living the American Dream in broken-down trailers doing grim, unhealthy jobs.It\\'s the rare documentary in which truly unpredictable events unfold and no assumption is safe.Jesse Moss\\'s tough, absorbing documentary could almost be a modern-day Grapes of Wrath, all about the US oil industry\\'s fracking boom in North Dakota.Demands a rewatch, and is so stuffed with incident that someone should remake it into an overcooked, Americana melodrama.An urgent portrait of compassion under fire.Long before this unexpected development, The Overnighters has established its credentials as a beautifully crafted, multi-layered piece of storytelling, and as an important snapshot of the new Great Depression. [A] moving, observant documentary about the relationship between the ailing 93-year-old legend and master trumpeter Clark Terry and Justin Kauflin, a blind pianist Terry successfully mentored.Terry\\'s enveloping warmth, wisdom and good nature give the Oscar-shortlisted documentary much of its energy.\"Keep on Keepin\\' On\" might document the passing of a musical torch from one century to the next, but for one sticking point: The first torch plain refuses to go out.What really makes Keep On Keepin\\' On such a heart-tugging, three-handkerchief crowd pleaser is that at heart, it\\'s a buddy movie.Terry produced some of the happiest sounds in the history of jazz; Keep on Keepin\\' On keeps the smiles coming.As joyful as a jumping jazz riff, Keep on Keepin\\' On is an inspiring story of devotion, dedication and multi-generational friendship.Steadily a portrait emerges of a man who is an inspiration as much for his character as for his talent.A celebration of music, perseverance and human connection, \"Keep on Keepin\\' On\" is for both jazz lovers and lovers of life.One need not be a jazz aficionado to enjoy this film. All that\\'s required is a smile.If the film introduces more people to Terry\\'s music, it will have more than served its purpose.Like too many films on athletes and artists, Keep on Keepin\\' On seems afraid of going over our heads by examining the technique of its two musicians.As Terry\\'s health declines, the documentary takes on a rather ghoulish aspect; at one point both his legs have to be amputated, and Jones, himself pushing 80, shows up for an emotional reunion that one assumes will be the men\\'s last.The stories unfold in parallel, occasionally intertwining, and as one narrative examines a glorious past, the other focuses on an uncertain future.Slowly, the powerful message of heart and soul winning out over an impaired body and over-thinking mind develops into the core drama of this otherwise modest doc.Terry seems happy just about all the time.It\\'s genuinely nice to see a man of Terry\\'s stature put his faith in an artist of a younger generation, their bond strengthened by a shared love of music.Alan Hicks\\'s affectionate and moving look at the relationship between the great trumpeter Clark Terry and Justin Kauflin, a talented young pianist.The movie hits a beautiful, celebratory note.Quietly stirring ...Seeing a living legend laid up in an oxygen tent shouldn\\'t be fun. But in Alan Hicks\\'s doc Keep On Keepin\\' On, it somehow is. Time Is Illmatic is well-informed but inessential, a making-of featurette barely expanded to feature length at a trim 74 minutes.Just as \"Illmatic\" brought people from all across the globe a little closer to Queensbridge, Nas: Time is Illmatic draws audiences closer to hip-hop.An essential celebration of the New York rapper\\'s groundbreaking 1994 album.A strikingly photographed and genuinely revealing exploration of the early influences that formed one of the most distinctive voices in rap.Flirts with glamorising the rags-to-rap-to-riches story, but in doing so stays true to its subject.Here\\'s 74 minutes well spent.A well-made and well-shot companion piece to the album, telling the story of Nas\\' early life and the circumstances that led to his birth as a hip-hop legend.Time Is Illmatic does a terrific job of weaving hip-hop history into a highly personal story.The movie is inspiring and tragic, and, directed by street artist One9, it\\'s captured in an artful, emotional way that will speak to an audience beyond rap fans.As both an origin story about a great artist and a distillation of \\'80s urban blight, it\\'s as breathless and real as any street-corner rhyme.The album lives as a touchstone, and a turning point, in New York hip hop. The film may be far less significant, but it does bear witness to the music\\'s greatness.Since many of the themes from \"Illmatic\" have become mere clichs in contemporary rap, this film serves as a reminder of the potential and the promise that hip-hop truly holds.The camera roams the way the human eye would, yet it knows the power of stillness, of letting the image linger and rest. These documentarians masterfully construct their vision to elevate and serve their subject.Nothing seems to get short shrift, including Nas\\' parentage, childhood, education, and musical beginnings. Yet, at a brisk 75 minutes, the film doesn\\'t overstay its welcome.Despite some conventional moves here and there and a weakness for the cult of genius, the documentary sustains that uneasy mood cast by Nas\\'s expression as a child on the \"Illmatic\" cover, sobered by experience and wisdom before his time.The portrait misses out on discussing cultural impact, but the trade-off is a full-bodied tale of bootstrapping, sure to turn on any budding artist in the audience.The film understands that the most interesting thing about Nas is how he once converted 20 years of living into 40 minutes of art that transcends its genre, its era, even its medium.While the trivia value may feel tremendous, only One9\\'s interviews with Nas, his father, Olu Dara, and his brother, Jungle, manage to make the doc legitimately moving--a history lesson in popular culture.[A] brisk, stylish and extremely heartfelt portrait of Nas\\' rise from the housing projects of Queensbridge to the heights of hip-hop royalty.It aims small and never veers off-task. Whether or not you dig the album, the documentary offers a number of reasons to appreciate its ongoing legacy, with sufficient production values to hold the tribute together. Finding Vivian Maier never does not reveal much about the inner life of the woman at the center of the story, but it does a solid job of its more important mission: bringing Maier\\'s rarely seen work to light.This is a film that starts out being about an unknown artist and ends up being about something more complex and challenging: a person.Maier\\'s life tells us one thing: great photographers always show themselves in their work, even if they never show their work.A fascinating story which continues to raise more questions than it answers.Finding Vivian Maier is a tantalising and utterly fascinating film but one which can\\'t ever quite explain the mystery of Maier.Finding Vivian Maier is not without its frustrations. And that, we suspect, is exactly what she would have wanted.Finding Vivian Maier is one of those fascinating documentaries that unearths an unknown artist and in a slow reveal creates a tantalising and ambiguous picture of the \"missing\" person.Although Ms Maier (or Ms Mayer, or Ms Meyer, or even Ms Smith, depending on what name she was using at the time) remains an enigma, there is still plenty in this film to keep you planted in your seat.This is a fascinating study.An intriguing look at a lost voice.Downbeat and inconclusive, but likeable all the same.The life intrigues; the art endures.Nothing, and no one, makes a better case for the unveiling of Maier\\'s work than her pictures themselves.Every time one of her photos flashes on the screen, the woman\\'s genius is undeniable.A portrait of an American artist hiding in plain sight, a mystery with too few clues, and a sincere inquiry into how best to divine the wishes of the dead.A film that leaves a large part of its subject\\'s mystery gratifyingly intact.The holes in the story are papered over with such beautiful photographs that few viewers could complain.This is an amazing tale, and Maloof has labored mightily to flesh it out. He\\'s almost as odd as Maier was.Through dogged research and interviews with the (now-grown) children Maier cared for, along with their parents (including Phil Donahue), a profile emerges, and it\\'s fascinating.Finding Vivian Maier is a find in more ways than one. Hypnotic and serene.If only the viewing environment were more suited to casual contemplation, allowing the audience (like the passengers) to dip in and out of the car in 10-minute stretches.Manakamana works as a tone poem, a Warholian revel in the mundane and an ethnographic study of an isolated corner.Though its subject matter doesn\\'t seem particularly fun on the surface, Stephanie Spray and Pacho Velez\\'s Manakamana is a sort of structural game, by turns contemplative and, yes, playful.Boring? Absolutely not. Strangely revealing, meditative and funny? Yes, as passengers reveal themselves by costume, silence, chatter and posture, rising up through a hazy, green landscape into the clouds where Manakamana.We\\'re basically gawking at a commute.Multiple viewings simply allow for more diverse and creative readings of the material.Invited to sit in the facing seat, we have long minutes to watch, listen and assess, considering who these pilgrims are and what, aside from worship, has really brought them here.\"Manakamana\" is simple in conception, but the reactions it evokes in viewers will be complex and multifaceted.\"Manakamana\" is a haunting experience, one that requires patience (and then some) but that offers spiritual, philosophical, and aesthetic rewards beyond the immediate power of words to describe.Manakamana is a travel film that\\'s not about the ride, but the riders. Ourselves included, of course.The directors, Pacho Velez (who did the camera work) and Stephanie Spray (who recorded the sound), condense world history into the confined space of a glassed-in bubble.By focusing on such a narrow slice of Nepali life, Ms. Spray and Mr. Velez have ceded any totalizing claim on the truth and instead settled for a perfect incompleteness.Manakamana doesn\\'t answer any questions, yet makes its point: Nepal, like the rest of our planet, is a picturesque but far from peaceable kingdom.As a theatrical experience, Manakamana is spellbinding. But it\\'s a complex spell ...I\\'ve never seen anything like it.You could hardly ask for a more beautiful vision of souls in transit.Manakamana is both calming and imagination-sparking, forcing viewers to look at human faces for 10-minute stretches, whether those faces are talking excitedly or quietly looking around.Filmmakers Stephanie Spray and Pacho Velez insist that altered spectatorship, particularly patience and duration, is the foundation of cinematic edification.If \"Leviathan\" showed us the primal terror of everyday life, this new film is a warm hug, a salute to our shared humanity. Particle Fever shows how the theorists and experimenters need and respect each other, in the course of setbacks, disappointments, premature celebrations and public relations glitches.Particle Fever explores with awe-inspiring precision, and in remarkably accessible language, how 10,000 scientists and engineers from around the world built what in effect is the ultimate test tube for particle physics.The enthusiasm, idealism, and cheerful brilliance of the six subjects convey the thrill, if not the full significance, of this scientific breakthrough.It plays out with all the suspense of a thriller.Even the most math-averse viewer will be on pins and needs to know the results.The filmmakers find room for some witty philosophical bull sessions and affectionate portraits of some of the physicists; this is an agreeable light entertainment on a complex subject.Even if you can\\'t explain the Standard Model or define \"supersymmetry,\" you\\'ll walk away with a conviction that you\\'ve vicariously participated in a historic event.The bracing scientific rigor and intellectual derring-do presented in \"Particle Fever\" are most welcome.All you really need to know about Particle Fever is that it includes footage of physicists rapping. About physics. Wearing giant Einstein masks.The film allows for our awe. It also demonstrates that science is the most human of activities, with all that that implies.Set in crummy offices and towering facilities worthy of a Bond movie, the documentary is edited with the momentum of a thriller by the great Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now), as we follow six scientists.Watching a film won\\'t make you smarter, but if there ever was one that could, it would be \"Particle Fever,\" a movie so mind-bending you can almost feel your brain cells growing as you\\'re watching it.As fictional Vulcan Spock might have pronounced: \"Fascinating.\"Talk about a smash hit.A compelling, if sometimes difficult to follow, story.The film may not put itself above the uninitiated, but director Mark Levinson oftentimes appears almost too eager to present his material with affectation.A movie that\\'s not just accessible but fun, with a surprisingly emotional payoff at the end.Particle Fever is that rare, exhilarating science doc that\\'s neither dumbed down nor drabbed up.The experience of watching the film can be vertiginous: You toggle between the tiny and the infinite, between eternity and the real time of the recent past.A dazzling, dizzying documentary about nothing less than whether we exist in a coherent universe of ordered, even beautiful laws ... The best one can say for this troubling, if intermittently fascinating, mess is that it succeeds in raising questions, moral as well as aesthetic, that it cannot answer.Each viewer will judge its truth for themselves, but the director\\'s compassionately unsentimental acceptance is clear and profound.This is a complex and very moving documentary.The Last of the Unjust is cinema at its very best.Haunted and haunting.The 89 year-old director has lost none of his bold inquisitiveness in a Shoah follow-up that plunges the viewer deep into the hustle and anguish of the Czech ghetto.A historical restoration for a modern day reckoning.Watching the film is like entering a labyrinth, following a winding thread of story that seems unlikely ever to come to an end.Murmelstein addresses Lanzmann\\'s skepticism and questions with earnestness, passion and -- as if the rest of it wasn\\'t troubling enough -- what seems like total recall.Lanzmann organizes the material achronologically, presenting Murmelstein\\'s narrative out of order and intercutting it with footage of Theresienstadt shot in 2012; this complex structure evokes a sense of moral vertigo that\\'s nearly impossible to shake.Those who think this is a black-and-white issue will be surprised, as Lanzmann himself appears to have been, by what is said here.[Lanzmann is] the kind of witness the Holocaust needs: The witness who refuses to leave the stand until the full story is told.The new film may not qualify for masterpiece status, but it\\'s an enthralling portrait of a man-an exceptionally brilliant and articulate man-who personified the courage, complexity and moral ambiguity of his tortured time.Murmelstein deserves his own movie and now, more than 20 years after his death, he gets it.A startling double portrait of the will to endure.A powerful reflection on the beginning of Hitler\\'s Final Solution is seen through the intelligent, sardonic eyes of an aged eyewitness.Another demanding and deeply rewarding investigation into the Holocaust from documentarian Claude Lanzmann.[Lanzmann\\'s] documentary doesn\\'t deserve an audience so much as demand one.My hunch is that most viewers, whatever their previous views on this fraught subject, will come away not only fascinated but largely convinced by Murmelstein, who comes across as extremely intelligent, self-aware, sincere and honest ...It is a fascinating story, and although one told before - the 2003 documentary \"Prisoner of Paradise\" also touched on this \"model\" ghetto - Murmelstein has a wealth of detail at his fingers, particularly the vicious lies the Nazis themselves told. Some of the film\\'s most fascinating moments pay tribute to the gallery\\'s technical prowess and craftsmanship.Wiseman\\'s fly-on-the-wall style is the perfect formal approach to cut through the surface of pretence that dominates any kind of major institution\\'s vision of itself, and it is this fascination with institutions that has marked Wiseman\\'s lengthy career.The film upholds the belief that the commonalities of self-expression, storytelling, and insightful observation reverberate through time.To say Frederick Wiseman makes observational documentaries is like saying Alfred Hitchcock made thrillers -- accurate, but not the heart of the matter.At three hours, the result is long, but perhaps less exhausting than a visit to the actual gallery, because of how thoroughly the mind is engaged even as the senses are saturated.We\\'re used to documentaries having a pedagogical or activist itinerary, but Wiseman\\'s have become fastidiously unpedantic -- his simple Terence-like interest in what other human beings do and how they do it is more than enough.The first of many pleasant surprises in National Gallery... is the unobstructed view afforded to paintings that now seem almost unrecognisable without a pair of gangly, backpacked foreign exchange students locking lips in front of them.The trick with this kind of subtle, fly-on-the-wall film-making is gradually to change our preconceptions about the subject.Frederick Wiseman\\'s fascinating and uplifting documentary takes us into the heart of London\\'s National Gallery, showing us everything from the painstaking work of frame-makers to heated boardroom meetings and even dance performances.An intriguing and valuable record.A mesmerising look at the great gallery at work.One of cinema\\'s Old Masters returns with this poetic and profound dissection of art and storytelling.Sitting there with something like National Gallery, it\\'s not the rush of time you feel. It\\'s the rush of applied skill.If a picture is worth a thousand words, then there are at least a million things worth talking about in National Gallery.The real subject of this documentary is looking at people looking: it\\'s the faces of all the people who pass through the National Gallery, some bored, some uncomprehending, others deeply moved, even transfixed.National Gallery presents the famous art space as almost a living and breathing thing, with all the complications and rough glory that implies.\"National Gallery,\" a meandering trip through the famed London art institution, has many sublime scenes - and some tedious ones, too.Though Wiseman\\'s now well into his 80s, his eye\\'s as sharp as ever.Frederick Wiseman\\'s documentary National Gallery is for art lovers, movie lovers -- basically for anybody.[An] iridescent look at London\\'s premier art institution. Authoritative and exhaustive. A must-watch.The film is rich in archival-memory and first-person recollections of many key figures, of higher and lower or no rank at all.There\\'s nothing innovative in the filmmaking, it\\'s simply a gracefully told story - tense here; poignant there - with strong detailing.[A] disarming documentary about the fall of Saigon, a movie that is as much about human decency as diplomatic incompetence.Archived film of the final, chaotic push to clear the embassy compound by helicopter is as dramatic as any thriller, heightened by stories of bravery and risk.A testament to people, as one source puts it, \"doing their best under terrible circumstances.\"This is both a gripping suspense story and a profound moral drama.Powerful and terrifying.\"Last Days in Vietnam\" will be broadcast in April on the long-running PBS series \"American Experience.\" But it holds up on a bigger screen and deserves a large audience earlier than that.A film of great sadness, but also a galvanizing depiction of heroism.There is enough triumph and tragedy and heroism and heartbreak here to fill three or four features, but director Rory Kennedy smartly packs everything into just 98 minutes, and so captures the rushed, chaotic, just-keep-going feel of those dark days.Sometimes the stories we think we know, the stories where we don\\'t want to hear another word, turn out to be the most involving of all, the ones we in fact know the least about. So it is with \"Last Days in Vietnam.\"As a portrait of America in a moment both of idealism and betrayal, the movie is heartbreaking as well as inspiring.Inspiring and thrilling.\"The Last Days in Vietnam,\" at its core, is about moral courage - the bravery to confront the question of \"who goes and who gets left behind,\" as retired Army colonel Stuart Herrington puts it.By turning her attention to an underreported chapter in recent history, Kennedy has found a trove rich with unreal imagery and stories of heroism in the face of defeat.In sum, Last Days is the best kind of doc - it ties you up in knots.As great documentaries do, \"Last Days in Vietnam\" humanizes events that can seem merely factual in news reports and textbooks.One of the things that makes Kennedy\\'s film so powerful is that it\\'s not just a story of stupidity and tragedy and incompetence, although there\\'s more than enough of those qualities to be found in the history of America\\'s Vietnamese misadventure.Perhaps the most striking thing about \"Last Days in Vietnam,\" Rory Kennedy\\'s eye-opening documentary about the 1975 evacuation of the American Embassy in Saigon, is how calmly it surveys what was once among the angriest topics in American political life. Talking (egg)heads reiterate outrage over the Obama Justice Department\\'s witch hunt against him, but Swartz\\'s ex-girlfriend adds heart when she tearfully recalls first seeing the \\'\\'end date\\'\\' on his Wikipedia page.Knappenberger argues that the case against Swartz was overzealously pursued in order to make an example of him and on the evidence presented here it\\'s hard to disagree.The film builds up a portrait of a brilliant, driven, complex young man who\\'s likely to be an iconic figure in the future, a sort of digital-age Che Guevara.The sad untimely death of precocious internet maven Aaron Schwartz is the focus of this chilling doc.Fascinating, maddening, and ultimately very sad.The film not only canonizes its hero - who committed suicide amid a nasty federal indictment against him - but also brushes aside any big-picture concerns about national security and Internet piracy.Aaron Swartz\\'s story should make you furious.Deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Documentary.A touching, morally outraged portrait that, in memory of Swartz, may inspire people to ask hard questions about how the new world is being shaped away from view, behind closed doors.Swartz might be better served by a sensitive actor\\'s portrayal in a future dramatic biopic.A moving documentary that will leave you heartsick as well as more than a little angry.A devastating meditation on what can happen when a prescient thinker challenges corporate interests and the power of the state.A documentary whose chief aims - at which it succeeds - are to mourn a fallen activist angel and rile audiences into rage.Knappenberger\\'s documentary is smart and focused, homing in on a recurring theme of independence.The bits and bytes come fast, and not always with context. Still, the loss of a man whose gifts were on the cutting edge is felt deeply.See the movie, flaws and all, simply to see where you stand in this digital river that runs through all our lives, connecting and isolating us in ways we\\'re barely able to comprehend.It\\'s a call to action in the form of an adoring profile, which is effective (and affecting) strategy, but narrow, propagandistic filmmaking.A system that tries to scare harmless do-gooders into submission does America no credit. In this case, it succeeded all too horribly well.May his death not be in vain.A movie that preaches to its rafters-raising choir. It feels visceral to watch some of the historic footage unfold.Ms. Dore\\'s work is not only a tribute to past bravery and determination, but also a warning and urgent rallying cry to the next wave.Although much of that archival footage is incredibly familiar after decades of exposure - the burning bras, the clever protest signs, the impassioned speeches, Gloria Steinem - it\\'s the footage of the opposition that really shocks.The wealth of anecdotal material provides a fascinating perspective on how the movement intersected -- and sometimes clashed -- with other liberal crusades of the 60s.It\\'s a bubbling cauldron of newfound freedom and energy coming to life, an inspiring reminder of what people of a like mind and heart can accomplish. \"She\\'s Beautiful When She\\'s Angry\" is a thing of beauty indeed.A superbly researched and edited documentary about the women\\'s movement in the 1960s.Intermittently interesting and occasionally compelling history of the feminist movement\\'s early days.Dore\\'s film should be seen. Take your daughters. And your sons.\"She\\'s Beautiful When She\\'s Angry\" doesn\\'t break much formal ground. But it serves as a moving reminder of how crucial citizen action is in fomenting social change.It\\'s a useful documentary, and it needed to be made now.A few awkward re-enactments mar the effect, but they\\'re over quickly, while the narrators\\' voices and plentiful historical footage create a rich mosaic.An exceptional chronicle, its mix of archival material and new interviews bristling with the energy and insight of one of the most important social movements of the 20th century.It\\'s rare in today\\'s era of overstuffed nonfiction films that a documentary leaves you wanting more. But that\\'s the case with Mary Dore\\'s cheekily titled She\\'s Beautiful When She\\'s Angry....the film is both cautionary and inspiring.This history might easily fill out a 12-part miniseries. It\\'s to the credit of \"She\\'s Beautiful\" that it seems neither hectic nor glib despite the enormous amounts of material that doubtless had to be excluded to fit a single feature\\'s frame.A somewhat less than successful film.[A] fascinating historical documentary.As filmmaking, \"She\\'s Beautiful\" is meat and potatoes: It gets the job done without frills.An urgent, illuminating dive into the headwaters of second-wave feminism, the movement that - no matter what its detractors insist - has given us the world in which we live.This stirring and informative documentary about the rise of the women\\'s movement in the United States, between 1966 and 1971, is an enticing blend of historical clips (most too brief) and interviews with many of the movement\\'s leaders. It\\'s an uneven affair, embraced as unguardedly \"intimate\" by some fans of the band, but in reality less moving than Anvil! The Story of Anvil, and lacking the objective insight of Terry Zwigoff\\'s oddly comparable Crumb.We loved every minute of Tom\\'s company and his film, right down to Halford\\'s O Holy Night over the closing credits.A beautiful movie about fame and family.An amusing, and occasionally touching meditation on fame, sibling rivalry and ambition, with a sweet payoff.One of the most hilarious, honest films about two brothers you\\'re ever likely to see.We learn almost nothing about the band, other than they\\'re fairly diligent and boring ...The film is helplessly, or craftily, scatter-shaped. Molecules fly everywhere: bits of concert footage, bits of serious or This is Spinal Tap -ish interviews; bits - or lots - of Tom existentially imploding.It could easily have been a workaday music doc, but amid all the gigs, pit stops and sound checks emerges a funny and wry story of brothers at work.A teasing essay on sibling tensions ... a backdrop for a gonzo self-portrait, a likeably self-deprecating music-biz counterpart to Louis C.K.\\'s TV shows.The best thing about Mistaken for Strangers, a new documentary about the band the National, is that you don\\'t have to be a fan to enjoy it.Mistaken for Strangers finds its footing in humor and good nature, and it\\'s a thoroughly feel-good rock documentary with massive audience appeal, National fans or not.The finest rock doc since Anvil: The Story of Anvil.Wry, awkward, funny and poignant, Mistaken For Strangers is somewhere between an accidental documentary and a home movie in motion.Both inspiring and profoundly entertaining.Very \"meta,\" very funny and very, very touching.For all their obvious differences, the bond between affable Tom and laser-intense Matt reveals itself in ways both subtle and profound.Alternately hilarious, cringe-inducing, inspiring, depressing, stupid and profoundly intelligent.If Mistaken For Strangers weren\\'t a documentary, it might have worked as a high-concept comedy.You don\\'t have to be a fan of the band to be touched by these disparate souls. It does help if you have endured or been either version of these brothers-black sheep or golden child.\"Mistaken for Strangers\" is, like its maker, scruffy, undisciplined and eager to be loved. The big surprise is how easy it is to comply. As a portrait of one man\\'s all-consuming persistence alone, it\\'s astonishing.Perhaps the ultimate take-away from Tim\\'s Vermeer is the unquenchable curiosity of certain people, albeit those with the money to finance that inquisitiveness, to get to the bottom of history\\'s mysteries. In that respect, Jenison is an artist.It\\'s obvious in hindsight why Penn and Teller would be so drawn to this ethereally beautiful mystery: Their passion for all things seemingly magical, often mechanical, and always amazing is practically their trademark.\"Tim\\'s Vermeer\" is about many things - art history, technology, painting technique, beauty - but ultimately it\\'s a beguiling study of fascination.We should never forget that Penn and Teller are professional bamboozlers, and their attempt to re-frame the definition of genius might be nothing but smoke and mirrors.Shot on grainy video, with some indifferent sound, Tim\\'s Vermeer is an amusing study of obsession in action.Unexpectedly dazzling.Tim\\'s Vermeer is film as forensics, bringing math and science to bear to solve an art-world mystery.\"Tim\\'s Vermeer\" is a movie for people who like to think, who like to ponder the big questions surrounding art and the act of creation.Mostly it is fascinating and compelling.Some movies are great because of their artistry; \"Tim\\'s Vermeer\" achieves greatness - OK, semi-greatness - by placing the act of artistic creation itself under a microscope.\"Tim\\'s Vermeer\" makes a convincing case that Vermeer could have painted the way Jenison says he did. It also makes a pretty powerful ancillary point: that some people are both geniuses and geeks.\"Tim\\'s Vermeer\" is a diverting 80-minute account of one man\\'s mission to explore the Vermeer optics theory in detail.As mechanical as the procedure it depicts.Tim\\'s Vermeer is a highly entertaining, provocative film about an amazing experiment, and it\\'s straightforward in its presentation and aims, throwing no curveballs.An improbable subject has inspired a unique documentary which comes with an unusual pedigree: it was produced by those inventive magicians Penn and Teller, and directed by Teller.Jenison\\'s obsession is the basis for a playful,entertaining film. I wasn\\'t convinced for a millisecond by his wackadoodle theory, but I enjoyed every minute of Tim\\'s Vermeer.Art purists can relax since [inventor Tim] Jenison, a video wiz with little talent for painting, never really challenges Vermeer\\'s genius for conception and composition. Technology is the thing at issue here.The movie is straightforward, brisk, engaging, and sometimes even moving.Teller, the quiet half of the iconoclastic magic act Penn and Teller, crafts a captivating documentary portrait of the artist as a tinkerer. A short, pungent, ambiguous portrait of the poorer sections of Baltimore and the young men who get their kicks riding dirt bikes through the streets en masse, popping wheelies and dodging the police.Documentary filmmaker Lotfy Nathan explores the outlaw appeal of an inner-city Baltimore dirt-bike gang through the eyes of a 13-year-old wannabe member named Pug.An exciting, beautifully shot look at a subculture through the eyes of one of its most devoted admirers.It could have romanticized its subjects, portraying them as outlaws and folk heroes. Or it could have gone the way of moral panic. To its credit, [it] does neither of these things - or, rather, it does both, in the most subtle and insightful way possible.Take a closer look, as Lofty Nathan does in his freewheeling debut feature... and bike gangs like the 12 O\\'Clock Boys start to differentiate as more than just a dangerous nuisance.[Pug is] a fiercely individual child, but, inevitably, his predicament also symbolizes how poverty can warp a good boy\\'s nature.[It] spectacularizes black criminality for white middle-class viewers, the primary audience for the festivals and art houses where this film will have its career.\"12 O\\'Clock Boys\" packs more life into its 72 minutes than many longer documentaries do.In this transfixing documentary about a Baltimore boy striving to join illegal urban dirt bikers, first-time filmmaker Lofty Nathan conjures a unique journalistic excitement.The young filmmaker rarely digs beneath the harsh environment\\'s many fraught surfaces. He simply lets his cameras be his guide.The film\\'s implication, that the rides need to be curtailed, seems obvious; and I can\\'t help thinking that Nathan realizes this, but stops short.Nathan\\'s film defies easy categorization; he\\'s interested in neither telling a fairy tale nor painting issues in broad strokes.As reticent as Nathan is to cast explicit judgment, the film shows the tragic impasse between a street culture that\\'s reckless and provocative, and a police force that exacerbates the problem with heavy-handed tactics.Nathan wisely avoids explicit commentary. He doesn\\'t need it: Coco\\'s angry frustration, Pug\\'s bruised confusion, and the police helicopters constantly hovering above the defiant bikers say enough.Its rhythm is the jagged rhythm of everyday life, and its primary asset is its unemphatic authenticity, offering a window into a very specific time and place.This visually stunning, thematically complex documentary will stir up a wide range of reactions.Engrossing if slightly slapdash.In slow-motion shots, Nathan captures the riders\\' pride in mastery and thrill in adventure.It constantly divides itself between fulfilling the conventions of the informational talking-heads documentary and aiming for a more poetically impressionistic quality.The film itself is a little too rough around the edges to fully engage. Fascinating subject, though. Questions of identity reverberate through The Dog, a documentary by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren that chronicles Wojtowicz\\'s storied and terribly sad life.There\\'s a brashness to this documentary that sneaks up on you.Try as you may, however, you can\\'t turn away from this obscure footnote in pop culture history, even at his most aggravating. It\\'s that twisted thing we call celebrity.Sidney Lumet\\'s Oscar-winning Dog Day Afternoon was based on a true story - and John Wojtowicz doesn\\'t even try to hide his glee in sharing every juicy, crazed detail in revealing documentary, The Dog.The result does justice to their subject\\'s foul-mouthed charm and braggadocio.In numerous interviews that careen from profane braggadocio to tender reminiscence, the lustily bisexual Wojtowicz comes across as almost bizarrely self-satisfied.The film keeps you riveted, yet its achievement is finally more humanistic than cinematic.It\\'ll leave you alternately amused and slack-jawed in astonishment.\"The Dog\" is a humbly extraordinary film.Outrageous, funny and sad.The film is a real \"whew\"-factor yarn, a hearty soup of thick accents, bold personalities and complicated motives, with an unmistakable taste of charismatic, ornery American hedonism.As a portrait of a life lived strangely-and if you asked its subject, perfectly, with no regrets-The Dog is charming.Part of what makes Mr. Wojtowicz such a fascinating character is that he seemed to rotate identities as easily as other people change socks, and without angst.Keraudren\\'s documentary fills in many fascinating details of Wojtowicz\\'s life ...Directors Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren fill \"The Dog\" with terrific archival footage that captures the feel, look and sound of a bygone, character-filled era.For all its eye-opening material, The Dog still feels unfinished, but for students of New York scuzziness, it\\'s an essential addition.What makes The Dog so compelling isn\\'t Wojtowicz\\'s cinematic imprint but the place in history that was very likely denied him by chance and his own irascibility.It\\'s informed with a subtle but disquieting subtext that insists on the pitfalls of allowing ideology to steer you away from common sense.Working as both an unofficial Dog Day sequel and unconventional overview of New York gay culture from the past 40 years, The Dog combines archival footage, still photographs, and testaments from many of those who knew Wojtowicz well.How often Hollywood embellishes. How rare, then, to find a documentary like The Dog, in which we discover that, if anything, Sidney Lumet\\'s Dog Day Afternoon left out much of the incredible story behind its 1972 hostage crisis. A thoroughly enjoyable and fascinating documentary about Landis\\' amazing feats as a forger and con man.It\\'s the kind of story a filmmaker dreams of - and yet, \"Art and Craft\" leaves the viewer uneasy.Much like the experts drawn to Landis\\' paintings, Art and Craft effectively invites viewers to question the honesty of what\\'s been placed inside the frame.Sam Cullman, Jennifer Grausman, and Mark Becker, the directors of \"Art and Craft,\" have themselves an enticing subject in Landis\\'s activities. They do not have an enticing subject in Landis himself.Directors Sam Cullman and Jennifer Grausman maintain a bright tone and a melancholy undercurrent, which combine in an eminently watchable character study.Wonderful and not a little sad.A fascinating look inside the troubled mind of a master of deception.Landis has made a lot of people very angry, and the movie deals with a serious issue - namely the way obsessions take control of us.A droll documentary that may remind you of Errol Morris\\' work.The constant scrutiny of a camera seems exploitative and cruel, even if you are at all suspicious when he rationalizes his behavior as childlike mischief.\"Nothing\\'s original under the sun,\" muses Mark Landis in the consistently compelling documentary \"Art and Craft.\" But he seems to be discounting himself.Mr. Landis, who lives in Laurel, Miss., and has operated under several pseudonyms, is the enigmatic core of a movie that becomes pedestrian only when the focus switches to a one-man crusade to expose him.Compelling but dubious ...Sympathetic yet gently unnerving ...This crazy-gazing docu never presumes to be much more than an extended version of the kind of story one might expect to see briefly spotlighted on 60 Minutes. Even so, all sorts of interesting questions.swirl beneath the surface.Deeply eccentric subject makes for an engaging art-doc.The filmmakers profile the prolific Mark Landis with a non-judgmental straightforwardness that allows the sheer brazenness of his scams to generate both shock and amusement. The film skillfully blends legalese with a humane portrait of the couples who are willing to fight the state for the right to wed.Ben Cotner and Ryan White treat us to a riveting, satisfying journey, thanks to incredible access to the plaintiffs and lawyers from the earliest stages of the lawsuit.What\\'s most compelling about The Case Against 8 is that it is not a partisan procedural.An accomplished and well-told piece of documentary journalism.The Case Against 8 is a documentary on the Californian repeal of same-sex marriage laws and has the tension of a legal thriller as well as being surprisingly moving in its final scenes.As passionate and wide-ranging as you\\'d hope, but disappointingly mistrusting of its audience\\'s interest in the finer points of the case.There are a few tears along the way and some laughter, but the four at the heart of the case display a remarkable stoicism and modesty, emerging as the most modest of heroes.The Case Against 8 documents, quietly and without histrionics, a long-drawn-out process of advocacy. It presents not only the legal conduct of the case, but also the daily lives of those most intimately affected by it.The Case Against 8 remains a powerful advocacy film as well as one of historical record.A slickly told tale that begs for movie-of-the-week treatment.Directors Ben Cotner and Ryan White are dedicated to getting it all in, which occasionally impedes the flow of the story.Even knowing the outcome, watching 8... is like watching a well-scripted legal thriller.The film beautifully connects the procedural ennui of large-scale legal cases with the individual struggles of those directly involved.A sprawling yet engrossing documentary about the five-year court battle to overturn California\\'s ban on gay marriage, known as Proposition 8.\"The Case Against 8\" functions as a valuable record of the nuts-and-bolts conference room side of advocacy - an aspect of civil rights work not often seen on screen.A thoroughly engaging documentary ...Filmmakers Cotner and White use fly-on-the-wall footage, fresh interviews and the reading of court transcripts to capture these intimate revelations, as well as the crackle of history in the making.The best kind of popular history, a film that trembles with tears and hope, and I dare you to get through it without bawling some yourself.The draw here is watching a careful process unfold, regardless of the outcome.Earnest, solid if somewhat plodding at times ... Krauss\\'s documentary is both solid and scathing, raising more questions that it answers.It\\'s a beautiful way to lose faith in humanity.It all adds up to a harrowing picture of the casualties of war - and the unchecked madness that may drive those entrusted to defend us.A military platoon bent on murdering Afghan civilians for pleasure is the target of this chillingly frank documentary.The scope of the film can be frustratingly narrow. But even this limited view into the events of the Maywand District murders is gripping cinema.Over and over, Winfield\\'s distraught parents ask, rhetorically, what choice their son had. Thing is, the answer is right in the film ...The movie\\'s haunting power stems from a paradox at the heart of its narrative.A terrifying example of how easily basic human decency and morality can melt away in the fog of war.It offers a deep, troubling probe into a military culture that both incubates horrifically criminal acts against innocents and throws innumerable obstacles in the paths of soldiers who would thwart or report those outrages.Looks at the murders and their aftermath through a frustratingly narrow lens.The setting is Afghanistan, but it might be Iraq or Vietnam or anywhere with occupying forces. It might be Gaza. This map of hell is timeless, placeless.Finds drama in evenhanded storytelling that is the inverse of its characters\\' emotional shakiness.The film is weak on its essential indictment, vaguely suggesting a mood of battlefield boredom without quite pinpointing the pathology that would lead military men to squeeze the trigger pell-mell.It\\'s hard to watch, but important to witness.The mesmerizing documentary about a group of U.S. soldiers killing Afghan citizens for kicks, circa 2010, has the kind of urgent intimacy that characterizes the best such non-fiction films.A blood-boiling documentary whose constrained viewpoint on its subject -- U.S. soldiers\\' sport-killing of Afghan civilians in 2010, and the prosecutions that followed -- doesn\\'t prevent it from moving viewers to the point of despair.This chilling war-is-hell expose [is] must-see viewing.This is a rare War on Terror military expos, one almost exclusively interested in the hearts and minds of low-ranking soldiers.[A] gripping documentary.\"The Kill Team\" is emotionally heavy; as you watch, you feel conflicted about Winfield\\'s role and about your own perception of right and wrong. Sincere and unexpectedly good, the film happily reintroduces another element of classic kids\\' movies: a tidy 77-minute run time.\"Bears\" could have used a lot more science; more substantive information in the place of wacky one-liners. Still, the images trump everything.Bonus points for all but eliminating the easy scatological humor. Does a bear (poop) in the woods? You won\\'t find out watching \"Bears.\"There are grittier nature documentaries out there, but \"Bears\" is simple and effective, and delivered with that friendly Disney touch. Its intent is to make you say, \"awww,\" and it does its job well.All this is heartwarming, in a bloody, ursine-centric way.Despite the bracing beauty of the wilderness, and the respite provided by cubs at play, the movie is primarily a sobering treatise on survival.The \"nature\" aspects of Bears are undercut by the need to turn this into a live-action Disney cartoon, complete with cuddly heroes and nasty villains.The devotion and persistence of these animals is a powerful reminder that family connections link all species. With this peek into their world, we are more aware of our own.If the sight of bear cubs prancing through wildflowers doesn\\'t make you smile, then you probably won\\'t like the new Disneynature documentary Bears. You also probably aren\\'t human.As with all of Disneynature\\'s features, there\\'s astonishing documentary work on display in \"Bears\" - but a leaner, less conspicuously structured view of the wild might have had even greater impact.An enjoyable and visually stunning romp through the scenic Alaskan wilderness with a small family of bears.As with Fothergill\\'s previous nature documentaries, \"Bears\" is a story of triumph and family.The astounding footage of a mother bear and two cubs fishing, fighting and hanging tough through a challenging year of foraging transcends the folksy narration.Amid its heaping serving of cuddliness ... the film doesn\\'t sugarcoat the harsh reality and unforgiving elements with which the bears have to contend.The Disneynature movies shouldn\\'t be mistaken for traditional documentary, but if they act as a gateway drug for young children to learn more about the animal kingdom, then the films are serving a real purpose.A formulaically entertaining combination of gorgeous cinematography and unapologetic anthropomorphization.Don\\'t look for Disneynature\\'s \"Salmon\" anytime soon.Although Bears doesn\\'t have a stated green message, it\\'s hard to see the majestic natural beauty presented onscreen and not feel stewardship urges.There\\'s only so much editing can do to make a bear story seem like a human one, and the filmmakers (Alastair Fothergill and Keith Scholey directed) also go to unfortunate lengths to give human characteristics like laziness to the bears.Bears works very well as an emotional story of survival and family. But at 77-minutes, it felt a little overlong. Director Jennifer M. Kroot delivers something that is as profound as it is funny and uplifting.With his trademark baritone and focused diction, Takei is a natural storyteller who lends an enjoyable flow to the movie\\'s uncomplicated proceedings.To Be Takei is a celebration of a man of great resilience, infectious humor, a voracious appetite for the richness of the human experience, and the best laugh in the history of laughing.While there\\'s pathos and tragedy here, there\\'s also good humor and human strength.This is a film blessed with excellent footage and plenty of nice moments.Another pleasant if disposable portrait.This could have easily been a platitudinous, self-important mess, but Kroot does a couple of very savvy things here.Conventional documentary or not, I got something of positive value and insight out of \"To Be Takei.\"What made and makes Takei a powerful spokesman is obvious in the film.Chats with \"Trek\" cast members and other Takei friends and supporters, plus a wealth of family and archival photos and footage, complete this lively tribute.Much more than a \"Star Trek\" footnote or a standard coming-out story.[Ms. Kroot\\'s] banalizing documentary is self-defeating ...The energetic and upbeat actor is also a same-sex marriage activist and social media superstar. But the outgoing man we meet onscreen also has a quieter side.Like its subject, \"To Be Takei\" is very likable.Director Jennifer Kroot\\'s good-natured biography is so appealing that even non-Trekkies may be convinced we needed a full-length documentary about the man who was Sulu.Takei alternates among admirable but uninspiring lecturing, the usual un-insightfully laudatory talking heads, and the dullest parts of the actor\\'s days.The doc works best as a relationship study, filled with endearing moments of intimate bickering.If witnessing Takei and Brad exchanging vows doesn\\'t bring a tear to your eye, you\\'re either heartless, or you\\'re William Shatner.Jennifer M. Kroot plays things a bit too straight and safe by giving into basic emotional and thematic possibilities of each period in Takei\\'s prolific early life and subsequent Hollywood career.It\\'s more than just \\'OK to be Takei.\\' Overall, Amy is a stunning, beautiful, and deeply personal, if somewhat voyeuristic, portrait of one of the greatest artists of a generation.Guys, after watching the 128-minute film, I can honestly say that I have never seen a documentary that has turned me off so much as this one has.Kapadia\\'s documentary -- which uses home video, archival footage, and clips of concerts and old and new interviews -- feels a bit like a horror film, except the inescapable monster is fame.There are a couple of scenes in Asif Kapadia\\'s new Amy Winehouse documentary, Amy, that make the fame-industrial complex seem rock-bottom awful.[Kapadia] leaves you with is an incredible feeling of sadness, irrespective of whether you knew and liked her music or not.A powerful, and powerfully sad, experience.A mesmerizing yet devastating look at a singular talent.It\\'s Amy\\'s words, her music, her voicemails, her home videos, her friends, her family, her tormentors, and her timeless incandescence. Look, listen and weep.Plenty of folks praise Winehouse in \"Amy.\" But no one was there to save her. Perhaps it wasn\\'t possible. But perhaps it was.The film is often uncomfortable to watch, prompting that little voice inside each of us to scream out \"Somebody help her!\"One thing is for certain: It will be much harder to hear that handful of powerful, lush, carnal songs on Back to Black without the wallop of melancholy.\"Amy\" doesn\\'t depart from the standard behind-the-music template, but it does deepen the format immeasurably, through the intimacy of its archival materials and the focus of its approach.The film is remarkable not just for the immense talent there to see in Winehouse\\'s performances, but the fact that there is so much to see.\"Amy,\" Asif Kapadia\\'s documentary about the short, tragic life of British retro soul singer Amy Winehouse, is a heartbreaker.Kapadia\\'s illuminating, compassionate and tragic doc goes way up and way, way down with the gone-too-soon Amy Winehouse.A loving but honest portrayal of a doomed talent.Kapadia and King provide some worthy insights about the damaging effects of celebrity on psychologically fragile individuals. And the music is fantastic.To his credit, [director Asif] Kapadia allows the murk of recollected events to complicate matters, and everyone gets their say.It\\'s hard to watch. And even harder to look away.In Kapadia\\'s assured and careful hands, the film becomes less a portrait of a tragic artist, whose downward spiral was exacerbated by opportunistic family members and colleagues, than a discomfiting mirror held up to her audience. Not only a very fine documentary, but a warm and likable one to boot.There\\'s no pressing story to tell, or even especially vital achievement to record, so the film probably counts as bit of self-indulgence from Hawke, but it\\'s got a very good heart.The great joy of the film, whether you know piano or not, is watching Bernstein teach.Hawke\\'s cinematic etude may not unlock all the mysteries of music, but \"Seymour: An Introduction\" is universal enough to be understood by a bananafish.Coming off of his superb one-two performances for Richard Linklater in Before Midnight and Boyhood, Hawke continues to work at a creative high level. He demonstrates a rapport and openness with his subject that proves exceptionally affecting.Whether or not Hawke got any answers to his questions about the purpose of being artist, seeking them under the guidance of a teacher like Bernstein resulted in this work of art.Seymour: An Introduction is just that - not too much biography, or history. And one needn\\'t be a music aficionado, or a musician, to appreciate the modest erudition coming from this man.By the end of our introduction, Bernstein emerges as a man who has found a way to build order out of life\\'s chaos through music.Hawke chose well his subject; Bernstein is indeed an intriguing master and paragon of authenticity.His playing is beautiful - he was a gifted concert pianist who gave up the stage at 50 to concentrate on teaching and composing. His stories are tremendous. And his voice, clear and strong, is magnetic.\"Seymour: An Introduction\" gives viewers a soaring, sublime and enduringly meaningful glimpse of a man who is undoubtedly the real thing.It\\'s hard to find much wrong with this film, itself a meditation on art and the practice of craft.The movie\\'s real subject is the difficulty -- and the critical importance -- of bringing into harmony one\\'s personal and artistic lives, of being not only a good artist but a joyful one.Seymour: An Introduction is a delightful film experience about the transformative power of art.Bernstein in action is a study of what a teacher should be: kind but with a steely resolve. He analyzes the music and figures how to overcome its obstacles.A fondly made portrait ... of a gentle philosopher with a wicked wit, a superbly talented pianist who intellectually challenges and charms in equal parts.Unusual, intelligent documentary whose subject is a pleasure to spend time with.Hawke\\'s first documentary is a perfect movie for a gray Sunday afternoon, a gentle and loving tribute to a man ... anachronistically convinced that talent is its own reward.The sweetness of the subject\\'s nature and the gentle modulations of his speaking voice are so potent that it would seem not just uncivil but futile to contradict him; yet Hawke is too alert and too inquiring to let the movie subside into worship.The unfortunate disconnect between great artistry and great commercial success runs throughout history. But Bernstein is a special case because, unlike so many great musicians who fell unwillingly by the wayside, he chose his own path. There is, for all the frivolity of her business, a gravitas and magnetism about Iris Apfel: she\\'s smart and funny and sassy enough for the viewer to see past a life of privilege and walk-in wardrobes.Maysles often said that he made [his films] with a sense of love for his subjects. That is certainly true of this film, which is a great parting gift to us all.She emerges here as a down-to-earth, self-mocking, savvy philosopher, a one-off combination of Madame de Pompadour and a borscht-belt standup: it\\'s not just Iris\\'s glasses that recall George Burns, but her wit too.A love letter to individualism, and the love that fuels it.Late director Albert Maysles (Gimme Shelter) beautifully captures her personality and her passion for creativity.The director\\'s way with framing and composition hadn\\'t deserted him even at this late stage - every shot is a box of delights.Albert Maysles\\'s last film is a typically deft exercise in subtle observation.A glorious documentary fashionistas will want to study, frame by frame, while the rest of us are inspired by Apfel\\'s zest for life and fondness for costume jewellery on an epic scale.It\\'s an affectionate, slight, minor work.All you truly need know is she is a joy, a wonder, and terrific, as is this film.This woman has plenty of blunt wisdom to share.\\'Iris\" is a joyful look at an aging eccentric and an examination of the playful nature of design and fashion; it likely won\\'t change your life, but will bring a smile to your face.A flurry of excitement greets her wherever she goes; throughout the adulation, she is appreciative, patiently bemused, a little cranky and only occasionally tickled.Iris is an absolute kick, whether or not you care a whit about the world this character is moving through. And she is a character, with her big round glasses and her big opinions.Iris is a potent argument against fast fashion, fast anything. And as a quiet cataloging of a couple slowing down and accessorized with wheelchairs, walking sticks, and hands tightly clasped, it becomes a poignant snatch of real-time aging.Maysles simply presents lots of other designers telling Apfel how brilliant she is, their testimony interspersed with pithy accounts of her past achievements.The film plays like a refreshingly frank visit with a favorite relative.Flamboyantly fashionable and filter-free, 93-year-old Iris Apfel is a delightfully quirky muse for legendary documentary filmmaker Albert Maysles\\'s final solo film, Iris.\"Iris\" serves as a spirited, often dazzling primer in how to fight the dying of the light and feel fabulous while doing it.Intimate, knowing portrait of a fashion icon who knows exactly who and what she is, and is often surrounded by people who don\\'t. The film finds its biggest strengths in the quiet moments with Davis\\'s parents as they attempt to move through the grief of losing their only child.While \"Justice for Jordan\" may have been served, the words - and Davis\\' story - are yet another reminder of a nation that remains fractured by inequality, desperately in need of change.While the documentary itself merely gives the audience a bird\\'s eye view of the courtroom narrative, it punctuates the point that is too often forgotten in these cases: It is Dunn who is on trial here, not Davis.Cleanly presented and crisply framed, each image is shot with a respectfully detached gaze, from the talking heads to the twisting Floridian highways shot at golden hour. Sadly, this means that Silver\\'s treatment of the case feels overly forensic.We must not just simply remember, we must stand up and demand our humanity. If we don\\'t, we\\'ve let Jordan Davis down and after seeing, 3 1/2 Minutes, 10 Bullets that is the last thing that you will want to do.What the documentary the filmmakers have assembled is educational, eye opening, often emotional, sad and galvanizing.A compelling courtroom documentary.Offering a balanced but impassioned account of the case, Silver, director of 2013\\'s Who Is Dayani Cristal?, puts the viewer in the position of the jury ...Silver remains exceptionally clear-eyed. The result is a powerful, gripping and deeply shocking film, and a contemptuous critique of Florida\\'s stand-your-ground law.It\\'s a grimly absorbing watch.A uniquely compelling real-life legal thriller.The prosecution and defense unfold with the suspense of a Hollywood courtroom drama.Marc Silver\\'s moving and illuminating documentary \"3 1/2 Minutes, Ten Bullets\" reveals a lot about what is wrong in the United States today and a little bit of what\\'s right.The straightforward, well-edited trial scenes speak volumes, not only about the defendant, but also about the racism that still haunts our country.A deep core of emotion gives \"3?√á√® 1/2 Minutes, Ten Bullets\" its ballast, but Silver, who also serves as cinematographer, infuses the production with simple, elegant sophistication.The heartache and outrage are there already. The movie wisely doesn\\'t force it.The film on the whole feels restrained considering the scope of the rage and sadness in play.It\\'s told in a contemplative style that brings the story\\'s emotions to life without hyping them.At the time of a fervent national debate on race and justice, part of what is impressive about \"3 1/2 Minutes\" is the cool temperature at which it is often served.A barbed inquiry into this particular notion of \"self-defense,\" enabled by the quotidian racism state and perpetuated de jure by the state. Every scene weighs on the audience. But Oppenheimer and Adi manage to locate a lightness as well that lessens the burden.Oppenheimer\\'s follow-up, The Look of Silence, is more lucid but less interesting.oshua Oppenheimer has followed his 2012 documentary, The Act of Killing, with another, even more powerful film, The Look of Silence.If Killing was a cleverer film and perhaps a more \"informative\" one (if you want to learn about the Indonesian killings, at least), then Silence is a more gut-wrenching one.\"The Look of Silence\" is so disturbing because so few people in it seem disturbed.A reminder that the architects of a massive tragedy remain present and unrepentant, the personification of the evil men do and a warning that it could happen again.Killing focused on the surreal reenactment of mass genocide by its elderly perpetrators. Silence makes it personal.The Look of Silence couldn\\'t possibly equal its predecessor, but it\\'s still a wrenching and unforgettable experience.\"The Look of Silence\" is painful and unforgettable - a serious and honorable form, perhaps the highest, of \"gotcha\" journalism imaginable.In contrast to the sometimes lurid tenor of The Act of Killing, and despite the extremity of its own content, Oppenheimer\\'s follow-up has a calm, contemplative tone.There\\'s a rage far beneath Adi\\'s placid expression and the director\\'s dispassionate style. It\\'s not a rage for vengeance but anger at an all-consuming blindness.A ... profoundly shattering movie.It\\'s a testimony to how much this is a live issue in Indonesia that some of the credits are listed simply as \"anonymous.\"My relief in watching this movie, which once again recounts the slaughters in great, almost fetishistic detail, is that at least the victims are allowed a voice this time.The stories the perpetrators tell are hideous, but Adi proves to be a calm and unrelenting interrogator, even in the face of direct death threats.The film is all the more potent for its restraint, as constant on the mind as the cicadas that sound throughout the unyielding night.A shocking and significant film, a further illumination of one of recent history\\'s great horrors, a documentary that will make a difference in the world. It is also an exceptionally difficult film to actually watch.In a way, I wish I\\'d never seen \"The Look of Silence,\" because now I won\\'t be able to forget it. But that\\'s the point ...The Look of Silence in some ways manages to burrow deeper into your soul...and your nightmares.A superior work of confrontational boldness, it might be the movie Oppenheimer wanted to make in the first place. Despite its historical subject, \"Hitchcock/Truffaut\" adeptly proves the timelessness of cinema.Jones has laid enough of a foundation on Hitchcock\\'s style that viewers can watch one of cinema\\'s most famous moments with fresh eyes.It brings the pages to life with clips and photos and the sound of the directors talking seriously and less seriously.Pretension is always with us, but the documentary\\'s main effect will surely be to make you want to see Hitchcock\\'s films (including the marvel that is Marnie) all over again.It is filled with revelations and also, of course, filled with excerpts from some of the greatest films ever made.Cinema is a discussion, a process of learning from one filmmaker and teaching to the next, and in that wonderful way, \\'Hitchcock/Truffaut\\' isn\\'t just about that book. It is that book.It\\'s great to hear audio of these exchanges, and the new interviews that make up the bulk of the film are entertaining, erudite, and (most importantly) refreshingly enthusiastic.If nothing else, it works as an essential complement to the bookThe only drawbacks to an excellent documentary are the skimpy treatment of Hitchcock\\'s 1930s British work and the lack of diversity among the interviewees. Jones could have included at least one or two female film-makers.What a gorgeous and enlightening documentary Hitchcock/Truffaut is, even for the non-cinephile.It\\'s hard not to be infectiously drawn in by the passion on display here.The material begs for a much longer consideration than the film\\'s trim 79 minutes, but it\\'s still a must-watch for serious film fans.A landmark film book gets its just deserts. The cleverly curated clips are stunning and the analysis thought-provoking in this richly rewarding piece.An engaging film.Anytime you get smart and accomplished filmmakers talking about film, theory and their respective styles, the results are rewarding.You won\\'t have a merrier time at the movies this holiday season.The two men come alive (responses that seemed dry or diffident on paper are tinged with humor, with audacity, even), and so, too, do the images.The meeting of the two men becomes increasingly fruitful, and there\\'s the sense of a private genius finally allowing himself to tip his hand.In an age in which celebrity gossip and page views trump all, hearing two masters talk intelligently about movies and how they\\'re made is, if nothing else, a welcome treat.If the documentary concentrates on the mechanical aspects of filmmaking, that\\'s clearly because it was Hitchcock\\'s preference. Of the many films that have been made about Kurt Cobain, documentary and fiction, [director Brett] Morgen\\'s is the best because what it leaves us with is the one thing that most defined his life: empathy.It\\'s a rare profile that\\'s about the person instead of the personality, the artist instead of the art.Montage of Heck isn\\'t an investigation into its subject\\'s death so much as an homage to his creativity and life force -- it\\'s tender and sad.We see-almost from the inside-the evolution of Cobain\\'s sensitive brilliance and the art and destruction that it fed.Morgen and his editors have simply done a remarkable job -- also an artful one -- in piecing together this residuum.Montage of Heck is about the representation and self-representation of Kurt Cobain, a fascinating process for any figure whose entire fame was based on modes of self-representation.On the subject of the life and death of Kurt Cobain there is still some work to be done, but Montage of Heck may be as close as we\\'ll get to moving on.A masterful and often deeply moving portrait of a volatile American genius, a portrait that goes far beyond one man, one family and one rain-sodden small town.Cobain\\'s life has been chronicled in scores of books and documentaries, but Montage of Heck feels fresh in the scope of material it includes, the way it\\'s presented, and the things it emphasizes.Montage understands Cobain as an icon, but also as the mixed-up kid who got too famous too fast, and it seems content revealing, rather than reconciling, his contradictions.The result is a stunning audio-video hodgepodge that, in almost every case, captures some underlying essence of the Nirvana frontman.Morgen teases out aspects of Cobain\\'s life that had been largely overlooked, in particular his intense ambition to succeed and his huge fear of humiliation if he didn\\'t.Morgen draws no distinction between meaningful artistic creation and the expression of private pain. Then again, blurring that distinction was always part of Nirvana\\'s achievement.Montage of Heck is a fascinating look at the man who created music that still matters to so many people.His story is undoubtedly a tragedy and Morgen paints it like it was in a stylish juxtaposition of traditional biography and adventurous, raw filmmaking.There\\'s an important critical dictum when one reviews documentaries that we need to be careful to focus on the form of the filmmaking as much as the content. Filmmaking matters more than subject matter. In this case, both are brilliant.I couldn\\'t keep myself from mouthing the words. I couldn\\'t keep the sobs from rising in my throat.The genius of the Montage is that Morgen eschews not only predictability, but also the pretext of trying to give definitive answers when the more rewarding path to understanding Cobain\\'s life and career is through questions.An often brilliant, sometimes overheated but always humane documentary, one in which Nirvana\\'s music and fame is just the scaffolding to Cobain\\'s inner life.The rarity of [the] source materials alone makes this film a must-see for any hard-core Nirvana fan. Anyone who watches this lively documentary will fall a little bit in love with one of cinema\\'s romantic rebels.It would have been nice to have examined more of Bergman\\'s odd transatlantic career -- glimpses of an early screen test can only be described as ravishing -- but classic Hollywood buffs will be well-served, nonetheless.An intimate, involving portrait of a remarkable woman who blazed her own independent path in love and on screen.The film is never less than engaging and it is a treasure trove of wonderful images.Ingrid Bergman\\'s unique beauty, ageing fascinatingly and gracefully in closeup, is utterly beguiling.An intimate and at times unforgiving portrait of a wife, mother and megastar.An intimate, if unanalytical, portrait of one of movies greatest talents, told in her own words and through an adroitly assembled use of fantastic home movie footage.The film is riveting when it delves into the complex family dynamics, but it could have used some tightening.The full force of Bergman\\'s charm comes across in Stig Bjrkman\\'s revelatory documentary Ingrid Bergman: In Her Own Words.Using a variety of sources, Swedish film critic Stig Bjorkman created this revealing documentary about the resilient movie star who won three Academy Awards and worked with Bogart, Hitchcock, Ingmar Bergman and Roberto Rossellini.In its occasionally over-gentle way, the documentary testifies to the ego necessary to be a great star and to live a great life.Devotees of classic Hollywood will miss this movie at their peril.The screen, always Bergman\\'s supreme medium, is proof of the power of her magnetic and energetic presence.Documentarian Stig Bjrkman has sifted through a hefty amount of material to construct a telling portrait of an intriguing star.\"She went where the wind took her,\" Pia Lindstrm says, and this revealing film shows where those destinations were.It was quite a life.A rich, generous-spirited portrait of a woman who, in her unapologetic pursuit of art, fame and personal growth, was far ahead of her time.There isn\\'t a lot here about her films, or great performances, but this is two hours of Ingrid Bergman, much of it rarely seen before. I\\'m not about to complain.Cinephile catnip.\"I don\\'t demand much,\" the film quotes her as saying. \"I just want everything.\" She got a lot, and gave immeasurably more. Much is hinted at, then skipped over. But Brando at least leaves us feeling there were real depths there: the angst was genuine, he took his art seriously.Through its ups and downs, Listen to Me, at its core, is a gift for the fans. It\\'s like an audiobook for the cinephiles and Brando lovers-almost like a bedtime story from Brando himself.There are plenty of posthumous profile pieces, of course, but Listen to Me Marlon is unique in that the dearly departed is the only one permitted to speak. It\\'s more of a s??ance than a documentary.An essential document for anybody even peripherally interested in this great, mumbling enigma.Approaches Brando\\'s life and work as you might a kind of seance - a journey into the spirit world.Built upon Brando\\'s archive of self-analysing audio tapes, Stevan Riley\\'s intimate documentary gets under the actor\\'s skin to reveal a troubled, fragile, self-obsessed soul.Moving and revelatory.Like the man himself, compelling and confounding in equal measure.\"Listen to my voice,\" he says, in a soft adenoidal whisper. \"Just let go,\" adds the Godfather star and Greatest American Screen Actor Who Ever Lived, before pausing dramatically, and topping it off with, \"Let your mind drift.\"There\\'s an eerie, unearthly fascination to this documentary ...Listen to Me Marlon is a documentary portrait of Marlon Brando that has him burbling into your ear for 102 minutes, but if you have to have someone burbling in your ear for 102 minutes, you could do a lot worse.There is delight and distress in equal measure: for his talent, mischief, waywardness, for the disillusionment and tragedy of his later years. Unique.Listen to Me Marlon is an offer so intimate that no film fan should refuse.It\\'s a one-of-a-kind film about a one-of-a-kind screen legend, a man who transformed acting without ever really knowing what he thought of it.A fascinating and extraordinary journey.More than a Hollywood bio, Listen to Me Marlon is a story of demons being passed from one generation to the next.Using a ghostly digital rendition of the actor\\'s face on a computer screen to embody his words, the filmmakers make Brando eerily come alive at times to tell his story. Wow. It\\'s nothing short of transcendent.It\\'s as if Riley has ushered us into the darkened chamber of the actor\\'s memories, where Brando himself can whisper in our ear.It\\'s a thoroughly subjective and effective attempt to capture how it must have felt to be Marlon Brando.Riley\\'s film brings the American icon\\'s career back into sharp focus. It\\'s a richer portrait than we might expect in an abysmal era of reality TV.It\\'s a complex portrait of class conflict, sad family legacies, and the dangerous allure of the spotlight.Finders Keepers has the sort of plot that no screenwriter in his or her right mind would ever dream up.Filmmakers Bryan Carberry and Clay Tweel, over the film\\'s quick 84 minutes, find some humanity and pathos in the story, which eventually takes an unexpectedly heartwarming turn.You might not think that a documentary about two men fighting over a severed leg would be funny, touching, and insightful, but it is.What starts out as a freak show ends up a poignant tale of tragedy, redemption, and the boon of taxidermy.What could easily be a silly saga or a simple indictment of the culture of fame becomes something diabolically more insightful and uplifting.Finders Keepers sees the tragedy in Whisnant\\'s egomania. As he agrees to a tacky reality show, we realize he\\'s peddling something more valuable than a leg - he\\'s selling his soul.What starts out alternately comic and catastrophic ends in unforeseen poignancy in \"Finders Keepers,\" a documentary that proves that truth is stranger than fiction. Way stranger.It\\'s one of the weirdest stories put to film this year, but it\\'s what makes it familiar that makes it haunting.A fantastic story that touches upon all-American notions of celebrity, redemption, family, justice, class, meme culture-all which came together with a kooky news segment.It\\'s a wild yarn, but that\\'s all Finders Keepers aspires to be; its gestures toward any statements about class and micro-celebrity are fleeting and half-hearted.A rich tale of two colourful North Carolina men whose legal wrangling over one of their amputated legs becomes a springboard for social commentary about our fame-mad times, as well as a moving portrait of broken lives and uneasy second chances.An epic battle over an amputated leg.In 82 svelte minutes, Finders Keepers encapsulates something ineffable about the modern American experience.As Finders Keepers gets weirder, it also gets better and deeper.Hysterical, insightful and genuinely empathetic ...The bittersweet conclusion of Finders Keepers suggests that the important question is not whether we can retrieve what is lost or fulfill impossible dreams, but how we respond to those failures.As the filmmakers follow the story over seven years, the movie becomes richer and more empathetic. The events are absurd, but the emotions merely human.Shockingly funny, weirdly touching ... Like much of Anderson\\'s work, Heart of a Dog takes the form of casually constructed, almost meandering reminiscences, while at the same time never losing its tightly structured focus and drive.... it restores a sense of calm to its subject without evading the most haunting questions.The film is often notable for Anderson\\'s honesty.An unclassifiable but strangely charming combination of reminiscence and fantasy, this is worth seeking out not only for Anderson fans but also for anyone interested in experimental cinema.Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein and 9/11 are all thrown into the mix with a lightness of touch at once ephemeral and profound.Nothing if not original, this is almost certainly the only movie about a terrier that cites the writing of Wittgenstein and Kierkegaard, the painting of Goya and the wisdom of Jewish grandmothers.It\\'s less like a lecture than a waking dream, perhaps even a form of hypnosis.[A] playful, haunting film.I found it a bit weird, I grant you, but also wise and thought-provoking -- and strangely hypnotic.Language becomes the great unifier in Heart of a Dog. Anderson\\'s nimble words cascade together, gathering momentum and meaning through jarring edits and clashes of imagery.The deeply moving and strangely exhilarating Heart of a Dog is experimental artist Laurie Anderson\\'s tribute to her late, beloved rat terrier, Lolabelle.It\\'s an odd, wandering trip, but Anderson\\'s personal touch makes it work.Heart of a Dog is a unique, indescribable beast, Anderson narrating over a collage of 8mm home video, iPhone footage, canine-level camera, and animation. If it sometimes wanders a little far afield, it snaps back quickly with some sharp observations.Alternately abstract and literal, the film works best when what we see on screen doesn\\'t align with what we\\'re hearing.Laurie Anderson\\'s Heart of a Dog is not just a movie but a guided meditation, drawing viewers into a state of peaceful contemplation from which they can consider such subjects as death, loss, and unconditional love.Ghosts haunt Heart of a Dog - but so, too, does love.It is a celebration of life, and how special it is to be a part of it while we\\'re here.As meditations go, it\\'s a collegial meander through the ways we process life in the face of death, using a collage style that combines her own artwork, 8-mm home movies from childhood, and original footage and musical compositions.The wide swerve of Anderson\\'s associations, their \"hypnotic splattered mist,\" don\\'t make for an easy film. But it is a very good one and only the hardest heart will leave the theatre unmoved.A dog is at the heart of this film, but there\\'s room for all manner of extraordinary insights about finding love and giving love, being canine and being human. Sherpa is different and arresting: it\\'s an old-fashioned documentary that allows the participants to tell their stories.Sherpa is an accomplished, gripping film.The landscapes are gorgeous; the ironies stark.For all its awe-inspiring scenery, this is a story of exploited labour\\'s struggle for power, of workers taking control of their workplace.There is bad faith on all sides but, amid all the bickering about money and safety, Peedom always also pays attention to the courage and selflessness of her subjects.Smart, genuine, thoughtful film-making.This is a spectacular, intimate and politically provocative expos of the dangers, racial tensions and harsh economic realities on the world\\'s highest mountain.In telling the Sherpa\\'s story, Peedom has delivered a damning indictment of Western imperialism.A riveting document of a unique industrial dispute.The documentary maker Jennifer Peedom went to explore the Sherpas\\' world and village life -- and their exploitation, which means they may be paid $5,000 for a summer\\'s work, while visitors pay $75,000 for a single death-defying trip.An exceptionally absorbing documentary.A documentary whose visual magnificence is more than matched by unforgettable characters and political urgency.Rarely are documentaries as powerfully polemic and jaw-gapingly spectacular as Sherpa.This film from experienced Aussie documaker Jennifer Peedom packs an emotional punch to match its awe-inspiring imagery.Very likely the most majestic-looking industrial dispute documentary ever made, the icy blue environment an awe-inspiring backdrop for a film largely about employment conditions and worker\\'s rights. Whatever his foibles, An Honest Liar depicts a great American original...Mankind may be awash in more con men and faith-based swindlers than ever, but precious few are bold enough to step forward into the light of reason, even for a million bucks. Bravo, Mr. Randi.\"An Honest Liar\" is a fascinating look at what the truth means, and how it means different things to different people. It\\'s also a reminder that no one has a monopoly on it. Not even the Amazing Randi.Anyone who can challenges faith healers, psychics and mediums who claim a special bond with the dead - and often wins those challenges - deserves a standing ovation.Randi\\'s story suggests a modern-day footnote to Herman Melville\\'s novel The Confidence-Man, reflecting the strange interplay between show business, religion, and hucksterism in American life.Randi\\'s a sly charmer, and an engaging guide through the film ...After getting to know the TV personality who unmasked psychics as simply magicians themselves, it makes getting to know the man behind the crusade even more powerful.Unexpectedly revelatory and deeply moving.It would violate a taboo to relate how this movie magic, masterfully orchestrated by Weinstein and Measom, is done. Their film is as smooth as Randi\\'s patter and demonstrates how the documentarian\\'s camera is quicker than the eye.In the end, \"An Honest Liar\" becomes a far more layered tale than it starts out to be.A worthwhile portrayal of an intelligent and skilled old-school conjuror who can look the audience in the eye and say, \"I\\'m a deceiver and I\\'m going to deceive you,\" and then do just that.\"An Honest Liar\" isn\\'t simply a career recap or a fond portrait; the movie takes exhilarating turns as directors Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom follow present-day developments in Randi\\'s personal life.Documenting a lifetime spent gulling audiences and pursuing con men, the directors Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom have produced a jaunty, jovial portrait with a surprising sting in its tail.The film deserves to be seen, and admired, for its own revelations, and for its unlikely, yet deeply affecting, transformation into a story of abiding love that, in its own turn, involves a deception.The doc makes a hairpin turn into sentiment, as the realities of immigration law impose themselves on Randi\\'s private relationship with his Venezuelan lover of 25 years.Intriguing stuff.Plays more like a greatest hits compilation than a biography ...Bounces along enjoyably on a sea of archival clips from Randi\\'s high-profile career, with latter-day input from numerous celebrity pals (and at least one famous foe).Aptly seductive ...Directors Tyler Measom and Justin Weinstein turn a standard bio-doc about an extraordinary man into a rumination on the blurred line between trickery and truth. Wenders showcases his work while giving him a platform to express his philosophical and political views. The doc benefits from a subtly affecting use of music.Salgado proves an adept and compassionate storyteller, his training as an economist providing sociopolitical insight into the suffering (manmade rather than natural) that threatens to engulf his work.Wenders introduces us to an intelligent, rigorous man who thinks hard about the structures that impose hardship on the powerless.Wim Wenders\\' master stroke in The Salt of the Earth is to let the photographs of Sebasti?√∫o Salgado speak for themselves.Sebasti?√∫o Salgado has spent his career documenting human suffering. And yet this quiet, dignified film about the 71-year-old will leave you twitching with envy. His, truly, has been a life well-lived.The standout images should stay with viewers for the foreseeable future.Some of his Salgado\\'s depictions of human suffering are not for the faint-hearted but, like this fine film, demand to be seen. Unmissable.Finally, it seems as if Salgado has gone beyond humanity in depicting the natural world: landscapes without people. His best work seems to transcend history itself.The Salt of the Earth travels to the heart of darkness, but thankfully comes out on the other side and leaves you with a hopefulness that no matter what kind of madness and repression happen in the world, there is still hope for humanity.Stunning imagery and a stirring story, about Sebastiao Salgado and his 40-odd years of shooting global catastrophe.The authenticity and artistry of the images in \"The Salt of the Earth\" cannot be denied. In any context, they\\'d be unforgettable.The Salt of the Earth is a celebration of the power of art to change the world, as well as an exploration of the considerable toll gifted artists sometimes pay for their talents.It presents us with the portrait of a man who started out as an economist, discovered his vocation, travelled the world, immersed himself in his self-imposed task and encountered extremes of human behaviour.The film takes its time, and even seems to meander in places. But in retrospect, the path becomes clear: winding steadily towards home.The Salt of the Earth, has the power to draw you into its world, transfix, and perhaps eventually transform you.Direct-to-camera testimonials are the movie\\'s troubled heart, and raise the inescapable question of what happens to a soul when it gets to the point where it\\'s simply seen too much.The film is at times too much in awe of its subject, failing to seriously address oft-expressed criticism that Salgado is a voyeur of global pain. But he\\'s willing to get his hands dirty for real change.It is a fascinating film, and if it skimps somewhat on the moral complications of this kind of art, it holds nothing back in terms of volume: Image after image grabs our eye and often grips our throat.This moving, Oscar-nominated documentary is an odyssey of a tragic observer.For this career-spanning documentary, director Wim Wenders accompanies the photographer on his travels, the color documentary footage punctuated by Salgados\\'s stunning, minutely detailed black-and-white images. Gibney makes another attempt to hole and sink [Scientology]. Hooray for him.Gibney boils it down with skill, his cutting, construction, graphics, and score smoothly and seductively encapsulating Scientology\\'s appeal.[Going Clear] doesn\\'t merely peek under the church\\'s zealously maintained guise. It disrobes this controversial religion to reveal an emperor without clothes, an organization that runs on fear and weakness.It\\'s not a sense of outrage that viewers are left with. It\\'s sadness.Chilling, damning stuff.Alex Gibney\\'s film, like Wright\\'s book, is a useful contribution to what looks more and more like an urgent social priority: the push to discourage people from praising the chains that bind them.In which the world\\'s most dauntless documentary-maker takes on the world\\'s most litigious religion (we\\'d call it a cult but we don\\'t want to get sued).Confirms all negative inklings you may have about this purportedly shady organisation.Alas, Alex Gibney\\'s Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief is merely a competent and informative documentary, a snappy collation of everything you\\'ve already heard and read about L Ron Hubbard\\'s dubious money-spinning, ahem, \"religion\".Gibney is too subtle and diligent a film-maker to indulge in a one-sided hatchet-job. The tone of Going Clear is inquisitive, not sensationalist.Even if half of Gibney\\'s film was to be considered tainted, the work of people who have scores to settle, it would be hard to dismiss. They can\\'t all be liars.Gibney ... has a gift for showing the workings of complex social systems, and he lays things out clearly and in a well-aced fashion ...You couldn\\'t call Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief entertaining, exactly, but it is absolutely riveting.While he doesn\\'t really uncover much that\\'s new in \"Going Clear,\" the way he\\'s collected and assembled testimonials, documents and archival footage creates a cumulative effect that\\'s chilling.Whether you come away seeing Scientology as a cult that ensnares vulnerable people or as a faith of self-empowerment, the film leaves a terrible taste of too much information. This must be its point, but take heed just the same.There is order and selection, of course - to say that this is storytelling is not to impugn its parts - but much of what he has to show you is remarkable in or out of this context.Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief... is at times jaw-dropping, scary, unnerving, even disturbingly funny.There is little breaking news in Going Clear, but the film is eye-opening for those who haven\\'t seen past reports.Director Alex Gibney\\'s hauntingly effective Going Clear... suggests only trouble ahead for the frequently criticized and always strange Church of Scientology.If Wright\\'s book was a blistering polemic, then Gibney\\'s film is a great companion piece that shows the human side of a slow-motion tragedy. ...improbably nostalgic, while also offering hope that the communities whose intricate maintenance we once took for granted can be more gratefully reclaimed in the future.Like all Wiseman films, In Jackson Heights is a stealth statement with some political implications.To watch \"In Jackson Heights\" is to feel like you\\'re a part of it.It may be difficult to fully comprehend all the cacophony, but the vibrant hues and collection of characters still make for an interesting sensory experience.Three hours ... some of it brilliant, some tedious ...It may take a village to understand what\\'s going on here, and maybe that\\'s [Wiseman\\'s] point.Wiseman\\'s work takes on the moral density of a Dickens novel. It\\'s smart enough to find the moments that show our civilization, as big and complex and troubled as it is, is still worth fighting for.In Jackson Heights is New York: all of its fears, dreams, hopes and daily concerns rolled up into a relatively (especially for Wiseman) short film.At just over three hours, the nontraditional storytelling of \"In Jackson Heights\" is a challenge. Still, Wiseman\\'s fly-on-the-wall conceit is immersive, even comforting.Much of it is entrancing. But Wiseman\\'s evident fondness for the minutiae of bureaucracy, and for people who make long comments at community meetings, won\\'t be shared by everyone.Whether we\\'re digging in, driving by, spending time with or merely glimpsing, going long or going short, there\\'s not a frame of In Jackson Heights that isn\\'t completely, fully, fascinatingly there.Every frame of it seems delighted by people, delighted by cities, by neighborhoods, delighted by life life itself. It\\'s warm and attentive.This particular parade of context-free anecdotes covers so much different ground that it may be hard for those who\\'ve never been there to believe that they all take place in the same few blocks.As the movie returns to specific spaces, touching on human rights and gentrification along the way, it develops into a deeply stirring ode to the immigrant experience and American identity.In line with its creator\\'s best work, a study of the public life of a place and its people stamped by a rare inquisitive patience.The lightning in the film\\'s bottle isn\\'t some generic feel-good humanism, but a complicated one, fighting for its own existence, sometimes angry, sometimes despondent.Wiseman\\'s very subject is the difference between neighborhood and community-between the happenstance of urban geography and the commitment of self-identification.Light in darkness and darkness in light; for every affirmative moment, Wiseman finds a complementary negative.\"In Jackson Heights\" serves to remind us that our worlds are full of living things, and that, being the social creatures we are, we need each other. The result is exciting but also chilling - an origin story for a long national nightmare.Almost obscenely entertaining.If even these two witty, well-educated, well-mannered men of letters couldn\\'t keep their on-air interactions from degenerating into cheap shots and name-calling, who could?This doc about the 10-night series, directed by Robert Gordon and Morgan Neville (who won an Oscar last year for Twenty Feet From Stardom), provides an entertaining and, ultimately, depressing peek into TV at a pivotal moment.A smart, engrossing documentary about a political and media moment in the United States in the 1960s; a moment whose resonance is topical and whose reverberations have been enduring.What followed [in the debates] was not so much a clash of well-articulated ideas as a clash of highly articulate persons who regarded ideas as ammunition.The details of what went down are fascinating, but the ultimate focus of Best of Enemies is television and this demonstration that it can be both eminently viewable and illuminating.Did anyone win? Most say Vidal, since Buckley descended to physical threats. But really, has anyone won in any of this endless bickering?There is something about the siren call of the TV camera that can turn even big thinkers into brawlers. It was true then and it\\'s true now, and \"Best of Enemies\" serves as a thoroughly enjoyable reminder.For better or for worse, we\\'ll never again see television quite like that documented in the compelling \"Best of Enemies\" ...Like its two subjects, \"Best of Enemies\" is lively and smart. Unlike them, it\\'s even-handed.Best of Enemies offers a bracing view of a pivotal time in our recent history, as Vietnam and race riots scarred a nation\\'s soul, and as the Establishment and the Counter Culture exchanged epithets and blows.New documentary explores the public intellectuals\\' televised spats.It\\'s great television, but it has been available on YouTube for some time now.Vidal vs. Buckley-or, as I prefer to think of it, Alien vs. Predator-has not improved with age. Which combatant you cleave to is beside the point, since both of them teeter on the brink of the insufferable.Best of Enemies leaves you with an overwhelming sense of despair. It\\'s not just a great documentary, it\\'s a vital one.Best of Enemies plays not only as a lively document of an engaging - and insanely entertaining - intellectual rivalry, but as a lament for the very idea of the public intellectual in contemporary life.The film positions those debates as a harbinger of the ideological sword-crossing that has become a staple of TV news. Except what we have now, as opposed to the Vidal-Buckley confrontations, is a lot more yammery than eloquent.Best of Enemies bowls along smartly, with clips from the tapes spiced with intelligently snarky asides from friends and adversaries of the two men, and spliced with archival footage of the tumultuous times they addressed.A timely but unsatisfying exploration of a series of exchanges between conservative Buckley and liberal Vidal makes its case too little and too late. The documentary makes fascinating connections between the fledgling high-showbiz days of rock \\'n\\' roll and the rise of more versatile singer-songwriters in the 1970s.It\\'s a fascinating insight into how a classic song is crafted.Tedesco nails the point: that the beauty of pop music lies not with the prancing pop starlets, but in the hands of the average-looking, insanely talented artists behind the scenes.An entertaining and compelling story about music\\'s unsung heroes.It all feels more like an ambitious home video than a \\'proper\\' film.A must-see for liner-note readers.Good-natured look at the virtuoso workhorses of classic rock and pop.\"The Wrecking Crew\" succeeds as important cultural history. But it\\'s also deeply personal for Tedesco ...It can be uncomfortable to pull back the curtain on some of the most beloved rock songs of all time. Yet, it\\'s worth it in order to meet The Wrecking Crew.Mostly, it\\'s hagiography, with stars like Cher and Brian Wilson used as character witnesses to the players\\' greatness.It\\'ll make you listen to \"Good Vibrations,\" a song you\\'ve heard a million times, with fresh ears.Though their story has taken decades to reach the screen, it has been worth the wait.Denny Tedesco\\'s lively and loving documentary takes its title from the name collectively applied to the group of two to three dozen Los Angeles studio musicians who dominated rock and pop recordings there during the 1960s and early \\'70s.With its release held up for seven years because of rights issues, Denny Tedesco\\'s illuminating documentary about the unsung L.A. session musicians who provided the backbeat for some of the greatest songs from the \\'50s through the \\'80s can now be seen.The studio musicians rarely got credit on or off the albums. In The Wrecking Crew, Denny Tedesco, whose father was a Wrecking Crew guitarist, rights that wrong.The unsung heroes who played on stacks of wax during the \\'60s pop era are celebrated in a hugely entertaining documentary.The Wrecking Crew is a provocative look back at an art form in transition.Fascinating ...Overall, the documentary comes off as a solipsistic, uncritical look at an incredible moment in the history of American music.These unsung heroes are the subject of an illuminating, witty and comprehensive documentary by Denny Tedesco, son of the Crew\\'s inventive guitarist, the late Tommy Tedesco. Observed, even-keeled and well-researched, Welcome to Leith masterfully employs an array of perspectives and insightful news-clips, forming an urgent story which retains a certain objectivity on the offensive racist at its core.As a short sketch of a fading culture, this is fascinating.Welcome to Leith is a sober, terrifying look at the very real monsters roaming the quiet countryside.Indeed, this could be the scariest film of the year.Tense, incisive, and remarkably objective ...Hand it to directors Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K. Walker, who could have made the story into a black-hat/white-hat affair.It\\'s a story about deluded people in a lonely place who are all pretty much missing the point, and on some larger level that describes a whole lot more than one small town besieged by a right-wing kook.The movie serves as an anthropological study of a small town and what happens when a caustic outside force comes barreling in.The directors capture some striking moments, though those sequences often seem more like they belong in a horror feature than a doc ...Mr. Cobb is a truly scary presence whose eyes burn with fervor as he describes his racist, anti-Semitic agenda. At the same time, he is articulate, intelligent, determined and dangerous.[A] fascinating, unnerving documentary.It\\'s easy to make a documentary about hateful people. It\\'s harder to focus on the impact of hateful people on those around them.Nichols and Walker\\'s documentary... demonstrates not only the insidious manner in which Cobb and co. operate on the very edge of legality, but also their toxic effect on a community which ends up crudely mirroring the methods of the enemy within.As horrifying and powerful as any fictional thriller, \"Welcome to Leith\" questions every American\\'s fair use of Constitutional rights and civil liberties, only to have our perceived beliefs and laws shattered.The story of Leith may not be over yet, but viewers will clamor for some kind of resolution, if only to help them sleep at night.As engrossing as a fictional thriller.This new documentary, the latest from Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K Walker, is filmed like a thriller - but the fact that it actually happened is what\\'s most terrifying. Janis: Little Girl Blue vividly and often poignantly revisits her short life -- and hard and fast times.Documentary filmmaker Amy Berg (West of Memphis, Prophet\\'s Prey) has made an elegant, affectionate and, in many ways, remarkably cheerful film about Janis Joplin.It\\'s a wonderful portrait...and it is richly layered.Fine, judicious, generous portrait of a lady who sang the blues.A feast of archive footage and audio recordings takes us on an engrossing journey from folk clubs to rock festival stages, while friends and relatives remember the force of nature that was Joplin with a song between her teeth.\"Baby I know just how you feel,\" she sang. And no one doubted that at all.A soft woman emerges. Her singing voice may have sounded like a soul cut by sandpaper, but her speaking voice was polite and gentle.It traces the arc of Joplin\\'s growth as an artist and gives a hint of the performer she could have become, as she learns to harness the innately feral talent that made her name.Amy J Berg\\'s portrait of Janis Joplin is moving and well researched - a cautionary tale of a rock star cut down in her prime.Janis: Little Girl Blue is a fascinating, flower-powered documentary on the short life and long-lived music of Janis Joplin.She emerges here as a raw and uncompromising talent; her voice tends towards a gravelly roar of rage and need.Despite the gloomy title and the subject\\'s tragic demise, this valuable documentary of incendiary 1960s blues rocker Janis Joplin is actually more celebration than eulogy.Although packed with compelling archive footage, this never quite gets into Joplin\\'s head, heart or soul.Berg tells the story of Janis Joplin with sympathetic straightforwardness in \"Janis: Little Girl Blue,\" and that\\'s fine: Joplin herself provides all the excess.From this pastiche Joplin emerges as we\\'ve never seen her before, articulate, ambitious, torn between her wild self and her desperate need for stability.Smoothly told, with the sweetly vulnerable Joplin letters adding an additional layer of pathos, it\\'s a sad story that leaves us wondering what might have been.Though sluggish in the middle section, the film is nonetheless effective in illustrating how a star as incendiary as Joplin could dim and ultimately die in the spotlight.The director interviewed just about everyone relevant to Joplin\\'s life story who is still alive. She uses archival footage and Joplin\\'s letters - read by singer-songwriter Chan Marshall, a.k.a. Cat Power - to add voices from beyond the grave.This is a meticulously researched film that makes good use of its incredible access.Sweet and wild and vividly alive, she takes a little piece of your heart when she goes. By focusing less on his characters and more on a supposed dark side of Russian hockey, Polsky\\'s film is less documentary than it is didacticism.There\\'s a lesson here for fans of any contemporary sport and an absolutely thrilling tale, impeccably assembled besides. Sporting glory awaits, even for those viewers who couldn\\'t tell a jockstrap from a jellybean.Polsky\\'s documentary is nominally about ice hockey, but culture and politics provide the driving force as the Russians go head to head with the Americans in a battle of ideology, economics and art.The interviews are as entertaining as the slick interplay on the ice.Who knew that a documentary on the Soviet Union\\'s Red Army ice hockey team would be so gripping and provide a perfect microcosm of the stages of the Cold War, Perestroika and Putin\\'s reign?A fascinating and touching tale.A moving and endlessly interesting portrait of the Soviet team and its many travails.Fascinating, funny, heroic, moving and may even make hockey fans out of nonbelievers.It\\'s a mark of Polsky\\'s ambition and canniness that he braids hockey not just with geopolitics but also with personal history and human drama.Polsky keeps things lively, both visually and with his editing. But the sometimes-lighthearted approach never undermines the serious business at hand.On the surface it\\'s the story of one particular hockey player, but it reflects so much more.It\\'s a story of global consequences and historic proportions, and of astounding athleticism and synchronicity - and filmmaker Polsky ices it.Wittily edited and beautifully scored, \"Red Army\" is not just a terrific film but an important one - even if you don\\'t give two hoots about ice hockey.Sports, and hockey in particular, were a propaganda tool for the communist system, which is richly illustrated here in archival footage and poster art.This engaging documentary provocatively suggests that the team succeeded in large part because of communist indoctrination.An easy-to-digest history lesson that still reverberates on today\\'s geopolitical landscape. As they say in hockey, Polsky pulls off a hat trick.Polsky winds up being as canny a storyteller as his subject - whom he gratifyingly and hilariously prevents from having the last word.Audiences knowing nothing about hockey will still be able to appreciate this movie as a somewhat jaunty take on the cold war and its aftermath - and resurgence.Red Army is Gabe Polsky\\'s compelling but skewed documentary on the Soviets\\' less-than-sporting mentality when it came to the international skating and puck-shooting game.No need to be a sports fan to become enthralled with \"Red Army.\" The documentary held me in its grip from start to finish. The Hunting Ground succeeds as a damning portrait of how colleges have allowed sexual assault to go unchecked, valuing their own reputations over the lives of vulnerable students.Stunning, powerful, infuriating.An important film to see for parents, students and anyone involved with academia.Important but devastating viewing.When and where your frustration and anger boil over while watching \"The Hunting Ground\" is an individual experience, one that will be different for everyone who sees it.The Hunting Ground qualifies as activist filmmaking. More power to it. You can read all the statistics you want, but there\\'s no substitute for bearing witness - especially in such overwhelming numbers.The Hunting Ground is a clear piece of survivors\\' advocacy. Dick\\'s purpose is not to be fair to both sides. But is that such a problem when no one has been fair to his subjects?The Hunting Ground is, by its very nature, rough going for the viewer, but how else should it be?The Hunting Ground finds a narrative spine in the story of two rape victims: Andrea Pino and Annie E. Clark, students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who wound up launching their own grassroots investigation into the epidemic.The documentary makes a persuasive case that certain colleges and universities -- which are called out onscreen -- foster a culture that punishes victims and protects serial predators.From its first moments, the new documentary \"The Hunting Ground\" instills a sense of dread that is very, very tough to shake.Though far from a perfect film, The Hunting Ground is a significant piece of advocacy journalism that shows young women refusing to be mute about crimes that have been commited against them.\"?√á√®\\'71\" succeeds as an action thriller, but with enough complexity to keep the brain engaged. The film is also a reminder of the byproducts of hatred.As a call to action, \"The Hunting Ground\" truly goes to bat for rape survivors. As a documentary, the movie as a whole is much lesser than its individual parts.The movie needs to be seen and discussed by everyone within shouting distance of the college experience: parents, students (of both genders), administrators, alumni, coaches - the list goes on.The Hunting Ground explores its disturbing subject so thoroughly that the documentary feels more like a horror film - a slasher movie where the psyches of its young, smart victims are in tatters.The Hunting Ground\\'s most unsettling finding is widespread institutional tolerance of campus rapists, because school administrators fear bad publicity and the loss of alumni cash endowments.It\\'s uncomfortable viewing. But scrupulously researched and movingly told.There\\'s a dicey feeling of familiarity to Dick\\'s new film, a sense of footage fitting into pre-existing slots ... Instead of putting a human face on appalling statistics, the faces are starting to look like just more quantifiable evidenceThe film stokes outrage, sometimes shamelessly, but it\\'s righteous outrage. This is a rapturous, unsettling movie about beauty, mystery, and unimaginable horror.This documentary holds every card in the pack, from geology to anthropology to the history of tribes and tyrants, and plays them like a master.This haunting Chilean documentary is more poetry than journalism as filmmaker Patricio Guzman compares the fate of the indigenous people of Patagonia with that of the disappeared of the Pinochet regime.As always, Guzm?√≠n unearths details that establish resonant connections between diverse worlds (the \"pearl button\" of the title proves typically allusive) but at a brief 82 minutes this feels like too many streams gathering in one overcrowded pool.The Pearl Button is a piece of visual poetry that meanders along the waterways, coastline and history of Chile, coming into sharp and horrifying focus on the atrocities of Augusto Pinochet\\'s dictatorship.Patricio Guzm?√≠n\\'s essay-style documentary is a deceptive but very moving affair.A sobering, lyrical essay film on Chile\\'s various physical and emotional surface areas.Despite the striking photography, this fascinating denunciation of 150 years of persecution and oppression lacks Guzm?√≠n\\'s customary trenchancy and restraint.If, as the poet Ra??l Zurita testifies, the process of returning the dead is about allowing the living to grieve, The Pearl Button is ultimately about cinema\\'s unique way of retelling the past.Guzm?√≠n\\'s reputation as one of the great documentarians will only be enhanced by The Pearl Button. It really is intelligent, magnificent film-making.We get a hint that Guzm?√≠n is trying to find resonances where none naturally exist.Another philosophical and cosmic historical documentary.This is history of a personalized and meditative sort, and you ought to give it a chance.By turns lyrical, impressionistic and profound, the documentary \"The Pearl Button\" requires patience but offers stirring rewards.Ultimately, the material starts to feel thin, with Guzm?√≠n attempting to cover everything in less than 90 minutes.Patricio Guzman, who chronicled the military coup against Salvador Allende in his documentary trilogy The Battle of Chile, has begun, in old age, to process his political experiences through stunning personal essay films.As often happens in Guzm?√≠n\\'s films, \"The Pearl Button\" keeps returning to the Augusto Pinochet dictatorship of 1973-90, during which thousands of Chileans were \"disappeared,\" taken away and never seen again alive.Dealing with horrors of this intensity and scale, Guzm?√≠n can be forgiven a slight penchant for the galactically vaporous....there is so much in this film, so many thoughtful, inspiring and tragic ideas about water and stars and memory and music...[Guzman] introspection finds a kind of justice through poetry, and shows how memory must always be a continuing process. All in all, this is one of Disneynature\\'s best in-country outings so far, so much so that you\\'re very likely to leave the theatre feeling downright giddy and more connected to the world than before.This may be an unabashed, Disneyfied version of nature. But it\\'s also fun, touching, and expertly assembled.You\\'re likely to laugh and learn in equal measure-and so will your little ones.An enjoyable documentary, with some painless lessons. And a good heart, too ...Adorable as expected but also surprisingly absorbing, with marvelous narration from Tina Fey.The story of the colony\\'s exile and return feels like a dull sermon, but the animals themselves, with their expressive faces and Moe Howard hairdos, can switch from slapstick to pathos faster than Charlie Chaplin.\"Monkey Kingdom\" clocks in at a very digestible 82 minutes and doesn\\'t overstay its welcome. It doesn\\'t monkey around - that\\'s left to the film\\'s subjects, who are more than happy to oblige.Stick around for the credits to find out how pivotal scenes were shot for this worthy addition to Disney\\'s long tradition of nature family films.The film offers a valuable life lesson in the powers of determination and timing, but most of all it\\'s darned entertaining.You know how nature docs work. You forgive the hoked-up comic relief ... and tasteful allusions to death and dying and procreation because the tight shots of Maya\\'s lil\\' Kip are so durn cuuuuute.It\\'s been clear for awhile now that Tina Fey rules. \"Monkey Kingdom\" is just the latest entertainment to benefit.As much fun as a tree full of toque macaques, Monkey Kingdom is arguably the most entertaining of Disneynature\\'s eight features.It\\'s hard to imagine what message children will take away from this film other than that monkeys are just like characters in a fictional Disney movie, which they are not.Monkeys.Monkey Kingdom may be Disneynature\\'s low point thus far, but that doesn\\'t mean it isn\\'t a great time.Although its chief asset is its inherently entertaining subject matter, \"Monkey Kingdom\" does far more than just let the cameras roll: It teases a compelling drama out of one monkey tribe\\'s complicated social hierarchy ...\"Monkey Kingdom\" tugs our heartstrings to the top of the trees. With a lot of patience, and perhaps a little trickery, directors Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill have produced a simian \"Cinderella.\"If you don\\'t love monkeys already - and really, we all should - then \"Monkey Kingdom\" will swing you in the right direction.You couldn\\'t do much better than \"Monkey Kingdom\" to get kids invested in learning about, and protecting, the natural world.Monkey Kingdom is delightful, and its swinging and vaulting best any stuntwork you\\'ll see in this year\\'s summer blockbusters ... If you\\'re doing general research on the Panthers and a need resource, or interested in learning more about their story (from a male perspective only), THE BLACK PANTHERS: VANGUARD OF THE REVOLUTION is definitely for you.Stick with this movie. It has a lot to say, a lot to reveal and is pertinent to today\\'s testy police/civilian race relations.Vanguard of the Revolution is at its strongest when it entertains female voices: Elaine Brown, Kathleen Cleaver, Ericka Huggins. Their fire is vigorously undimmed.A pulsing soul-power soundtrack, extensive and rare archive footage and fiercely honest contemporary interviews drive Stanley Nelson\\'s blistering account of the rise and fall of the Black Panther party.Combining archive footage and present-day interviews, and using music to drive the story, Nelson tells a complicated and often violent story in lithe, inventive fashion.Conventional as a documentary, but speaks about much more than the just the subject at hand.It might have benefited from a more critical polemic (some of those Panther cats, I believe, weren\\'t all good), but for an analysis of US racial dynamics as seen from the post #ICantBreathe era, it makes for sobering viewing.Why are the Black Panthers not a force today? Has radicalism collapsed? An engrossing return to a forgotten past.The film doesn\\'t shake our suspicion that the stories being told have calcified into legend.Exploring activism\\'s role in the \\'60s struggle for civil rights, this is a powerful look at a contentiously iconic movement.\"The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution\" arrives on PBS stations early next year. I suggest not waiting.The documentary connects the past and the present so forcefully that we see our own reflection in the struggle to bring power to the people.Nelson understands the play of outsized personalities and unexpected events, and he\\'s helped that enough time has passed for former Panthers to feel comfortable telling their stories, especially to someone of Nelson\\'s stature in the documentary world.[A] straightforward, liberal-minded history of the Black Panther Party.If \"The Black Panthers\" has been designed to leave viewers outraged and energized in equal measure, it succeeds with admirable style. It counts both as essential history and a primer in making sense of how we live now.A brisk, balanced mix of interviews, archival footage, and photos backed by a pointed soundtrack ...Half a century later, the Panther movement could find a renaissance in a situation that seems not all that different. Things change, but in many ways they stay the same, and you\\'ll wish the film just didn\\'t have to be so timely.\"The Black Panthers: Vanguard of the Revolution\" is not a particularly exceptional movie in form, but as a thorough record it is extraordinary.An impressively detailed explication of how quickly the Black Panthers rose and fell.[An] intelligent, admiring documentary about the legendary political group, a sprawling narrative that inevitably leaves some threads dangling. You may find \"Sunshine Superman\" exhilarating or you may find \"Sunshine Superman\" terrifying, but you almost surely will not find it boring.Sunshine Superman is at times a bit too reverent with the material, and there are distracting reenactments ( la The Jinx and Man on Wire), some of which seem extraneous, but overall, the film is a sun-kissed tribute to a singular individual.Engrossing, tension-filled and utterly fascinating.While the doc takes a conventional and even pedestrian approach -- with multiple talking-head interviews and some re-enactments with actors -- there is also plenty of spectacular archival footage showing jumps dating back to the 1960s.[A] spectacular and affecting portrait.Long before there were GoPros, there was Boenish, a camera mounted on his helmet, jumping from Yosemite\\'s El Capitan or L.A. skyscrapers under construction.A generally splendid documentary by Marah Strauch about people throwing themselves off cliffs. Literally.Boenish\\'s wife, Jean, who trained to jump with him, is interviewed extensively, and, although Strauch doesn\\'t provide much backstory for her, she emerges as that rarity -- a perfect matchup to a seemingly unmatchable man.Sunshine Superman, named for the Donovan song, is about more than just Boenish. It\\'s about the power of the image, something that Strauch uses to great effect.The result is as much the portrait of a marriage as it is history of a sport and its founder, and if it occasionally feels repetitive or murky, its moments of magnificence remain undimmed.The action shots are intoxicating, as close as most of us will get to feeling the jumpers\\' euphoria.The real-life stunts are eminently suspenseful and exhilarating, and adrenaline junkies will be well pleased. For the uninitiated, however, Strauch\\'s adoring treatment of the Boenishes may be a little hard to stomach.[A] gripping documentary.\"Sunshine Superman\" might seem like a niche story, with its focus on stunts that most people wouldn\\'t dream of actually doing, but the documentary feels universal. It\\'s simply an examination of how one man fully embraced life while charting his own path.Strauch makes a compelling case for the exhilaration of living, and dying, on your own terms, a freedom so few of us ever truly experience.The subject matter increasingly suggests a kind of cross between \"Man On Wire\" and \"Grizzly Man,\" but unlike \"Grizzly Man\" director Werner Herzog, director Strauch has little interrogative spirit. There\\'s no interest in exploring Boenish\\'s contradictions....the existential angle of Boenish\\'s story (as well as the unbeatable footage) elevates Sunshine Superman to a greater height.A bittersweet documentary about Carl Boenish, who looked at very tall things and saw an opportunity to leap.Director Marah Strauch gives the film an exhilarating uplift of its own.The film, like its subject and everyone who talks about him, is frustratingly short on analysis or insight. Heineman goes through the gates of Hell and comes back empty-handed.Horribly real, an urgent and alarming account of a crisis so hellishly labyrinthine it\\'s hard to see how anyone can escape its widening web of violence, extortion and corruption.Matthew Heineman\\'s documentary about the Mexican drug wars plays like a real-life version of some grim Sam Peckinpah Western in which violence and corruption have become endemic.The road to hell, as paved with best intentions, has never looked better.Thoroughly researched, occasionally engrossing, but ultimately frustrating.There\\'s no doubting Heineman and his crew\\'s audacity as they venture close to the line of fire, but the commitment to observing dispassionately at all times starts to feel a bit like a cop-out.There are scenes here unlike anything you\\'ve seen. Timely, thoughtful and supremely well-constructed, we\\'d be stunned if this isn\\'t the doc to beat on Oscar night.This raw and compelling (if necessarily incomplete) documentary focuses on the recent battles between drug cartels and vigilantes along the Arizona-Mexico border.Even if it leaves you wanting more, \"Cartel Land\" deserves to be seen.Much of the documentary Cartel Land, an immersion into the Mexican drug traffickers and citizen vigilantes, is hair-raisingly intense.One of the year\\'s most important documentaries ...By the end of Heineman\\'s rattling 98 minutes, the war on drugs seems more than ever like a war destined to go on forever before being lost on every side.As the film demonstrates, this is far from a black-and-white situation.Although the film has its shortcomings and simplifications, it\\'s a bleakly persuasive view of a decades-long combat that respects no boundaries, and seems to hold no prospect of surcease.A jaw-dropping documentary about two vigilante groups, on opposite sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, trying to stave off Mexican drug cartels.If the key to price in real estate is \"location, location, location,\" the key to success in v??rit??-style documentaries is \"access, access, access.\" Which is what \"Cartel Land\" has in compelling amounts.Cartel Land offers a chilling glimpse into a world of violence and vigilantism.A worthwhile report on a pressing humanitarian issue.It\\'s one thing to invent a vigilante drama as darkly perfect as this, it\\'s another to capture it as it actually unfolds.Some documentaries are about answers. Others are about questions. \"Cartel Land\" is about the hazy territory in between ... It\\'s a fabulously entertaining view from inside a political campaign, giving us a firsthand experience of all the weird, Good Wife-style maneuvering that takes place.What Weiner makes painfully clear is the collateral damage of Weiner\\'s actions... To that extent, it\\'s possible to share his politics and still see him as a fatally flawed vessel for them.Weiner shows, without embellishment, without cinematic sleight of hand, that a person\\'s worst enemy remains themselves.In the end, it\\'s hard to tell if his downfall is due to blind egotism or suicidal optimism.Edited to perfection, this is like watching the slow-motion footage of a building collapsing.The facts of the case are outlandish enough, but what\\'s even more eye-opening is that so much of it has been documented in real time by directors Josh Kriegman and Elyse Steinberg.This extraordinary chronicle, characterised by extraordinary access and dozens of \"No, really?\" moments, offers a terrifying and cautionary tale of political hubris.Weiner doesn\\'t try to push the filmmakers away once the scandal breaks. They respond by treating their subject in an even-handed way.Horribly compulsive viewing ...You will often have to watch through your fingers, so cringe inducing are some of the scenes.The sheer unlikeliness of a politician sharing a name with a slang term for the organ of his undoing reflects the sheer unlikeliness of almost every twist and turn in this fly-on-the-wall thrill ride.A case study in blunt-force media trauma.An astounding chronicle of hubris.Ridiculously entertaining.[A] fascinating documentary about a disgraced politician trying to claw his way back into the public\\'s good graces, the media\\'s obsession with titillation and confrontation, and a marriage seemingly near collapse under the shock of scandal.A can\\'t-look-away documentary about the trainwreck 2013 mayoral run of her husband, Anthony Weiner.Easily escapes the fading headlines about a botched campaign to become an enduring portrait of a political animal caught in a technological trap.\"Weiner\" is a thorough examination of modern politics, the 24-hour news cycle and the grind of the campaign trail.The result is a fascinating portrait of a politician - a man who, it seems, doesn\\'t feel that he exists unless someone\\'s looking at him.It\\'s a movie from which you can\\'t look away, no matter how hard you may try. An autobiography of sorts, Cameraperson demands we think beyond Johnson\\'s own extraordinary career and reflect upon our own status as observers, and the ethical and emotional responsibilities that come with it.Cameraperson is at its best when it captures instances of unexpected life.A life behind the lens is examined in \"Cameraperson,\" a fascinating, purposely disjointed documentary from director Kirsten Johnson.Watching Cameraperson, we take Johnson\\'s rich images into ourselves. Having watched them, experienced them, they become entangled with us, too.Although we only see Johnson\\'s face once, briefly, it\\'s a detailed self-portrait of an extraordinary woman.Cameraperson is haunted - as one senses Johnson may be - by the question of whether and how much documentary filmmakers should intervene in the lives of their subjects.Cameraperson\\'s scrapbook of outtakes and downtime surpasses any of Johnson\\'s greatest hits.Kirsten Johnson has created a resonant and revealing kaleidoscope of her life behind the camera on films from Bosnian war documentaries to the Edward Snowden film Citizenfour and even a portrait of the philosopher Jacques Derrida.Cameraperson is an absorbing, challenging creation.A thoughtful examination of the role of the documentary-maker.Put briefly, [Johnson] earns her juxtapositions of wildflowers and barbed wire.\"Cameraperson\" shows us the power of image as a tool of recording life, but also finds reasons that even in the worst situations, it\\'s still worth living.Cameraperson draws our attention not just to what we\\'re seeing, but to how we\\'re seeing it. It encourages us to wonder how a camera operator negotiates personal space in tense, intimate, emotionally fraught situations.A labor of love of the highest order.Though much of the material in Cameraperson is old, Johnson has undeniably created something new.Cameraperson is not merely a grab bag of images. It pulls double duty as a theoretical essay on the cinematic apparatus itself.Cameraperson summons us to really think about a world that is more connected than we may realize.Personal footage of Johnson\\'s family and friends, woven into the documentary scenes, enhances the sense that any life is a series of amazements.\"Cameraperson\" testifies to a world in which it would be clear to see that we\\'re all connected, if only we took the time to look at one another with reverence and simply listen.\"Cameraperson\" is a documentary unlike any other. The overall absurdity of the piece left me numb beyond belief. Why stop here? Why not a claymation recreation of the events of 9-11? Or Jiminy Cricket in Steven Spielberg\\'s When You Wish Upon Auschwitz?[The rotoscope technique] gives it urgency and a sense of movement.This movie is very smart about when it unpacks its interviews versus its recreations. It does it in such a way that I was emotionally flooded.The sheer beauty of the images gives Tower a surreal quality and drenches it in emotion.A gripping examination of human bravery and frailty in the face of barbarity.Tower is a vivid snapshot of derangement, heroism, endurance and sometimes admitted cowardice on what remains the most traumatic day in University of Texas history.A haunting re-creation of a first-of-its-kind tragedy. Fifty years later, it seems, we\\'re no closer to answers or solutions.No matter how many years later, no matter how cool your animation technique might be, \"Nobody\" somehow feels like the wrong answer to that question.Deftly combining archive footage, interviews and handsome rotoscoped animation, Tower is an innovative documentary account of the mass shootings on the University of Texas campus on 1 August 1966.The film stands as a powerful, emotional memorial.Search the film out. It\\'s worth the seeking.This is a morbid but very original film which manages both to be reflective and dramatic.\"Tower\" is, in a sense, about the last day of this country\\'s innocence, or whatever was left of it after Dallas, 1963.Despite the grim topic, Tower offers moments of genuine hope in the acts of bravery and kindness that took place during the siege.The result is a remarkable film that deserves an Academy Award nomination for best documentary.Easily one of the best films of the year ...It brings the terror of those 90 minutes on a sizzling 100-degree August day to vivid life.Tower manages to collapse the space between past and present, which, given the timeliness of the subject matter, has a haunting effect.Maitland has created a documentary with a remarkable you-are-there immediacy.I rarely, if ever, use the cliche \"a must-see movie,\" but in this case it\\'s entirely apropos. In her documentary, 13th, Ava DuVernay cites the wording of the 13th amendment, which outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude \"except as a punishment for crime...\" but DuVernay gives the argument enormous cinematic force.DuVernay creates a cogent, compelling argument in 13th, which balances attractively filmed talking-head interviews with alternately heartbreaking and infuriating archival footage.What [DuVernay] achives in a relatively short amount of time... feels thorough and yet concise and it\\'s calmly powerful.The urgency that courses through this documentary is that things actually can change if knowledge can be turned into momentum and momentum can become legislation.13th doesn\\'t tell you anything you didn\\'t already know if you\\'ve been paying attention. Its triumph is to fit the pieces together, to make visible the pattern that was there all along.This doc is a calm, articulate, well-reasoned wail of anguish.13th tells us black Americans are not irrational. They are not making up racism or targeted arrests and police violence. 13th tells us black people are not crazy.What the film does beautifully, is its connecting of a thread that runs through the past one hundred and fifty years; we did not come to this place in history by accident.[DuVernay\\'s] movie, for all its good words and bad pictures, lacks the fierce urgency of now.The latest film from acclaimed Selma director Ava DuVernay is a much-needed, sobering punch to the face that eloquently contextualizes the current state of America and one of its most important issues.It\\'s a crazy amount of ground to cover, but only rarely does 13th sacrifice clarity for cinematic energy.In its sweeping treatment of the history of American racism, the film brought me closer than I\\'ve ever been to understanding how it could be that so many people could have ever grown used to the moral catastrophes that were slavery and Jim Crow.Given the concerns about relations between law enforcement and minority communities, 13th could hardly be timelier.It\\'s all very alarming and upsetting and terrifying.Manages to capture the depth and insidiousness of more than a century of cultural, societal and economic oppression along racial lines and then condenses it into a brisk 100-minute package that could literally slip right into your pocket.The film is a revelation on so many levels. When it ends, the feeling of anger and sorrow is almost overwhelming.The documentary teems with facts and archive footage. The mass of information can be intimidating, but the argumentation is well-constructed.13th ... is dense with information, and it moves fast. But it\\'s also a story told in images, and the ones DuVernay has chosen ring not just with sadness and horror but also cautious optimism.At once devastating, infuriating and bracing, 13th is a landmark documentary that mourns the martyrs and provides a prcis of how to make America truly just.The words are so piercing and acute that we hardly need the stirring score that swirls in the background. Unearthed fan footage and gorgeously restored concert clips make this a must-see for Beatles fans.Howard assembles Eight Days a Week with an eye to appeasing those knowledgeable about Beatles history.The songs are still great. The foursome\\'s waggish chemistry is still a wonder. But there\\'s a lot of old ground, even old grind.The material is uncontroversial to say the least, but hugely enjoyable with some remastered live performances that were previously drowned out by screaming girl fans.If you\\'re a Beatles fan - and that\\'s who a movie like this is for - you\\'ve already seen most of this stuff, and diehards (and I speak as one myself) will probably find themselves focusing more on Howard\\'s stranger choices.[Howard seems] as if he were intent on making a film for anyone who tuned in to The Ed Sullivan Show in 1964, fell in love with the four adorable mop tops and regrets all the long-haired plonking about with sitars that came later.For those of us who can remember, it\\'s a deliriously evocative nostalgia trip, as well as a timely reminder of more spontaneous times.The Beatles now belong to an honored past, stuck there like an obelisk, and yet here they are, alive-busting out all over, time and time again. Yeah, yeah, yeah.A triumph of deft editing and extraordinary access, this is likely to be the most important music documentary of the year.Beatles fans will relish this musically rich trip down memory lane, while even the uninitiated will surely be impressed by the talent, humour and, yes, class on display.What makes the film magical is the sheer richness of the archive material and the pace at which it has been edited. The documentary never feels like an exercise in nostalgia.90 percent familiar and a bit hagiographic as well, but just try watching it without smiling.Ron Howard\\'s documentary rightly keeps coming back to the music and the band\\'s delight in making it. Good move. It truly is a joy forever.Don\\'t expect trenchant analysis or deep insights into the group\\'s creative process. Do revel, however, in the gleeful tumult and the gorgeous music.It all feels a little glossy, but who can complain when the vibes are so good and the tunes so catchy?The music is so strong, and such a demonstration of how potent the group was in action, that it alone makes the film worth seeing.Howard is more interested in wowing audiences with exuberant, hysteria-ridden performances than he is in digging for explanations.The familiar events presented here were covered more thoroughly in the band\\'s own 11-hour Beatles Anthology, though Howard has dug up some good ancillary concert footage that illustrates the chaos swirling around every show.As someone who\\'s been a fan since 5, twisting away in my living room to their Ed Sullivan appearance, there isn\\'t much I haven\\'t seen. Or thought I hadn\\'t. But Howard still digs up surprises ...I\\'ve heard \"Rubber Soul\" and \"Revolver\" and \"Sgt. Pepper\\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band\" probably thousands of times, too, and I still like hearing them. So it is with Howard\\'s movie - the story is so incredibly good, it\\'s worth repeating. Steve Hoover\\'s film makes for a sympathetic,yet quietly critical portrait. John Pope\\'s dark lensing and Atticus Ross\\'s score add to the sense of unease and intrigue.Almost Holy is a deeply disturbing and shocking documentary portrait of life at its lowest ebb.This gripping documentary about Gennadiy Mokhnenko, aka Pastor Crocodile, a controversial child-welfare activist in Ukraine, has the propulsive power and arc of a drama.A telling scene where he gets worked up about the \"criticism\" of him on his Wikipedia page hints at a darker side to his character, and he doesn\\'t take kindly to a journalist querying his vigilante methods.The doc is maybe a little one-sided, but it\\'s fascinating.This is a film that challenges us to accept a flawed protagonist. His faults do not negate his charitable work, but it is up to us to decide whether they make him less of a hero.Steve Hoover peels back multiple layers of Mokhnenko\\'s story with artistry and acuity, assisted by a heady and propulsive score from composer Atticus Ross.Director Hoover utilizes some tricky spot-focus to draw the audience in, and the grim yet entirely appropriate score by Atticus Ross provides a perfect complement to the events unfolding onscreen.This documentary isn\\'t about heroes and villains, or determining right and wrong. It\\'s about hope in the face of hopelessness, and what drives a man to keep trying to change the seemingly unchangeable.Vital viewing.To the filmmakers, Pastor Gennadiy Mokhnenko is a bit of a superhero. I found myself leaning that way too.\"Almost Holy\" captures something meaningfully urgent in the brutal day-to-day of tough love amid a world of tougher indifference.A good example of how a charismatic figure doesn\\'t automatically generate a deep or compelling documentary ...Almost Holy has the feel of following an embedded journalist on one of those raw, ground-level views of a problem you\\'d never considered before but now, by virtue of good reporting, feels urgent and alive.Steve Hoover\\'s documentary affords one an unusually intimate glance at the collapsed infrastructure of the former Soviet Union.Hoover\\'s style seems equally fit for a bleak documentary, suspenseful thriller, black comedy, dystopian sci-fi nightmare and grisly horror film.Steve Hoover\\'s outraged documentary follows pastor Gennadiy Mokhnenko, a furiously committed intervener who drags drug-addicted kids into clinics and confronts the pharmacists who sell them codeine.The best superhero vigilante movie of the year.Steve Hoover\\'s documentary boasts a colorful and controversial subject, who strides through the squalor to an Atticus Ross score.A powerful, meaty documentary. ... by getting Iggy to talk about his art rather than his antics, Jarmusch performs the delicate feat of elucidating a beloved rock\\'n\\'roll persona without exploding it.Iggy is the star of the show. He comes across, still lean and long-haired and handsome (and almost fully clothed), as intelligent, caring -- and still vexed by what he sees as the corporate corruption of rock \\'n\\' roll in the 70s.Without breaking many rules, Gimme Danger honours these admirable rule-breakers.The director is a little too thrilled to be in the room with his hero, and real revelation is scarce. Still, we get that mega-clang.On balance, this is mostly for fans -- and even they may feel some of the mixed emotions that arise whenever a one-time rebel is ushered into the hall of fame.With this punchy documentary, Jim Jarmusch makes a fairly persuasive case that the Stooges, fronted by snake-hipped rock legend Iggy Pop, were the greatest band of all time.Gimme Danger is a gross act of fandom masquerading as a musical documentary.Jim Jarmusch\\'s film about Iggy Pop and the Stooges has all the familiar ingredients but Jarmusch is an accomplished enough director to move the material onto another plane.Unwholesome rock\\'n\\'roll excitement.Iggy\\'s survival means he\\'s the film\\'s anchor, and it\\'s his captivating storytelling, full of both articulate reminiscences and daft flights of deranged fancy, that helps to overlook the film\\'s overall lack of weight ...An important addition to our understanding of early \\'70s anarchy.Both fans and newcomers to the Stooges will leave with the hairs on their inner ears singed (thanks partly to the film\\'s particularly forceful sound design) and a song in their heart, even if that song is \"Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell.\"The Stooges\\' story is a natural fit for the silver screen. Unfortunately, superfan Jim Jarmusch\\'s love letter to them does not quite do it justice.Chronologically charts the chaotic rise, fall and reunion of shirtless Iggy Pop and his grungy, volatile crew of iconoclastic Michigan punks who wowed the critics but disappointed the record companies.A brainy and funny look at the creation and still-evolving legacy of a rock \\'n\\' roll band Jarmusch considers the greatest of all time, even if RollingStone and snobby critics won\\'t admit it.Those who know every shred of the band\\'s story will find the film a cool reminder of what the Stooges meant to rock \\'n\\' roll. Those who know little of their music will find Pop an interesting and forthcoming individual.Iggy Pop, the band\\'s front man and the only member to graduate to a solo career, is a source of endless hilarity as he recalls the band\\'s grungy beginnings and lurching journey through the music business.Gimme Danger is more than carried by the colourfulness of its story and characters, and by the bold essay-like thesis that The Stooges -- now firmly ensconced in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame -- were the greatest rock band of all time.Jarmusch\\'s use of stock footage and snippets of old movies provides perfect backup for the personification of punk nihilism.Against the steepest of odds, Iggy survives. Nearing 70, he looks healthier than ever, as if everything we know is wrong and wretched excess guarantees longevity. Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow are the co-directors of De Palma, a scrumptious documentary about the creator of Carrie and Scarface.De Palma\\'s work is explored in his own words, and his words only, uncluttered by talking heads and critical evaluations. And frankly, De Palma is such an entertaining and open raconteur, his words are all you need.The documentary convinces us of De Palma\\'s logistical and visual flair -- his ability to choreograph astonishingly elaborate sequences and his pioneering use of Steadicam.This is a very entertaining guide.Riveting and highly entertaining.It\\'s this frankness, free of artifice, devoid of a censor, that makes this documentary what it is.Paltrow and Baumbach simply walk De Palma through his filmography and collect his best stories. But this systematic approach has a nice leveling effect in that his more obscure, offbeat projects get as much attention as his signature films.Since so many of De Palma\\'s films have become part and parcel with the American cultural consciousness of the last 50 years, I can\\'t imagine this filmmaker\\'s insights not providing every viewer with some memorable takeaways.De Palma is a deceptively simple documentary film: Director Brian De Palma sits in front of a fireplace for nearly two hours and talks about his life and career. If you love movies, it\\'s time well spent.A trip through his wild and hugely influential filmography is mandatory for any film fan, and that\\'s just what directors Noah Baumbach and Jake Paltrow offer in their new documentary.Immersive and illuminating ...He could go on for days with his war stories, and the doc makes you wish he would.\"De Palma\" is a cinematic sampler that makes you want to gorge on the whole unholy buffet.De Palma enthusiasts will benefit the most here (small surprise), but there\\'s good material for anyone interested in how their cinematic sausage gets made.An engaging if superficial sit, not just for his fans but also for anyone who seeks to understand cinematic grammar and the often un-pretty process of how movies get made.\"De Palma\" deftly covers the full gamut of the man\\'s films, from the early Robert De Niro collaboration \"The Wedding Party\" (shot in 1963) through commercial breakthroughs in the 1970s and then several more career ups and downs afterward.If you love movies, it\\'s time well spent.He\\'s allowed to ruminate, largely, and what\\'s revealed is an artist impulsively self-reflective, whatever side of the camera he\\'s on.None of this will win over the De Palma haters, but they are clearly outside the intended audience here.The documentary\\'s commitment to being thorough is admirable. But that urge to be comprehensive is also how De Palma shoots itself in the foot. The funny, sad Dark Horse adds a creepy loser in love to the director\\'s catalog of misanthropes.It\\'s a true winner and a genuine crowdpleaser, a human story told well through one incredible animal.Fantasy fulfillment for those wondering what would happen if Ma & Pa Kettle hauled Mr. Ed to Del Mar and pulled up a stall adjacent to the high-hatted muckety mucks.It\\'s a galloping victory.Oh, just try to resist this one.It\\'s an old-fashioned tale of an individual overcoming the odds - only in this case, that individual happens to be a horse.Americans seem uncommonly uncomfortable discussing our own class struggles. But, boy, do we love to watch the Brits do it. I think that\\'s one reason the inspiring and joyful Dark Horse is such an appealing film.A remarkable tale about ordinary people, and Osmond keeps it simple with her conventional style and good-natured manipulation.Regardless of whether Dream Alliance wins, places, or shows, he and this lovely film are, without question, a sure bet.An inspiring tale heard, as it were, straight from the horse\\'s mouth.Osmond may tell the story to wring maximum emotion out of the audience, but so what? Isn\\'t that why people make these movies? It is. And more importantly, it\\'s why people watch them.Osmond reaches for political relevance [but] it seems peripheral to the investors\\' agenda of patting themselves on the back.At times, the documentary\\'s unhurried pace verges on the slow. Ultimately, though, it is such a feel-good story that it\\'s best not to rush things.Who can resist a good horse story?Louise Osmond\\'s \"Dark Horse\" is a slight but winning documentary about a most unlikely event, and I hope Hollywood doesn\\'t get wind of it.It would be hard for any fictional treatment to beat the pleasures of Osmond\\'s genial, enthralling documentary.It\\'s true that Dark Horse relies a bit too heavily on commercial race footage. Yet the movie grows into uplift of a whole other kind.Unfolding with a sincerity that dares you to roll your eyes, this warmhearted documentary by Louise Osmond wallows in its working-class roots like a horse in clover.The special appeal of \"Dark Horse\" is that it\\'s about many more things, all of them fascinating, than its starting point would suggest.[A] crowd-pleasing documentary ... It is an intimate tale of triumphs and setbacks, but also a story of tremendous consequence.Editor David Teague skilfully places original animated inserts and favourite movie scenes to allow us a brief glimpse into Owen\\'s wonderful Disneyfied psyche.Life, Animated, directed by Roger Ross Williams, is a touching documentary about autism.This documentary, through expressive sound design, appealing animation and Owen\\'s observations, gives real insight into the mind of an autistic person.A wonderful example of the power of cinema and humanity.Particularly vivid and endearing.Director Roger Ross Williams\\'s immensely rewarding documentary tells the story of the Suskind family and shows how love, sensitive parenting and watching tons of kids\\' movies can save a life.If Owen Suskind, its autistic subject, were a fictional character, we\\'d probably rebel against the heart-tugging arc of empowerment prescribed for him. We might even scoff.Life, Animated is a feel-good documentary about autism, Disney movies and the stranglehold childhood has on adults.The film\\'s effects are maybe a little directly sentimental, but this is a tremendous true story of family love.A touch twee at times, but the use of classic and original animation is admirable, while Owen emerges as the king of sidekicks.You won\\'t find many documentaries more heart-warming than Roger Ross Williams\\' Life, Animated.A terrifically watchable, heartfelt documentary.Truth is indeed stranger and sometimes more beautiful than fiction.This is an important documentary about a developmental disability that affects so many people.The humanity on display isn\\'t grandiose, it isn\\'t cloying, it just is.\"Life, Animated\" doesn\\'t try to give a cure-all to autism. It shows how one family approached the complex puzzle with the help of Simba, Sebastian and Lumiere.It manages to be heartwarming and heartbreaking all at once.There are moments of joy, revelation, connection, sadness and hope, and the film is very, very moving.Director Roger Ross Williams\\' storytelling skills are at their finest in an engaging story suffused throughout with emotion that never descends into mawkishness. Lo and Behold seems to be stoking fears that our tools are evolving beyond our capacity to control them, which offers an intriguing twist on his usual theme of the indifference of nature.As with many Herzog films the results are complex, endlessly fascinating, sometimes disturbing and often weird.A lesser Werner, but still worth dipping your brain into.It\\'s a sporadically fascinating film that dips its toe into many different themes where perhaps it should have chosen to immerse itself in just one or two.He specialises in stories about impossible dreams and defying nature and for his latest film Werner Herzog turns to the most ambitious, abominable creation of them all: the internet.It\\'s Herzog\\'s uncertainty as a tourist in the field that gives the film its enticing charge, as surely as his wanderings in the Antarctic, or gropings in the dark to find the world\\'s oldest cave paintings.A thorough, thoughtful piece of work from Herzog, but slightly ho-hum in its fence-sitting tendencies ...This is an intriguing and provocative film which explores its subject from many different angles. What it lacks is a point of view.Herzog plays intellectual explorer, notching up points of view like a kid in a cerebral candy store.As long as Herzog continues to mouth his mysterioso epiphanies, it can\\'t be all bad.If [Herzog\\'s] closing image of a campfire reads a touch obvious, you can\\'t really argue with his point, or its poetic justice.The unsparing eye feels a little more sparing than usual.It\\'s fascinating, scary (so scary), interesting stuff.It\\'s increasingly possible that the meme of Werner Herzog is surpassing the man. I found myself spending much of Lo and Behold hoping Herzog would get out of the way.The shape of things to come is a subject very dear to the hearts of the high-tech evangelists Herzog talks to, and it accounts for the pulse of freakish comedy that beats through \"Lo and Behold.\"The Existential Pondering-ometer goes into the red zone. There will be robots.Any of its ten chapters could probably have sustained features of their own. But an overarching vision emerges anyway, even if it\\'s one Herzog never states explicitly.An absorbing visual treatise on technology and the internet... Documentarian Herzog explores the effect on individual lives to the interconnectedness of the planet.Herzog breaks the internet, cracks it open to carefully examine the insides - the glorious possibilities and the devastating potential pitfalls.The film is saved from mere competence by that Herzogian feeling, at once grandiose and self-deprecating. Fire at Sea is a powerful, and beautifully shot, look at the migrant crisis-one that manages to subvert viewer expectations of what has become for many a familiar news subject.Who needs voiceovers when a director\\'s camera has this much to say?A fascinating study in contrasts, \"Fire at Sea\\' shows how the normal and painfully abnormal exist side by side - the horrific and the serene, the tragic and the mundane, global crisis and daily humdrum.Though conceived as a humanitarian statement, the movie wouldn\\'t be as memorable or challenging without its quotidian aspect.We feel the bewilderment of the parochial yet decent residents, the helplessness of the well-intentioned yet overwhelmed rescuers, and the anguish and disorientation of the refugees.What makes the movie worth seeing, is the sequence with the Africans chanting in the detention center about making it from Africa, through the scorching Sudanese desert and Libya, to Lampedusa.Fire at Sea is a shining example of journalism fueled by outrage and shaped by free-ranging curiosity.What \"Fire at Sea\" appears to be and what it is are not the same thing, and it\\'s that difference that makes it a masterful documentary.Rosi films the migrants empathetically but sentimentally; he depicts helicopters and ships with bombastic grandeur. What\\'s more, half the movie has nothing to do with migrants ...As laudable as the movie is, it does not quite achieve greatness. That\\'s the fault of both its indirectness and its obviousness.Harrowing, heartbreaking and humane ...\"Fire at Sea\" occupies your consciousness like a nightmare, and yet somehow you don\\'t want it to end.How do you reconcile trauma like this with the easy rhythms of ordinary life? You don\\'t, Rosi\\'s film tells us, and to do so would be obscene.Here is an island. Things happen on and near that island. Some of those things are heartbreaking. Others are banal. The end.Constructed as much as reported, Fire at Sea is a beautiful artifact presented for your contemplation. It is also an act of conscience. And it is harrowing.Fire at Sea initiates a narrative that probes the fundamental gap between wanting to help and actually being able to do so.Rosi disguises the urgency of these unfolding horrors with a stately, procedural crawl. There is no political grandstanding or direct campaigning, but this is a call to arms from those left to ferry the corpses.[A] restrained, humane documentary.Sometimes real life provides us with symbolic imagery that is every bit as potent and sophisticated as anything you would find in a fictional narrative.Moral courage and filmic artistry exist side by side in this essential offering from a director gradually earning the right to be thought of as one of the greats of our era. The shocking truth is uncomfortably pursued to its fullest, and the result is a riveting piece of investigative journalism.It\\'s not a film you\\'ll soon forget.David Farrier and Dylan Reeve\\'s Tickled defies belief and almost description.Tickled is an unexpectedly engrossing documentary that\\'s built around the hitherto unexplored (on film anyway) world of \"competitive endurance tickling\".It would be unfair to spoil the surprises in David Farrier and Dylan Reeve\\'s investigative documentary Tickled, but the premise should be enough to draw you in.More meaningfully, Tickled offers an anatomy of intimidation that feels particularly relevant for our post-Gamergate times.It\\'s hard to explain how cleverly the film is structured without giving away crucial twists.A fascinating piece of investigative film-making about a subject that is not nearly as innocuously fluffy as it sounds.Like Stories We Tell or Dig!, Tickled subverts your expectations. Definitely strange rather than ha-ha.Tickled starts out being a documentary about how funny-weird the internet is, gradually crosses the loose, porous line into how scary-weird it is, and proceeds down one particular rabbit-hole which has nothing reassuringly cuddly at the end of it.A stranger-than-fiction voyage into that cultural abyss known as the internet.Unexpected and brilliant.Tickled doesn\\'t quite answer all of the questions it brings up... but it is a fascinating and disturbing descent into a particular online underworld that continues to confirm that the internet is a vast and mysterious place.The film is an investigative thriller that unravels the deep web of lies, threats and deceit that festers in the dark corners of the internet, and shows how online behavior can have damaging, real-world implications.It\\'s fun, exciting, freakish filmmaking.There are lessons to be learned here; hopefully, they will shine through the murk.These are really stories about power, shame, and the law.Like the activity of its title, \"Tickled\" is funny until it most decidedly isn\\'t.Not quite answering every question it asks, \"Tickled\" still opens a dangerous \"can of worms\" of stranger-than-fiction journalism.The dangers of the internet have rarely been presented so convincingly. The film-making might not be particularly polished, but the subject matter of this documentary is wrenching.The power of Clay Tweel\\'s tear-jerking documentary, based on Gleason\\'s video diaries, comes from the honesty and humour with which Gleason presents the gradual loss of control over his bodily functions.A moving testament to the courage shown by Gleason and his formidable wife, Michel ...The film is moving and insightful because it is more concerned with being honest than with being uplifting.Frank, unashamed and bruising.A remarkable, heartrending portrait that showcases the triumph of the human spirit at its most raw.The videos are a way for Gleason to say everything he can to his baby boy before time runs out. That\\'s enough to leave you a blubbering mess, but this doc, culled from home videos by director Clay Tweel, goes much further.It\\'s a tough watch, but inspiring.However many Kleenex you think you should bring, double it.You don\\'t need to know Steve Gleason\\'s name to be enraptured by his extraordinary story.As Gleason\\'s physical condition worsens, the documentary becomes a harrowing study in marital devotion, capturing him and his loyal wife, Michel Varisco, in a series of increasingly bleak moments together.\"Gleason\" immerses the viewer in the ordeal of incurable illness. Not just that of the sufferer, but of family, friends, and loved ones as well, because, as these films make clear, such misfortunes are not just personal, but communal.\"Gleason\" portrays great strength and great suffering in equal measure, lending vivid credence to tired platitudes about what it means to live life to the fullest.A lot of sports-themed films put a heroic, inspirational spin on the proceedings. You cheer, shed a few tears, and move on. That\\'s so not \"Gleason.\"As inspiring as it is devastating.Tweel has crafted a film that goes beyond the facts of Gleason\\'s football life. It promotes an awareness of ALS that trumps any well-intended ice-bucket challenge - and ranks as a profound achievement.The documentary Gleason, a big Sundance hit, is difficult to watch -- and that\\'s the point.A tearjerker of a film but also a joyous one.While the director\\'s vision never strays too far from the positive message that he and the Gleasons doubtlessly wish to impart, the movie winds up being most effective at doing what cinema cannot avoid doing.If this film portrait stirs deep emotions, they spring from a breathtakingly unsentimental embrace of life at its most challenging. Perhaps the director has fudged it a bit, but his intention was to make a beautiful film about one girl from a place and a culture we know little about. That he has done.Can we call this documentary, or is it some kind of hybrid, when so much of it is constructed for the camera?A soaring, sweet documentary that welcomes its audience into an unexpected new arena.There\\'s no doubt about the veracity of Aisholpan\\'s inspirational story. She exists, and she\\'s a champion in every sense. But many sequences in the film appear planned out, even staged.DOP Simon Niblett\\'s camera seems to fly over the steppe as dozens of eagle hunters gather for the national championship where this well-loved daughter and classic sports underdog must prove herself in a stirring contest.It\\'s spectacular at best; watchable even at worst.This lovely ode to change (which gets you thinking, not just about gender but all hierarchies) contains two powerful youngsters. It should really be called The Eaglet and her Girl.Whether or not the storytelling here is disingenuous, there remains a manipulative quality to the film-making that is, in the end, off-putting.Otto Bell\\'s beautiful, cinematically innovative documentary ... strikes at the very heart of our primal instincts to strive and succeed.A vivifying, sometimes inspiring watch ...This is a very nicely filmed piece of work.With a childish pink bow in her hair, Aisholpan proves to be the most unexpected heroine: small, smiley, strong as a mountain pony and filled with quiet determination.The Eagle Huntress is a remarkable documentary, one that combines superb National Geographic-style photography with a storyline that plays out like a real-life folktale with a feminist undertow.Aisholpan is one of life\\'s trailblazers - a feminist pioneer.he Eagle Huntress is a rousing adventure and a soaring testament to the strength of the human spirit, this vibrant, electrifying teenager an inspirational role model all of Mongolia should be more than proud of.The film\\'s feminist message is hardly subtle, but it\\'s still effective. And the peak into the nomad lifestyle - where an eagle just sits on a perch in the living room - is fascinating.The outline of a modern feminist epic is always there in the background. What\\'s surprising is how fresh and charming the movie manages to be.Factor in the feel-good story, Bell\\'s bracing cinematography, and his meticulous observance of the villagers\\' customs and environments, and the film becomes a multilayered exploration of dignity, perseverance, and progress.Documentarian Otto Bell\\'s titular huntress - a 13-year-old Kazakh named Aisholpan who hails from a family boasting generations of champion (male) eagle hunters - is impossible not to like and/or root for.Bell translates another culture\\'s traditions into the tired platitudes of a second-rate Disney animation. Survivors give gripping accounts of events, while journalist Eric Schlosser (on whose book the documentary is based) explains that the risks of an accidental nuclear-weapon explosion have always been much higher than we imagined.As a child, I worried about nuclear war. It never occurred to me that I should have been worried about a nuclear accident.The inescapable conclusion is that we have more to fear from our own human error than from our enemies\\' malevolence.There\\'s an important story to tell here, one about the risks created by the very people and things we employ to keep us secure, but not enough to fill the 92-minute runtime.A terrifying documentary that\\'ll have your heart racing as fast as any Hollywood thriller, Kenner\\'s film reveals that, due to a range of errors and accidents, we were very close, more than once, to detonating a nuke on our own soil.Lots of documentaries these days will tell you to be afraid, to be very afraid, but few will scare you as coolly and as convincingly as \"Command and Control.\"Proceeds like a real-life thriller, one with striking parallels to its narrative contemporary Deepwater Horizon.Kenner and Schlosser not only remind us of a danger that never went away, but honor the men whose bravery was never recognized.A terrifying dossier of denial and neglect.Far from being a historical cautionary tale, \"Command and Control\" looks forward, not backward. Kenner\\'s unsettling film casts its worried gaze not at the accidents that already have taken place, but at the ones yet to happen.Despite the high stakes, Command and Control is morbidly fun to watch, in the manner of good suspense thrillers and disaster films.What gives Command and Control its urgency are both its wealth of information and the implications of its story.Archival footage is combined with somewhat affected-looking re-enactments, but the film achieves its purpose: to remind us that we still have thousands of bombs, and neither they - nor we - have gotten that much smarter.The pace of the drama is riveting, as it jumps back through the decades to place the accident in the context of the nuclear arms race.Since 1980, our weaponry has grown far more sophisticated; whether the sophistication of its handlers has grown as well is something you\\'ll be pondering after the ending credits roll.Robert Kenner\\'s stylistic choices amplify the film\\'s fetishistic fascination with the nuclear weaponry itself.Kenner creates a brisk, efficient exploration of a troubling moment in our history, with questions that are very much of this moment.Equal parts history lesson, cautionary tale and nerve-rattling thriller, using all manner of nonfiction devices to elicit both horror and outrage over the precariousness of our deadliest arsenals. English writer and theologian John Hull, who went blind in the early 1980s and kept an audio diary of his experience, is the subject of this thought-provoking film, which takes an unusual if not always successful approach to the documentary form.Achingly poignant and startlingly immediateA deeply sensitive interpretation of the subject\\'s reflective testament on disability.Quite often, the filmmakers go for blurry scenery, surreal events and odd camera shots that feel more like gimmicks than an accurate representation of its subject\\'s affliction.The filmmakers create art out of what too often is a documentary stopgap.The tone of the narration is so wrenchingly honest that the film never lapses into self-pity or relies on mystical platitudes.Its fatal mistake is to make up for blindness, instead of embracing it as something other than a liability.Befitting Hull\\'s original project, Notes on Blindness is achingly, poignantly human.As educational, entertaining and inspirational as its subject.This is a very original film about a daunting subject, namely the shock of living with blindness.This is not just a tale of struggle and courage, a relearning of the world\\'s signals, however, but also a moving portrait of family life.[A] richly evocative and thought-provoking film ...The tone is sober, unflashy, and Hull\\'s reflections on God are presented without any hectoring or special pleading. Affecting and profoundly intelligent.Perhaps you have sometimes wondered: how would you even begin to make a film about going blind and being blind and what that means?... Even if that\\'s so you\\'ll still find Notes on Blindness to be a singular achievement, as well as a truly wonderful one.With the exception of John and Marilyn, faces are obscured, which feels right: why should we be allowed to see their son (or the actor playing him) when John has never seen him?A fascinating documentary from the first-timer team of James Spinney and Peter Middleton.A mature, respectable, gently moving discussion that lacks a killer hook.The depiction of early 1980s Britain - dark, rainy, almost entirely brown - is especially vivid.[An] elegant, evocative and deeply affecting documentary. Lane\\'s loose, playful, collage-like treatment of the story sets just the right tone.Director Lane and screenwriter Thom Stylinski take a lighthearted, folksy approach to telling Brinkley\\'s life storyLane uses creative animation, archival footage and recordings - the good doctor apparently loved to be filmed - to tell an absolutely outrageous story of neediness, greed, delusion and gullibility.It\\'s a daring formal gamble on Lane\\'s part, but it doesn\\'t completely work.It\\'s flat-out exciting; really, how many documentaries can you say that about?I can\\'t imagine anyone believing that goat glands transplanted into human reproductive organs could cure impotence, but as this lively, offbeat documentary proves, plenty of Americans did.\"NUTS!\" starts out as one kind of character study and turns into a very different one. The gullible believe in miracles, fortunes are built and lost, and an entire generation is deliberately misled.This savvy director plays with history and viewers\\' conceptions of traditional documentary filmmaking, expounding in a way upon Stephen Colbert\\'s concept of \"truthiness.\"[An] entertaining hornswoggle of a movie.In ways good and bad, his was a distinctly American story, and filmmaker Penny Lane uses a variety of techniques to bring out its strangeness and specialness.\"Nuts!\" is an intriguing, if patronizing, curio from the cabinet of American arcana, a geegaw from the collective attic that, when dusted off, looks grotesquely funny in the light of today.The movie deconstructs the process of self-mythologizing from the inside out.This is one of the most entertaining documentaries to come along in some time.This marvelous, mostly animated doc/drama hybrid couldn\\'t have come along at a better time.Lane has a gift for finding the unexpected in the familiar, the right narrative structure, however eccentric, to tell a story.\"Nuts!,\" an inventive documentary directed by Penny Lane (\"Our Nixon\") from Thom Stylinski\\'s script, tells a quintessentially American story - one that elicits both wonder and horror.Lane, like any great storyteller, springs surprises after luring her audience in.Throughout, director Penny Lane strings together telling incidents and anecdotes with a light touch.Filmmaker Penny Lane (real name) spoon-feeds the audience the myth that we so steadfastly cling to. Then, she pulls the rug out.Lane revels in the story\\'s playfully nostalgic wonders without stinting on its implications or its passions. A biographical tale that captures more than just the story.The Last Man on the Moon is a compelling, artful and fantastically straight-faced documentary portrait of the now 82-year-old Eugene Cernan.Craig\\'s film deals with the fallout of the era - and how the returning heroes kept their feet on the ground - but he can\\'t help but get swept up in the romance of the effort.Given the wealth of footage available, you can\\'t really go wrong with docs on the Apollo era - and yet amongst all that, Cernan is compellingly frank about the human costs of spaceflight.Tales of remarkable men in extraordinary times.Cernan knows how to spin a great yarn, and if you do zone out for a moment, he can quickly reel you back in with the time he nearly died on his Gemini 9 mission or the surprisingly fierce politics behind his being chosen for the Apollo 10 crew.Cernan is an interesting guy -- interesting in himself and interesting as a type.The filmmakers, attempting to jazz up their material, get in the way a lot.The film traces Cernan\\'s career trajectory, going back to his days in San Diego as a hot-shot naval aviator, blending terrific archival footage with contemporary perspectives to quietly poetic effect.You already know the history told in \"The Last Man on the Moon,\" but this story just never grows old.Craig charts the flight path of Cernan\\'s life from his years as a naval aviator flying off aircraft carriers in the late 1950s to his selection as an astronaut in 1963 and his trips into space.Craig never makes his interviews, the film\\'s brick and mortar, feel revelatory or vital.Cernan is clearly still in awe of what America achieved during those cowboy years - but he also speaks, with the melancholy that results from several decades of hindsight, about the havoc it wreaked on the personal lives of the astronauts.This is a great documentary about a great man.Director Mark Craig struggles to construct a terrestrial portrait of Cernan, now a Houston retiree in his 80s, and one senses a man powerless against the gravitational pull of his career.\"The Last Man on the Moon\" is one of those movies we didn\\'t realize we needed, but turns out to be just the thing for our fractured, cynical times.Cernan is proud of what he accomplished, calling himself the luckiest man in the world for all that he got to see. But he also expresses regret at having done it at the expense of his family.Take a pinch of Top Gun, stir in a generous dollop of The Right Stuff, add a light sprinkling of Mad Men and you have the formula for this uplifting documentary portrait of former Apollo astronaut Eugene Cernan.Craig\\'s film stirs emotions closer to what Cernan exclaimed when first stepping into the lunar dust: \"Oh, my golly! Unbelievable!\"The Last Man on the Moon alternates between archival footage and current interviews, the latter tinged with nostalgia and regret. But Craig avoids either lionizing or reducing his subject. In a perfect world, \"Zappa in his own words\" would really mean nothing but his music and lyrics, which is where he would be truly himself - but this is nonetheless a thoroughly entertaining watch.Any true Zappa fan will eat this stuff up. For novices it may open up the universe.\"Eat That Question\" may be of most interest to Zappa fans, but newcomers to the man and his music may also find it well worth a look.Trying to communicate the essence of musician Frank Zappa and his body of work in words is futile, even when the words are his own.You don\\'t have to be a fan of Frank Zappa\\'s music to enjoy \"Eat That Question: Frank Zappa in HIs Own Words,\" Thorsten Schutte\\'s documentary.Although there is some nice performance footage, the film isn\\'t a good way for a beginner to get a grip on Zappa\\'s music, which spans from proto-punk to classical. It is a nice journey through Zappa\\'s mind for the already converted.Eat That Question, a fascinating and compelling dive into an artist\\'s uniquely ticking parts, gives voice to a complex dude and broadens the picture.Zappa was never at a loss for words.There\\'s no small irony in a Frank Zappa doc being built around the man\\'s interviews, since he regarded journalism as a form of torture.Frank Zappa was an innovative composer and musician, but as this royally entertaining documentary illustrates, he was also an articulate and opinionated man, high-minded and mordantly funny.Amusing and even edifying, although it is also unlikely to make converts out of those who just don\\'t get Zappa\\'s pastiche of juvenile parody and sophisticated songwriting, derived from rock, jazz and 20th-century experimental music.\"Eat That Question\" will please Zappa fans, but it\\'s not just for fans only. It serves as a great introduction to an important artist who was ahead of his time.His rock music gets a decent airing, but you wish more of the man\\'s perversity came through: his intimidating ego, the way he could exhaust his bandmates.Eat That Question is a fitting title for a movie that never quite gets at the mystery of Zappa\\'s contradictions, even as it stacks up intimate live clips and fierce monologues from a rich trove of vintage interviews.The movie put me on a major Zappa listening jag ... which makes it sound like a fan-only proposition. It kind of might be, but I hope it isn\\'t.Seeing Mr. Sch??tte\\'s film, I\\'m reminded of how much more there was to explain about Zappa, and delighted to find how well the film explains it almost a quarter-century after his death.Along the way, we are given an overview of Zappa\\'s career, from his early albums with the Mothers of Invention through his not particularly accessible classical compositions.Along the way, we learn some things that may be surprising.Zappa made for a good celebrity if a rotten musician, and his takes on language and fame keep this doc sprightly and engaging.There\\'s no explicit attempt to put forth a Grand Unifying Theory of Zappa; Sch??tte immerses us in the competing aspects of Zappa\\'s public persona for their own sake. The results are fascinating. It\\'s remarkable how Gibney packs complex, jargon-heavy ideas into a neat package.Be very afraid.This documentary might be better titled Day Zero, because it features a doomsday scenario in which cyberwarfare shuts down the electricity grids and other networks of entire countries, using computer malware.Gibney plays up the thriller elements of his story.Gibney\\'s new cyber-war documentary brilliantly unpacks the story behind the Stuxnet virus, created by the CIA and US government to sabotage the Iran nuclear programme.Unnerving and likely to give viewers some bitter food for thought, Zero Days is Gibney\\'s most important work yet.Zero Days makes clear that we\\'re already enmeshed in this terrifying new cyber-reality. And unfortunately for us all, we\\'ll need more than John McClane to help avert forthcoming global disaster.Gibney is surely right in calling for open and informed debate about cyber warfare, but his own movie lacks transparency and persuasiveness. What a terrible moment for this director to go unclear.This is no dry position paper; he paces \\'Zero Days\\' like a thriller, and a relentless one, throwing maps, graphics, context, and information at us with intensity and urgency.Gibney\\'s movies are professional and solidly executed, informative if you go in underinformed but rarely surprising or aesthetically noteworthy.Zero Days is ... under attack from little stylistic worms that threaten to turn an otherwise solid doc on the evil that 21st-century hackers do into a hack job.Since no terrorist group or nation state has ever claimed credit for Stuxnet, Gibney can only hypothesize about its origins, but he makes an alarmingly lucid (if circumstantial) case for the culpability of the United States and Israel.Don\\'t be distracted by the ominous score, the layered displays of code, the juxtaposition of bursting balloon and mushrooming cloud; that\\'s just (alarm) bells and whistles.By necessity, far more questions than answers are raised in Zero Days. All of the questions and answers are troubling.Easily the most important film anyone has released this year, it is a documentary that deserves to be seen by every sentient citizen of this country - and indeed the world.The most terrifying movie you will see this year.Director Alex Gibney does this vital material a disservice, giving it an air of deflated pomposity.In documentary filmmaking, as in news writing, there is a fine line between irresponsible alarmism and dispassionate reportage. And Mr. Gibney has a proven record of tiptoeing to the edge without going too far.Gibney delivers plenty to think about - and fear.You\\'ll want to see \"Zero Days\"-just not when you\\'re counting on a good night\\'s sleep a few hours later. It\\'s an undeniably excellent film and a much-needed tribute to both Baldwin and the racial politics of the 1960s and ??70s... The only shortcoming of Peck\\'s film is its almost complete erasure of Baldwin\\'s homosexuality.Its themes are as important today as they were yesterday, especially in the current climate of radical right-wing ideas and racist sentiment sweeping Trump\\'s America.Baldwin\\'s fury and his despair come through in vivid fashion, making this film not just an important social document, but an essential work of art.While I Am Not Your Negro remains an astounding statement about race, a sequel that makes his queerness visible is sorely needed.This is a must-see movie.I Am Not Your Negro is an utterly brilliant film - bold, galvanising, even gripping...... Baldwin\\'s words - sometimes spoken by Samuel L. Jackson - guide us through the narrative, which marries archival footage of Baldwin in interviews and forums with film of his era\\'s political and cultural milestones.What is scary is how seamlessly the film transitions between the racially charged tragedies of today and the tragedies of the civil rights movement. It paints a picture that race relations have not changed in since the 1960s.An urgently needed slap-down for the history-blinkered who say \"What about all lives?\" when confronted with Black Lives Matter.Baldwin\\'s words feel as urgent and articulate as ever, though Peck\\'s attempts to link history with present-day race relations feel a little clunky next to the elegance of the text.Baldwin re-emerges as a devastatingly eloquent speaker and public intellectual; a figure who deserves his place alongside Edward Said, Frantz Fanon or Gore Vidal.The result is not a documentary about Baldwin but a vision of America through his appalled and compassionate eyes.Raoul Peck\\'s lyrical documentary was nominated for an Oscar this year, and it really should have won.[A] forcefully eloquent movie.Baldwin was writing more than 30 years ago. Not so much has changed since then. Even so, I Am Not Your Negro isn\\'t as pessimistic as its downbeat tone suggests it should be. Baldwin\\'s commentary is intended to provoke, not to induce despair.Peck\\'s film may have been an Oscars bridesmaid but it turns Baldwin\\'s prescient words into a staggering achievement. It\\'s an exhilarating blast of focused fury.We can always count on the words of one of our most important writers to illuminate our most profound concerns and be an eternal advocate, as this documentary so eloquently reminds us.It\\'s an astonishing, often challenging and sharp examination of race in the United States, confronting how the country\\'s history repeats and how Baldwin insisted we must remember, relentlessly question, remain conscientious and resist.The result - hard-hitting and insightful - is a reminder that the more things change, the more they stay the same.\"I Am Not Your Negro\" is important. And urgent. And almost certainly unlikely to be seen by the people who would benefit from it most. Faces Places is a wonderful exercise in memory and merriment, in instinct and improvisation.Faces Places is the most melancholy yet uplifting buddy movie you\\'ll see all year.Varda and JR make a surprisingly empathetic team and their collaboration is as provocative as it is poetic and poignant.It\\'s more than wandering whimsy, with telling comments on decaying industry and Instagram narcissism and a sting in the tail that can only be described as Godardian.This is a film that puts old women centre stage and it\\'s the best film that puts old women centre stage since... nope, can\\'t think of one.A beguiling and utterly unique piece of work.A typical, even archetypal, Varda mixture of the combative and the contemplative.As JR explains, the project is about him and Varda expressing their imaginations on people\\'s terrain, and they do it graciously and with good cheer.\"Faces Places\" is a lively, fun, stirring tribute to art and its ability to touch people and bring souls together.There\\'s a chemistry and respect between the two of them, palpable in the film\\'s first moments, that is inspiring. And when the credits roll 89 minutes later, you realize that this is one journey where you never once crankily asked, \"Are we there yet?\"Anyone who can\\'t enjoy this wise and soulful film has to consider whether they\\'ve given up on the movies, and on life.[A] delightful, artful road trip ...The pair makes an oddly compelling Harold and Maude coupling, touring the countryside in a minibus-cum-box camera and honoring the locals by turning the facades of buildings into ephemeral open-air portrait galleries.This movie, a diary of a freewheeling, far-flung installation art project, combines chance and intuition and a humane eye.There\\'s never been a film quite like this one.This delightful, digressive, breezy collaboration, staged to look more spontaneous than it possibly could be, celebrates and enhances both artists, repeatedly finding the extraordinary in the ordinary.\"Faces Places\" is a film of sheer joy, its exuberance surpassed only by its tenderness and purity of purpose.I don\\'t need a thesaurus to describe my reaction to Faces Places. I can sum it up in two words: pure pleasure.... a testament to Varda\\'s own talent and a truly special piece of filmmaking.\"Faces Places\" turns out to be a road movie in more than a merely literal sense. It is at once a roving journey into environments we rarely see in cinema and an incomplete but invaluable map of Varda\\'s memories. Kedi (\\'cat\\' in Turkish) is much more than a cute film showing these felines\\' day-to-day lives.The delightful Kedi portrays a complex city founded on history and tradition, and surrounded by goodwill, magnificence, and fragility.Part wildlife documentary, part urban love letter. Kedi may only be a slender 79 minutes long, but it\\'s a lyrical and surprising philosophical tribute to the therapeutic power of pets.The cats are captured with adoring attentiveness, their intelligent eyes narrowing to slits, their darting movements, a patch of sun-warmed fur, the way one kitten clambers a market stall to paw a pile of oranges.Filmed at whisker-height, this charming documentary enters the daily lives of the many street cats of Istanbul.You needn\\'t be a cat lover to enjoy Kedi, since the film will make you one anyway.It is by turns intriguing, amusing and a little bit twee.This is the film the world needs right now.One of the most impressive elements in a very likeable documentary is the balance Torun strikes between analysis and affection in her approach toward her feline protagonists.A purrfect antidote to blockbuster fatigue.There\\'s no more to it than that, but an attractive music score, incorporating several Turkish songs, makes for an engaging film that\\'s easy on the eye and the ear - especially for cat and/or Istanbul lovers.\"Kedi\" is the cat\\'s meow. Literally.A work of unconditional love that celebrates a spot on Earth where an odd symbiosis between humanity and a purring segment of nature has flourished for centuries.Humans can only draw so many lessons from cats.Cats wander in and out of frame; humans speculate on whether the local cats are ambitious or arrogant; Turkish music spills onto the soundtrack; and there\\'s more than one growler of a catfight.Though pleasant to watch, Torun\\'s feature debut feels more like a meandering montage than a structured narrative, and it could easily be half as long.Those who don\\'t especially like cats - or Istanbul, for that matter - might not get a lot out of Turkish director Ceyda Torun\\'s love letter to the feline population of her native city. For everyone else, it should be an almost unadulterated pleasure.This is the kind of movie I love best - one that starts small, then reveals, slowly but surely, that all of life is contained somewhere inside of it.I loved it and I am more of a dog person, though I admit to having bonded with a few felines in my day. I daresay even elephant or giraffe people will love it, too.\\'Kedi\\' is steeped in charm and simple wisdom. I should state flat-out that I am not a cat person, but this film won me over all the same Edited together with a fluidity and polish rare even in the best documentary films.A moving but flawed piece of documentary that could stand to fill in a few blanks, Jane is bolstered by a powerful score, sharp editing and an abundance of fascinating archive footage.Watching Jane was like stepping back in time to a moment at which Homo sapiens learned something new and vital about its own family - the great apes. It was extraordinary.This is documentary as beguiling storytelling.Like so many women in pursuit of their studies, Goodall had to tolerate being studied herself.Goodall makes for fine company and every single tableau is breathtaking.Brett Morgen\\'s elegant if rather one-note documentary follows Jane Goodall, one of the top authorities on chimpanzees, from fearless twentysomething to respected eco-ambassador.It\\'s most evocative as a memorable portrait of a woman, both in youth and late life, who always knew what she wanted - and who, in doing so, helped make the world a better place.The film\\'s main asset is undoubtedly the magnificent Goodall, as poised, articulate and engaged in her 80s as she was in her fearless 20s ...A portrait of the primatologist as a young woman.... a fascinating affair, both as a natural history film and as a closely focused study of a woman who lived her own real-life version of The Jungle Book.Top marks for all-family educative entertainment.Sublimely scored by Philip Glass, this inspiring, unsentimental portrait not only glows but is an empowering must-see every mother should take her daughter too - or vice versa.Perhaps we\\'ve all been spoilt by \\'Blue Planet\\', but that original footage doesn\\'t feel strong enough stretched out over 90 minutes.A charming, formulaic portrait of a wonderful woman and the chimps of her life.Jane is Brett Morgen\\'s gorgeous, convincing new documentary on Jane Goodall, the one-time ape watcher and current UN messenger of peace.Goodall has left her mark on the world and this documentary ably and engagingly celebrates that legacy.Writer-director Brett Morgen makes the most of both the find and his still-living subject: image and story alike are packed with rich color and affecting detail.Jane is a triumph of filmmaking, and essential viewing for humans.The film confronts not just the expected issue of environmentalism but also explores themes of survival, separation, loss, and death. Astonishing viewing - but it will haunt you.There are the makings of a gripping story in these elements. But somehow City of Ghosts never quite comes together.This film will give you a new appreciation for the freedoms that are often taken for granted in a democracy.An important story that loses something in the telling.There is zero \"fake news\" here.\"City of Ghosts\" isn\\'t merely about the personal sacrifices of these men, but a testament to the necessity of a free and open press the world over.Heineman powerfully captures the agonizing sense of displacement these men must feel. Gaunt, lanky, chain-smoking RBSS founder Aziz is an emotionally wounded, haunted figure. The \"ghosts\" in the title doesn\\'t just apply to those killed in Raqqa.Ultimately it\\'s not the violence that is most disturbing. It\\'s the effect on the central characters of the film, forced into exile, tallying each new death, each tortured friend or family member from afar.A clearly significant document, bringing compassionate immediacy and personalised humanity to an unfolding catastrophe.This is a harrowing watch, with footage of executions -- the emotional toll on the men is tangible. Yet RBSS is performing an essential duty; it is often the only conduit of reliable news from Raqqa to the wider world.Matthew Heineman gets up close and personal with some of the RBSS members, who live with the daily threat of violent retribution and in some scenes comment from the cloistered security of German or Turkish safe houses.It\\'s about providing chapter, verse, word, dot and comma about factional brutality and its methods in a moment of history, so that no one is condemned by ignorance - or excused by it - to repeat that history.[An] infuriating documentary.This is a powerful testament to a new kind of citizens\\' digital journalism.The documentary can\\'t provide an upbeat finale. Instead, it shows how its subjects try to carry on living their lives in spite of the sacrifices they\\'ve had to make.City Of Ghosts wears three hats with aplomb - a summation of the tragedy that\\'s befallen Syria, how horror can be resisted with just laptops, phones and courage, and the importance of shining a light into the darker corners of the world.No other film has so convincingly, or so urgently, illustrated the role that media will play in our fight for the future.City of Ghosts, a documentary by Matthew Heineman, provides a vision of dedication to reportorial truth in the desperate efforts of an improvised news organization with a haunting, if unwieldy name: \"Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently,\" or RBSS.Part of what makes \"City of Ghosts\" compelling is a chance to view disturbing footage of ISIS atrocities, clandestinely shot with cellphones and so revealing and incendiary the videoers faced death if captured.\"City of Ghosts\" provides a grim reminder of what journalism should look like, and why its stakes are literally life and death. We come away with a contemplative suspicion that we\\'re all participating in something, and even if we don\\'t ever get to see the big picture, there probably is one and it might even make sense.The true magic that \"Dawson City\" captures is, simply, the mystery of film itself: a medium that turned people into shadows that burned brighter than life.This film tells two stories, both fascinating. Morrison\\'s purposeful editing and story sense make Frozen Time a mesmerizing taleIn \"Dawson City,\" Morrison offers a fiercely precise and discerning look at movies themselves as embodiments of history.The film moves at a stately pace, but that just makes it cumulative effect all the more powerful. Time had its way with Dawson City as it has its way with the rest of the world, but there\\'s much to learn, and beauty to see, in what\\'s been left behind.Bill Morrison, whose extraordinary documentary Decasia turned decomposing film stock into the stuff of avante-garde reverie, returns with another staggering journey into the past.The thrilling documentary \"Dawson City: Frozen Time\" is indescribable not because it\\'s ambiguous (it\\'s totally straightforward) but because it does so many things so beautifully it is hard to know where to begin.The movie\\'s aesthetic is uniquely beautiful.As an act of preservation, Frozen Time is a marvel, a miracle, a complete good. As an act of storytelling, it\\'s still a bit too cold for the nitrate to catch fire.The rise and fall of Dawson City, intimately tied to the vagaries of climate and man\\'s greed, is heartbreakingly rendered.A film that offers an abundance of celluloid and historical riches.An instantaneously recognizable masterpiece.Frozen Time is at its best in moments ... when it uses Morrison\\'s obsessive interest in cinematic detritus to express rather than inform.I miss the weird, metaphoric entropy, which Morrison would always score but not narrate, but watching this forgotten history happen is cool, too.Throughout, filmmaker Bill Morrison mixes documentarian detail with an ecstatic sense of poetry.Documentarian Bill Morrison delivers a worthy follow-up to his classic 2002 film Decasia with another cinematic tone poem dedicated to the glories of silent cinema.While the film\\'s purview may suggest a PBS documentary, the density of Morrison\\'s detail and the twists in his long-game storytelling make for a constant titillating simmer of discovery, a secret history round every corner. Never has a 4,000-year-old aphorism seemed more devastatingly of the moment. But the results are inspiring: it seems The Work works.Sceptics may enter Folsom with suspicion, but these are extraordinary scenes, so shocking and dynamic they might be mistaken for exorcisms.More than just an advertisement for the process depicted, The Work carries a profound, implicit point about a culture that encourages men to bottle up what they feel, then condemns them after those emotions express themselves in violent, destructive ways.True, these hardest of the hard men are killers, kidnappers, and gangbangers, but watching them collapsing into shrieking and sobbing piles of fear, shame, and regret humanizes them, startlingly so.Opening an aperture into a process so ego-stripping that it feels unseemly to witness, \"The Work\" is enlightening yet also punishing.A simple, tense, gritty auditing of a collective unburdening that obviously brings some needed clarity, and the promise of rehabilitation, to some hurt, searching souls.By simply watching the participants talk about their feelings, sometimes in the vaguest of terms, McLeary illustrates how men build strong faades to conceal their pain from others and themselves.The movie valuably demonstrates how, for some, when it comes to rehabilitation, it\\'s never too late to do \"the work.\"In its visceral purity, the film drags male toxicity up into the light, offering it as a cure for itself.Jairus McLeary\\'s stirring documentary is a riveting account of Folsom Prison\\'s unusual way of rehabilitating inmates: through a group therapy akin to an exorcism.There\\'s something indescribably moving about watching grown men - at least one of whom has tried to cut another man in half - wail and sob.Just spending time with this motley crew makes the world seem a saner place.For the open-minded this is moving, even wrenching viewing that might inspire similar approaches in British institutions.[A] riveting prison documentary.The Work makes gruelling viewing at times - it\\'s more like psychotherapy than entertainment - but, by the end, viewers will feel as if they\\'ve been on the same rewarding journey as the subjects.Not to sound trite, but it\\'s a damn privilege to watch this movie.Some context is lost in favour of a lot of weeping and wailing, but this remains an eye-opening experience.This is not just an exercise in soul-searching by a group of overprivileged navel-gazing males enjoying a bonding session in the woods, but a rather touching, enlightening and at times harrowing experience.Say what you will about prison\\'s capacity to reform, but this documentary makes clear that in its own special way, the \"work\" is working.The Work chronicles a kind of breakneck psychoanalysis in which the origins of problematic behavior are dramatically expunged in public. Ms. Fisher is brainy and salty and hilarious, and she\\'s frank and eloquent in describing being bipolar.This is the film we have - one that is likely to leave those who loved Reynolds or Fisher loving them even more.Bright Lights is a heartbreaking tribute to a singular mother-daughter relationship.HBO moving \\'Bright Lights\\'\\' premiere could play as a rather ghoulish bit of exploitation. But it doesn\\'t, because the film is such a celebration of both extraordinary women, and the bond they shared right up to their final days.The film transcends utility. It\\'s a sober yet gracious cautionary tale about fame and fandom and a powerful portrait of love in action.Bright Lights plucks [Fisher\\'s] star and that of her mother down from distant heights and lets us gently hold them for a time, reassuring us that their brilliance and humanity was real, their mutual endearment unbreakable.Bright Lights is a much better way to remember them. It wasn\\'t supposed to double as a requiem, but who knew at the time?Thanks to its stars, and the work of directors Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens, it\\'s peppy, wistful, and a little transgressive all at once.No matter how unsinkable you are, no matter how hard you try to use The Force, it\\'s impossible to look at that image of mother and daughter, fiercely by each other\\'s sides, and do anything other than cry.Both camps will find much to move them in Bright Lights, especially the profound bond between its subjects and the obstacles that were overcome to make it last.This new documentary about Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher celebrates them in hilarious and heart-stirring fashion.A beauty that will mostly make you laugh and, of course, cry.Self-deprecating bon mots, wordplay, song lyrics and perfectly timed occasional moans are what elevate this beyond simple \"Keeping Up With\" material.Even without the sadness that now floods Bright Lights, it would still be a classic of its kind.If Bright Lights is, at times, a sharp reminder of what\\'s been lost, it\\'s also convincing evidence that wherever Fisher and Reynolds are now, they\\'re almost certainly together.Both women shine so brightly here - apart but especially together - that it drives home the enormity of their absence.It\\'s a melancholy final visit in light of the recent death of both its subjects. But it\\'s still a rare chance for viewers to sneak behind those weird, eccentric compound gates, and hang out as if they were part of the family.Now that they\\'re gone, the film instantly becomes the loveliest farewell gift.A tender, human, and very, very funny portrait of Hollywood royalty.Simultaneously heartwarming and heartbreaking ... Ford\\'s building blocks are familiar, but this is no call-to-action film or how-to guide for getting answers and moving on.It\\'s deceptively simple, but it does so much so well. It\\'s heartbreaking by the end...It\\'s just really, really powerful.Ford is so gifted at taking old photographs and interviews and making a movie that is always beautiful to look at.t\\'s a slightly unfocused work... but its rawness is part of its strength.A view of systemic racism through a highly personal and artistic lens.Strong builds a poignant, methodical portrait of loss. Telling William\\'s story won\\'t bring him back, but at least it will let the world know he lived.This documentary is important, not just as personal investigation, but as a statement against official records: the countless cases where indictments aren\\'t reached, where cases are closed, where young people are pressured to take plea bargains.There are questions that circle around themselves, endlessly, providing no broader outlook. However, by the same token, it is that very lack of objectivity that makes Strong Island the experience that it is. It is a very tough film to shake.The doc is a demanding, wrenching watch; an important work, if not necessarily one you\\'d recommend to your friends.If the excerpts from the diary leading up to his death don\\'t break your heart, you probably haven\\'t got one.This potent film gives equal weight to complex emotions as well as bare facts. In the same way, it\\'s not just the story of a man\\'s death, but also a study of the aftermath.Courageous, intimate, heart-rending ...What\\'s valuable here, in addition to Ford\\'s visual mastery, is the wealth of context that he provides.The pain of Will\\'s death is very much present, still, and Strong Island-one of the best films of the year-is an attempt to harness it.Ford is more than a witness-he is a crucial participant in the events of the film, and its elements of pain and guilt are reflected in his grief-stricken, self-interrogating aesthetic.The film builds, out of an outlet for discussing the tragedy of one family, into an emotionally, intellectually, and aesthetically complex work of essay and memoir.Ford\\'s intent as a filmmaker isn\\'t just to expose and protest the injustice of his brother\\'s murder. It\\'s to say: Behold what was lost. A life. A human being. A complex soul. A family\\'s equilibrium. Feel what was lost.The intimacy Ford develops is rare and transfixing. Strong Island is as much an exploration of the filmmaker\\'s identity and feelings surrounding his brother\\'s murder as it is a loving, even-handed portrait of William.Truly special, especially as it moves towards its final act, in which Yance begins to wonder about his own actions before William Jr.\\'s death, and how they might have contributed to the situation.The documentary won\\'t bring William Ford back, and it may give Yance Ford some catharsis, but more importantly it could and should lead to greater justice and empowerment. It\\'s a deeply moving work, and the passion of both the filmmakers and their subjects is palpable.Whose Streets? is an impassioned polemic.\"Whose Streets?\" illustrates a generational changing of the guard in the rhetoric and aims of social activism, along with a growing impatience and a reliance on tactics that can seem as naive as they are highly visible.Folayan and Davis have put together a magnetic look at what it was like to live in that neighborhood, to walk those streets and to experience the eruption that turned everything upside down.Bristling with unapologetic righteousness, the ragged documentary Whose Streets? takes no prisoners in its raw depiction of events transpiring in the predominantly African-American community of Ferguson, Mo., about three years ago.\"Whose Streets?\" doesn\\'t pretend to solve any problems, only illuminate those that are happening everyday. It\\'s a documentary that lives and breathes in the here and now.Told from the perspective of activists, artists, and residents, Whose Streets? is a commemoration of and tribute to the humans of Ferguson.[Whose Streets?] is a memorable snapshot of what protest looks like now, in a moment of escalating tension and an era of social media immediacy with little patience for incremental change.\"Whose Streets?\" marks the filmmaking debut of Folayan and Davis, and it\\'s charged by its personal touch.Whether it\\'s the \"best\" documentary of 2017 is a matter of opinion. But it is assuredly the most vital.Made in an impressionistic style with no narration, [Whose Streets?] is less sharp as an indictment of the media, using clips of clueless talking heads on CNN as a broad brush. It\\'s stronger as a collection of Ferguson voices and figures,It\\'s likely not even the most well-intentioned and determined news crews could gain the kind of access and give us the unfiltered viewpoints provided by the smart-phone visuals and home video camera footage shot by residents of Ferguson.A movie that doesn\\'t merely tell a gripping, important story, but reminds us that the storyteller and the storytelling matter just as much.\"Whose Streets?\" looks beyond the media narrative to offer what Davis has called \"black people seeing black people\" - validation, encouragement and love in the face of a bitter legacy of injustice.It\\'s an image of black folks painted by black folks. It depicts the whole of their experience -- from suffering to healing, from sinking through a void to retrieving one\\'s agency.This is direct and frequently powerful filmmaking that doesn\\'t much care about meeting my aesthetic standards.It uses an immediate, you-are-there format to offer a experience-driven corrective to the mainstream, sensationalist-slanted news coverage through which you initially, invariably, absorbed the events of Ferguson.Even through this more personal lens, Folayan and Davis take an evenhanded approach: civilians loot stores and burn police cars, whereas police officers fire tear gas and aim rifles at peacefully protesting crowds.A riveting street-level account, not only of Ferguson\\'s days of rage, but also the decades of marginalization and mistreatment that led up to them.It represents the spirit of something more powerful than a bullet, the seed of something good springing from a terrible and unjust event. While Journey Through French Cinema is unable to cover every single decade, and Dod knows it tries, the film will ignite in those who love French cinema a new passion for its heroes and villains.This is essential viewing for cinephiles and Francophiles alike, but others may find the three-hour-plus running time a little excessive.This is Tavernier\\'s own film story so don\\'t expect a linear, full history of the cinema of the time. However, it\\'s anything but dry, as the film swoons with passion for Gallic films and filmmaking.Mostly, there\\'s Tavernier, a happy bear of a man. He\\'s insightful, endlessly enthusiastic, all but encyclopedic in knowledge. He\\'s also highly idiosyncratic. The first word in the title is \"My,\" after all.It\\'s tempting to say that Bertrand Tavernier\\'s 3-hour-and-15-minute documentary... is a feast for everybody who loves classic Gallic movies. This is certainly true. But it\\'s also a movie for people who just plain love moviesMore distinctive and revealing are the fannish tributes to tough guys Jean Gabin and Eddie Constantine, innovative composers Maurice Jaubert and Joseph Kosma, and forgotten auteurs Edmond T. Gr??ville and Pierre Schoendoerffer.It perhaps emerges that, the more interested an artist is in a whole variety of different things, the less they may need to impose a single stamp on every work they create in response.Whoever you are, you\\'ll learn a lot.It would be a shame if the film were to be seen only by those already interested in French cinema. Anyone with an eye for grace, industry, resilience, rich shadows, and strong cigarettes should go along.Tavernier pays homage to the rich tradition of commercial yet personal, elegant but observant cinema that had already given French film a name before Godard and company drew up their canonical map, detonated their explosives and reassembled the pieces.Not just a niche film but a film for a niche of a niche.I was glued to the screen from start to finish and when it was over I wanted more. If you love film you can\\'t afford to miss the experience of seeing Bertrand Tavernier\\'s Journey Through French Cinema, especially on a theater screenIts explanatory title doesn\\'t begin to convey just how exhilarating or inspiring a documentary this truly is, and how excellent a trip this well-respected French director takes you on.A passionate, opinionated, drop-dead fascinating documentary essay about that country\\'s film history put together by a clear-eyed enthusiast who was born to tell the tale.A selective, eccentric survey of the richest periods of French moviemaking and, by extension, film in general.Tavernier\\'s own adolescent obsession with the films of Jacques Becker gets the movie off to a choppy start, but the variety of inspirations (not to mention the visual quality of the film clips) is astonishing.Essential viewing for cinephiles and Francophiles alike.Bertrand Tavernier\\'s exquisite documentary consistently avoids mere hagiography by looking to the films themselves. Tthe family members - Quest; his rock-solid wife, Christine\\'a; and their teenage daughter P.J., who gains in character and complexity as she grows up before our eyes-are too individualized to represent anything but their own determination and decency.The filmmakers are content to allow us to spend time with these people; they recognize the power of connection and compassion.Ordinariness-and [Jonathan] Olshefski\\'s ordinary, level-headed approach to documenting their life-is the keynote of this intensely moving and involving film.There is no grand narrative or point to be hammered home; instead, Olshefski delivers a subtle, sincere and honest portrait of barely making ends meet in modern America.\"Quest\" could very easily have been titled \"An American Family\" as well.Through eight years of filming ... the director discovers an everyday American story of extraordinary strength.Olshefski captures the frustration, resignation and determination that leaves you struck by this family -- average in their concerns but extraordinary in their dedication to one another.Quest speaks volumes about working-class life and the necessity of community, parenting, perseverance, speaking out, speaking up, hope.[An] extraordinary documentary.There are stretches of Quest that are tough to watch, and others you might never want to end.The randomness is what\\'s so stunning; one moment life is flowing placidly, then its course is cruelly changed.Christopher, Christine\\'a, and P.J. are beautiful to watch together, and there\\'s hope in witnessing them persevere - in an underserved neighborhood, against shifting political tides, beset by the random cruelties of fate.I\\'ve rarely seen a movie about citizenship as quietly eloquent as \"Quest.\"[A] tender, humane, gently probing film ...When the final credits roll, it\\'s heartening to know that people like the Raineys, the backbone of this country, are thriving in the face of great odds.... a quietly moving story of resilience.This is loving, humane, substantial stuff, with the richness of a fat novel rather than the sensationalism and cruelty of reality TV.It is a rare fly-on-the wall documentary that doesn\\'t generate some ethical dilemmas. Olshefski had chosen his subjects well.Amplifying these voices is the film\\'s definitive quest.Quest makes it clear that some things endure beyond political events. Step is the story of young girls who are beating the odds. After seeing it, I hope audiences remember these girls never should have had to face such odds in the first place.Rest assured audience members will be thinking about Step long after it\\'s over.There\\'s a slickness to this storytelling that makes everything feel slightly fraudulent, even if it isn\\'t. And yet I kind of loved it.No movie has lifted up my soul this year as much as this one has. No movie has had me crying tears of pure joy in quite the volume this one has.The portrait of the girls, their hard-up but loving parents (two are single mums, men being conspicuous by their absence) and the school staff egging them on is in turns saddening and lovely, the drama of their collective effort intensely moving.Step is a story about relationships. And how even the most challenging family ties shape us into the people we are destined to become.Director Amanda Lipitz takes viewers home with the students and creates palpable drama around their quests to attend college following their senior year.The film is perhaps not entirely candid about all the bad stuff backstage, and there are complex personal issues that are not entirely absorbed. But a very likable film.Inspiring and uplifting.Step is a superlative entrant into the particular modern genre of film-making known as: \"Tear-jerking and life-affirming documentary...\"What the film lacks in actual music and performance (only a snippet of Beyonc\\'s \"Formation\"?), it makes up for in intimate interviews with the Lethal Ladies and their mothers, who are doing their best to give their daughters a better life.There are quite a few moments in Step that will reduce you to mush, and not because Lipitz exploits those things that make life difficult for young Black women growing up in Baltimore, just blocks away from where Freddie Gray was killed.With her instincts as a storyteller, Lipitz emphasises the grimmer elements so that the pay-off is all the more gratifying.Lipitz\\'s irresistible crowd-pleaser deftly balances the kids\\' juggling act of heartaches at home and in school, their dedication on the dance floor and their determination to achieve success.One of the feel-good documentaries of the year.[A] taut, intimate, passionate, and celebratory documentary ...A straightforward, fly-on-the-wall portrait of real people struggling with real-life problems.What\\'s so inspiring about Step is its emphasis on the power of black sisterhood, especially in times of turmoil.Without a doubt one of the most genuinely moving, inspirational and thoroughly entertaining films of the year.Step is a powerful, must-see documentary that combines the raw intensity of a stellar documentary with the fierce dance of the best movie musical. Filmmakers Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles mostly let the couple\\'s routines and journeys paint their own emotionally dappled picture.Sweet without being sappy, the film extends an uncommon empathy to two characters that colder films (and, as we see, people) would treat as a punchline.Dina is a story about resilience and a woman\\'s indomitable will to seek out her best life.There are moments of humour in a gently affecting story that celebrates the ordinariness of its subjects.Co-directors Antonio Santini and Dan Sickles tell the story gracefully, doling out Dina\\'s tragic backstory in excellent increments.... the tableau-style presentation succeeds in embedding us with the film\\'s subjects, letting viewers see the bond between Dina and Scott that, although sometimes brittle, stubbornly endures.Sickles and Santini excel at constructing a respectful (but never cold or clinical) distance from their subject, using long takes to let her explain herself in her own words.Sickles and Santini\\'s documentary is intimate, unvarnished and hugely touching, finding universal truths in its two subjects\\' unconventional romance.Dina offers it\\'s audience far more than they bargained for without being moralising or predictable.Powerful film-making, executed with subtle style.Even if approached with more than a few misgivings, \"Dina\" is valuable if only to offer viewers an honest, touching, ultimately optimistic portrait of people embracing intimacy and honesty the best way they know how.It is a beautifully shot, coolly composed movie, in which the principals emerge as intensely likable and intelligent.A poignant snapshot of marginalised lives.[Antonio] Santini and [Dan] Sickles make us care deeply for Dina and Scott, so close is their access.Although there may be no fairy-tale endings, by the movie\\'s end it\\'s impossible not to wish one for Dina and Scott.It\\'s rare for filmmakers to get so close to any couple, but a special sort of caution comes with watching the lives of people whose view of the world might be far from our own.From the mundane to the eventful, the movie takes a fairly unflinching, yet respectful view of Dina and Scott\\'s world, which includes family, friends, hobbies, home life, trips, rituals and old Top 40 songs.The film is mostly happy to stay in its sweetly mundane lane, but not without keeping a couple dramatic and moving bumps waiting down the road.There are some extremely dark moments in Dina, and these are even more powerful because of Santini and Sickles\\' humanistic approach. Their care for Dina and Scott is clear in every frame.What redeems Dina is the fullness of the woman herself, who\\'s managed her disability and survived a mortal threat in order to open up to the possibility of a long-term relationship. Not your usual silver-screen documentary.A fascinating documentary about Hedy Lamarr, an extraordinary woman who was so much more than the moviegoing public ever imagined.It\\'s a reminder that, even for world-famous icons, it\\'s pointless to reduce people to a single piece of notoriety.Dean explores a fascinating life full of contradictions.Bombshell suffers from some common complaints of modern documentary -- too much music; unnecessary, if perfectly decent, animated sequences -- but it does remind us of a class of personality that doesn\\'t exist anymore.Lamarr was an enigma: a great brain trapped in a silly, spurious image of glamour, while her real talent was allowed to wither. A sad but fascinating story.If her story, however, is even vaguely familiar (made nude flick, was brainy, did inventions, made glamour flicks, stayed brainy, had lots of plastic surgery, died) then this will be a very ho-hum trawl.It\\'s a proper story alright, and a fascinating one.It is no hagiography: even Lamarr\\'s own children are open about her flaws. But Dean treats her subject with respect as a great mind; something rarely afforded to Lamarr by her male contemporaries in life.A vivid portrait of one of the most remarkable, pioneering women of Hollywood\\'s Golden Age.It may be the best \"not just a pretty face\" story in the history of the world.A life story packed with incident means that this sometimes rushes past events that would be formative for anyone else, but equally means that Lamarr\\'s life story is never, ever dull.The movie reveals and demonstrates over and over that Lamarr was a fascinating and brilliant person, a true eccentric with considerable will and personal courage.A Google animator puts the mystery of Hedy Lamarr best: \\'She\\'s a perfect underdog, crime-fighter-by-night story.\\' Here she is, unmasked at last.An entertaining, and at times heartbreaking and infuriating, film.Ultimately stands as a tragedy of what might have been and never came to be, for both its subject and for us.There is plenty for the film buff to enjoy...There is poignant film of Lamarr in her later years when she became a recluse, and a cheering finish with the ceremony at which her discovery was finally acknowledged.It\\'s a fascinating story, if one that has been told before.It fascinates both as film history and as a sobering reminder of how little credit a woman like Lamarr received, even at the peak of her popularity.A documentary that follows Lamarr\\'s tumultuous life, tracking a life in which her beauty served to obscure her brains, although her brains persevered. Hypnotic and illuminating.For the last half-century, Wiseman has never stopped looking outward. But this could be his unwitting self-portrait.Nonetheless, this is a fascinating and painstaking piece of work which provides an extraordinarily thorough picture of its subject.If only all study sessions were as enchanting as this.There are so many wonderful activities of compassion that Wiseman captures that my heart burst about a dozen times (a conservative estimate).Three-hours-plus is an absurd amount of time to sit through the visual equivalent of thumbing through the NYPL\\'s program guide.Ultimately Ex Libris demonstrates that libraries are about people, and what gives the film its great and accumulating force is that people are infinitely complex.It\\'s fascinating, if overlong. \"Ex Libris\" is the kind of film that makes you realize what wonders we too often take for granted, and how much work and passion go into such wonders.Ex Libris proves that the idea of the library is still going strong, though the idea of \"the public\" may be another matter.As with all of Wiseman\\'s films, the whole is so very much greater than the sum of its parts.\"Ex Libris\" is a profoundly hopeful movie. We could use that right now.Maybe one temple of learning will inspire a visit to another: see the movie, then pop into your local biblioteca.The democracy of his filmmaking is, as ever, striking; this is one of our most American artists, and \\'Ex Libris\\' is the very definition of what he does well.\"Ex Libris: The New York Public Library\" is more than a magisterial mash note to that distinguished establishment, it\\'s a heartening examination of the vastness of human knowledge and the multiple ways we the people endeavor to access it.This is slow, almost languid filmmaking, yet it\\'s a delight to watch the countless ways in which the library is still capable of lifting us.If this world has you in need of a little healing time, go, go, go and see it: it\\'s a lovely, gracious, soul-satisfying thing.Ex Libris\\'s graceful exit suggests that Wiseman always knew exactly where he was headed.One would be quite wrong to regard Frederick Wiseman as a mere observer, rather than the agent-provocateur he is.[An] endearing shaggy dog of a documentary.The huge canvas becomes an inadvertent self-portrait of this most self-effacing of auteurs, whom one senses entirely shares the NYPL\\'s noble aims and belief in the power of education, community and hard work. An eye opener in every senseIn its own way, \"The Last Laugh\" is a celebration of Jewish humor, not just its importance as a survival technique, but also just how much it has shaped our culture.Is laughter a palliative? The only weapon of the powerless? Perhaps significantly, the film ends in tears.At a time when many of us look to comedy to keep us sane, the question is especially pertinent, although the answers here aren\\'t especially penetrating.At times haphazard but always involving ...Ferne Pearlstein\\'s The Last Laugh is a rather safe and genteel documentary about the limits of humor (especially as they pertain to the Holocaust), but it opens with a subtly provocative sequence of events that\\'s hard to shake.What\\'s fascinating is the difference in perspectives.[An] insightfully open-ended inquiry into the role of humor as it relates to unspeakable tragedy.There are a lot of fascinating flashes.That there\\'s a big difference between Nazi jokes and Holocaust jokes is one of the insights gleaned from Ferne Pearlstein\\'s documentary concerning taboos in comedy, especially those concerning that generally forbidden topic.The mix of levity, serious themes, marquee names and archival materials in Ferne Pearlstein\\'s entertaining, thought-provoking documentary should find primarily broadcast buyers in numerous markets.That\\'s a lot of ground to cover, and the end product is a little scattershot. But it\\'s always compelling.Some will be disappointed by the lack of firm conclusions in this film, but if it reveals anything, it\\'s the intensely personal nature of what people find funny. [Peter Bratt] deftly edits together archival footage and interviews with Huerta\\'s children, co-workers, collaborators, and Huerta herself. He backs it with a jazz and salsa soundtrack and tells the story with zest and clarity.It\\'s a powerful, provocative filmmaking that could potentially inspire a new generation of Dolores Huertas.[An] essential documentary.Using powerful archive material, the film chronicles Huerta\\'s life and triumphs.Modern US history gets a bracing rewrite with Dolores...With Dolores, we\\'re getting the lesson we deserve.What\\'s clear is that after watching Dolores, this woman becomes an unforgettable figure in the annals of Mexican-American history...Hagiographic but still lively and informative, this documentary by Peter Bratt shines a spotlight on a historic, relatively overlooked figure...\"Dolores\" is a fascinating corrective to 50-plus years of American history. It\\'s educational, to be sure, but also exhilarating, inspiring and deeply emotional.Her social activism often left her children, some of whom are interviewed, in the lurch. It\\'s a contradiction the film could have more sharply explored.\"Dolores\" is a documentary that celebrates a hero, but it\\'s no hagiography. Its subject wouldn\\'t stand for that.Bratt and his collaborators clearly admire their subject, while recognizing that the struggles and some possible contradictions don\\'t make her a weaker leader.Huerta is such a commanding figure, and the array of historical footage marshalled on behalf of her story is so impressive, that the film makes a strong impression.As a girl, she says, she had wanted to be a dancer. In some way you can see that in her work: She has made activism an art form.Bratt masterfully corrects the record ... revealing a charismatic, complicated woman who persevered - despite the disruption to her family and swirling disapproval of her personal life.Peter Bratt\\'s documentary sharply trumpets Dolores Huerta\\'s life and centrality in the turbulent history of social justice since the \\'60s.With any luck, Dolores will move the needle, enlightening viewers about the formidable Huerta and raising awareness of her rightful place in civil rights history.Bratt fleshes her out in fullest political and social dimension, but also captures her personal life and driven personality.\"Dolores\" crams a great deal of information, themes, and diverse archival materials into a sharp, cogent whole ... Elsa Dorfman\\'s work is ephemeral yet grand: using a giant 20\" x 24\" camera, that is now discontinued, Dorfman has produced some of the world\\'s largest Polaroid images, showing that unwieldy technology does not need to be limiting when used imaginatively.[Elsa] Dorfman\\'s a fascinating character whose sunny demeanor, much like her generally cheerful photos, contains hidden depths.Morris\\' film also functions as an elegy for Polaroid and the large-format imagery that has now ceased to exist as a result of the company\\'s demise.Dorfman ... makes for a lively and loquacious subject ...More than any of Morris\\'s films, The B-Side is directly about the mystery of capturing a person\\'s identity on film...This likeable close-up portrait may not be one of his most substantial films, but it\\'s his most likeable and most casual.There\\'s a lot more movie contained within this charming oddity, but only for those who are willing to look deeper.A fine-grained (no photography pun intended) look at the way that the development of an artist\\'s style is usually intertwined with the technology and materials that she chooses to embrace.Clocking in at a trim 76 minutes, The B-side is as warmly affectionate as its subject, a close friend and neighbor of the director.[An] enjoyable but also profound movie.You can almost sense Morris smiling off-camera as she pulls each exposure from her file drawers for reminiscing and newfound scrutiny - that\\'s how strong and warm his admiration is for Dorfman and the humble richness of her work.Endearing and significant.Even at only 76 minutes, The B-Side feels a tad overextended-but it\\'s a pleasure to see a warm, creative, and not even remotely evasive individual in front of [Morris\\'] signature Interrotron camera for a change.If Errol Morris\\' new film is a relatively minor work by his standards, then its bittersweet, faintly lilting tone is here to remind viewers of the big heart that\\'s always been there in his oeuvre.Errol Morris films Dorfman and her work with a rapt attentiveness that maps the nostalgic and regretful stirrings of her soul.This film will convince you that she definitely deserves a higher position in the pantheon.The depth of her art reflects a life richly lived, as does the wisdom of her epigrammatic musings.If this doc is sometimes elegiac in tone, there is nothing mournful about it.Her stories are great, especially the one about Dorfman gate-crashing Dylan\\'s Rolling Thunder Revue in 1975. It would have been nice to hear more of them.[Morris\\'] film makes for a fittingly positive monument to [Dorfman\\'s] often overlooked and under-appreciated work, but this intimate conversation and reflection also allows him to also do so much more.It\\'s a film with much to say, about the shifting winds of technology, the challenges of art that stands the tests of time, and how we choose to think about the lives we\\'ve lived. A touching and poetic portrait of a pair of imperfect people, forever transformed by the vices of success, the big city and other all-too-human temptations.I Called Him Morgan is a first-rate documentary. It\\'s also the perfect impetus to explore Morgan\\'s catalogue.Collin\\'s exceptional, atmospheric film avoids the hysteria and hyperbole of similar true crime documentaries to usher this delicate story in with a palpable sense of sorrow rather than a desire to retroactively point the finger of justice.Ultimately, Collin\\'s film is one of forgiveness.\"I Called Him Morgan\" works as a jazz documentary as well as a bizarre true crime tale about a mysterious crime of passion. All these years later, many questions remain.Much of these details could be found on Morgan\\'s extensive Wikipedia page, and they don\\'t do much to explain why a movie was essential.Collin\\'s approach to this incendiary material is both blatant and oblique - a bit like Lee\\'s playing itself. Thankfully, we hear quite a bit of that playing in the film.Morgan\\'s relationship with Helen was so star-crossed and layered it\\'s a mystery why the story hasn\\'t yet been made into a biopic.There was no escaping the profound loss experienced on that evening, turning I Called Him Morgan into a musical story of sorrow and regret that plays as if its abrupt, agonizing outcome blindsided everyone, even if it was never really in doubt.I couldn\\'t have anticipated that Swedish filmmaker Kasper Collin would provide such a personal and moving portrait of the musician, who died at age 33. You don\\'t have to love jazz to be drawn into this remarkable storyMusicians sometimes paraphrase Debussy, or one another, in saying that music is the silence between the notes. I Called Him Morgan has it all -- the notes and the silence, plus the music of spoken language, pitched in rueful tones of recollection.Using a dazzling blend of cinematic tools, aural as well as visual, Collin recreates both individual lives and an entire world.Collin ... hasn\\'t quite found the sweet spot here between true crime and musical biography, but the story that plays out in \"Morgan\" is still an intriguing one.The interview-\"an amazing document,\" Collin says-enriches the documentary and transforms it into a story within the story.A bittersweet documentary about the woman who saved a jazz legend\\'s life, and then killed him.I Called Him Morgan evokes times and places, and the sorrows and joys of the jazz life in those times and places, with real integrity.This is not a lurid true-crime tale of jealousy and drug addiction, but a delicate human drama about love, ambition and the glories of music.\"Morgan\" will be heaven for jazz aficionados, but those who don\\'t know the difference between bebop and hard bop won\\'t feel lost. Collin understands that his film is about people, not art, but his deft storytelling flexes its own nimbleness and beauty.All we have are the known facts, and that is all that I Called Him Morgan provides in the end.[Lee Morgan\\'s] life was as colorful and tragic. His talent as deep. This enlightening and haunting documentary gives him his due. Schwarz and Clusiau also come across as glib storytellers, cutting impatiently between several different stories and presenting them in bite-size chunks, as in a TV news broadcast.Trophy should be mandatory viewing in spite of its narrative presentation.The film gives voice to the commercial case for breeding and hunting, which feels at odds with the emotive way these kills are positioned.If \\'Blue Planet II\\' is a bit too touchy-feely for you, this hard-hitting doc should do the trick.A powerful film, but also sometimes very tough to watch.Shaul Schwarz and Christina Clusiau\\'s disturbing documentary digs into the murk of the African big-game trade with candour and even-handedness.It\\'s a film to raise your blood pressure.Trophy doesn\\'t tell you which side to pick; it\\'s content to show you what they are.To its credit, \"Trophy\" neither shames its subjects nor offers an easy solution.Trophy presents the very definition of making a deal with the devil.Trophy instead holds its subject right up to the light, like a diamond, so that all facets can be seen. It may not rouse the public to action, but it will give us something to ponder.[An] alternately alarming and frustrating film ...A brilliant, maddening, necessary movie.Trophy is a documentary that can make the stomach turn and the head spin.The intimacy of the film\\'s images and the surprising candor of its participants are disarming: Whatever your initial response, be prepared to re-evaluate.The movie is richer in every way for its tangled sympathies. It will leave you angry, sick, and confused - but not smug.This is no simple tale of bad hunter vs. innocent wild animal.What\\'s abundantly clear is that every other species on Earth is at our mercy, and that there are no easy answers when it comes to determining the most compassionate form of our so-called dominion.it goes a long way toward complicating our moral assumptions about trophy hunting, as well as a host of other wildlife issues, including conservation, poaching, rhino farms, and the proper balance between man and nature.Trophy is an extraordinary accomplishment, for its nuanced presentation of a very tangled issue but more importantly for its gorgeous, wrenching footage of what happens when an American pays to kill an African animal. Like his previous film, Valentino: The Last Emperor, about the famous fashion designer, director Matt Tyrnauer takes on a fascinating subject yet mostly consolidates existing information without adding much to our knowledge base.A timely warning against big-block buildings with empty ground-floor shop units, nonetheless.Tyrnauer uses a ton of archival footage to tell his story, and brings it in at a brisk 92 minutes.She was also one tough cookie who appreciated a good fight. A bit more internal tussle would have both better honored her spirit and made for a better documentary.Most good documentaries are powered by conflict, and you couldn\\'t ask for a struggle more elemental or relevant to our time than the one chronicled in Citizen Jane: Battle for the City.A celebration of grassroots activism and a cry for community, this should appeal to those interested in the history and politics of urbanisation as well as architecture nerds.As a David and Goliath story, the film is hugely entertaining.Jacobs\\' unrelenting thirst for change stays with you.As the world\\'s urban population grows by more than one million every week, so does the resonance of this documentary about a New Yorker who campaigned in the 1960s against the inhuman and brutal scale of new housing.The movie is scored like a thriller, seemingly building to some terrifying conclusion. And, in a way, it does ...[A] bracing, invigorating documentary.Movies thrive on the clash of titans, and in Matt Tyrnauer\\'s new documentary Citizen Jane: Battle for the City we have a peach.In the context of today\\'s stymied political trench wars, there is inspiration to be found in Jacobs\\' example of local activism, original thinking, and rational argument blossoming into useful change.A fascinating and surprisingly dramatic and topical affair.Anyone seeking a demonstration of how completely orthodoxy and heresy can change places need look no further than the brisk documentary \"Citizen Jane: Battle for the City.\"It\\'s a complicated tale, and at 92 minutes, the film is a very brief summary. But it\\'s a story that needs telling, as Tyrnauer proves ...Citizen Jane takes on an invigorating richness as it delves into issues of sexism (Jacobs, a respected journalist, was often painted by her foes as an angry mother), economic despair and the complex idea of the \"master builder.\"Jacobs argued that what looks to officialdom like disorder is actually what makes a crowded human landscape function - it\\'s just a more complex order. This compelling documentary lets you see the beauty she found in that complexity.[A] gorgeous, tightly written and entertaining film.It\\'s a story that needs periodic retelling, and Mr. Tyrnauer has heightened the human drama by focusing on Jacobs, an improbable David to Moses\\'s Goliath. By making it clear that those who find themselves in these situations are all ordinary people just like us, Ai Weiwei brings home the sheer, unthinkable monstrousness of their predicament.Its dazzling drone photography sends you gliding over vast expanses of ocean and desert yet the film itself leads to the inescapable conclusion that the world is shrinking.What he shows us is tragic and horrifying, but he offers no possible solutions and nothing much in the way of analysis.Through brief but intimate exchanges, Ai brings the individuals behind the statistics into focus.Beautifully filmed testimonies that tear at your soul.The scattershot and lengthy documentary doesn\\'t attempt to be a news report...but the cumulative impact of its often haunting images brings home the plight of millions of the world\\'s people.Difficult, but hugely important film-making.Ai Weiwei\\'s magnificent documentary stands as a companion piece to the BBC\\'s series, Exodus: Our Journey To Europe.An ambitious, humane and often shocking cine-essay on the subject of migrants and the 21st century migrant condition.Although maybe a little naive in places, this is an unflinching record of a cry of anguish that has to be heard and acted upon. Everyone needs to see this.Weiwei turns feature documentarist to portray the global landslide - the molten movement of human masses - that is today\\'s historical moment and reality.The imagery encourages viewers to adopt a global perspective in considering the subject matter.It does not browbeat or preach, it simply shows, and what it shows is overwhelming.Ai\\'s film becomes more digressive than discursive. Rather than contending with the information saturation around the crisis, Human Flow falls prey to it. Footage is layered without clear logic, poetic or narrative.We never remain long enough with any one person to get more than a cursory idea of their story, and so over the course of the film\\'s 140 minute runtime, we end up with a sense of the crisis as a tragedy, yes, but a choral, abstract one.The film is all the more powerful for being so calm and unhurried. Ai doesn\\'t castigate or preach. He doesn\\'t have to. The facts, the images, speak for themselves. Instead, he bears witness.Ai Weiwei has made something beautiful: Human Flow is neither indulgent nor pedantic, but clear-eyed in its view of the enormity of the crisis too vast for most of us to comprehend.An artful, solemn globe-hop epic of the refugee crisis with an unfortunate cast of millions.Solutions would be welcome, but it\\'s not really the fault of the film for not having the answers. Human Flow at least opens the tap for global inspection.Weiwei doesn\\'t break any new ground in covering the global refugee crisis, but he vividly illustraes - in straightforward yet artistic terms - the scale of the problem without compromising the dignity or humanity of the survivors. The personalities make the picture, and James\\' camera presence is such that \"Abacus\" never seems to gin up or theatricalize anyone\\'s thoughts or behavior.... deceptively straightforward new film from Hoop Dreams director Steve James.\"Abacus\" is probably the only film made in the past decade that could get an audience rooting for a bank, but it does just that.When Steve James\\'s documentary suggests that Abacus was the victim of a concerted Establishment plot... it doesn\\'t have quite enough evidence for a conviction, but it is an absorbing study of the court case, the bank and Chinatown itself.A sweet and sometimes moving, if ultimately minor, film about a hopelessly inadequate fraud case from 2012.Disarmingly human moments - the Sung daughters, all high-powered lawyers, fret over their 80-year-old father\\'s disappointing sandwich - pepper this compelling courtroom drama.Yet again, it is a story of the fat cats and the thin cats - and a reminder of how Milton Friedman\\'s maxim applies to the bank bailouts: socialism for the rich, free enterprise for the poor.Using drawings and courtroom testimony, James creates a tense courtroom drama out of seemingly dry material.The film works at once as a compelling, tangled legal story, a depiction of Chinatown\\'s world within a world, and a portrait of those who live there and shape it as they try to bridge the gap between one world and the other.Steve James\\'s impressively economical documentary folds together the events that led to the case, the place of Abacus in the Chinese-American community, the 2015 trial, and its aftermath.It\\'s not every day that you end up rooting for a bank, but the story \"Abacus: Small Enough to Jail\" tells is no ordinary tale.The lack of action is made up for by the gumption of the accused banking family, whose respect for each other is apparent even as they bicker and interrupt each other over trial strategy, press releases and the catered lunch.The film\\'s director, who would make an excellent character witness for the defence, raises ... questions but frustratingly doesn\\'t answer them in an otherwise compelling documentary.As gripping as the movie is as a legal thriller, it\\'s even more notable as a portrait of a community.The film persuasively argues that any fraud at Abacus occurred at a low level, and that the bank dealt with it swiftly and properly.Abacus: Small Enough to Jail is a compelling non-fiction thriller. It should engross most viewers, even those who\\'ve resisted learning what a subprime mortgage is.James\\' essentially humanist mode of documentary filmmaking can\\'t cut through the surface of the surface.Steve James\\'s film is a rallying cry, and its weaknesses as art might bolster its strength as reformatory theater.James spins a fascinating and complex web involving lies, fraud, a months-long trial with a hung jury, and cultural biases against Abacus and the immigrant Chinese community it serves.Abacus: Small Enough To Jail isn\\'t as grand or engrossing a treatise as Hoop Dreams or The Interrupters, but in its intimate, well-observed way, the film is deeply moving and subtly shaming. On top of being entertaining, illuminating, and affecting, the film is beautifully shot -- with gorgeous, hazy light and painterly framing -- it looks like a narrative feature.There is honesty in All This Panic that is both relatable and somewhat shocking, and for female viewers in their 20s and 30s especially, these girls are recognizable and sympathetic.All This Panic is a movie that captures the spirit of being a young woman on the verge.The result is a pensive, gorgeous meditation on what it means to grow up.[Filmmakers Jenny Gage and Tom Betterton] got close to them as Brooklyn neighbors and spent three years following them as they matured and began to separate from parents and forge their own identities.Adopting a meandering, free-flowing structure and woozily intimate photography, the director, Jenny Gage, and her husband, the cinematographer Tom Betterton, follow close and listen well.Gage makes each minute boldly and deeply matter.A composite portrait of girlhood, refracted - not especially rich in groundbreaking insight, but often shimmering with feeling.There\\'s no judgment to be found here, only an unvarnished look at its subjects struggling to figure out who they are, what they want, and how they might achieve their goals.Gage\\'s singular, gendered focus is refreshing; simply offering these young women a platform in which to articulate their immature but still perceptive worldview carries some inherent value.A wisp of a thing at 79 minutes, the film punches above its weight when it comes to quietly life-changing insights into the tricky business of growing up.This intimate, revelatory documentary about the lives of seven teenage girls in Brooklyn, New York, was shot over three years by Jenny Gage and her cinematographer husband, Tom Betterton.You will, I promise, be profoundly moved.Affirms what we have suspected: fun in the social networking age - web one-upmanship, wars of esteem and self-esteem - has become fraught, even neurotic.It may not tell you that much - or perhaps anything - new. But the girls\\' personalities come across with great clarity.Compelling material that never quite comes of age.Yes, the premise is a bit threadbare but this is an intimate, lyrical documentary that offers a subtly effective snapshot of life as a young woman on the threshold of adulthood.More remarkable for the way it looks than the actual, somewhat banal, girl-talk content.All This Panic will make you feel all the feels-excitement, confusion, sadness, anger, pining, and certainly all this panic-and heighten them to teen levels.It\\'s a marvelous, absorbing film, with truth vibrating through frame after frame. \"Obit\" manages to be both about a specific type of journalism and the larger world it reflects while dropping in all manner of colorful lives and circumstances.The real subject here is storytelling, the creation of a stylish, authoritative, highly personal record of \"how the world got to be the way it is.\" One more thing to miss about newspapers when they go.As someone who takes great pleasure in both reading and writing valedictions to the recently deceased, I can personally attest that the movie\\'s dead on.It is fascinating to watch the writers in \"Obit\" strive to do right by their subjects, warts and all.These folks are neither dour nor sappy; they are just talented journalists who want to do right by the people who left their mark on the world.Vanessa Gould\\'s brisk, affectionate documentary Obit suggests that obituary writing as practiced by the ace team at The New York Times could be the most imaginative and organic form of journalism in contemporary newspapers.A fascinating look at the way in which these memorials function as not only tributes to fascinating, influential, idiosyncratic lives, but also as crucial records about our society and culture.The people brought to life here, using a combination of the written obituary and news clips, are a varied and fascinating bunch.Writing an evocative, compact, accurate obituary is an art, and Vanessa Gould\\'s joyous documentary Obit takes us on a tour of the joint where some of the best are written ...It is abundantly clear that Obit was made by someone who, to paraphrase featured obituarist Bruce Weber, has encountered death before and knows how to approach the subject with compassion.Readers of the New York Times are bound to enjoy an inside look at one of the paper\\'s most dependably enthralling sections.Do something memorable, and do it fast. Obit implies that the obituary page, like everything else, is fast becoming a dying art.Entertaining if a bit conventional in its anecdotal structure and slightly cutesy tone, these 95 minutes should appeal to the same public that happily spends half the day reading the Sunday Times ...One comes away from \"Obit\" grateful that the paper has at its disposal a team of humane, gifted people who make commemorating the dead a lively, lasting art.Obit rarely strays from the anodyne tone of the advertorial.The film ascribes to a conventionally contrapuntal take on the lives of those who spend all day surrounded by death.OBIT, the new documentary from director Vanessa Gould, lingers at the newspaper\\'s death-desk to think through the meaning of remembrance, and to show the workday of these uncommon journalists.Gould secures plenty of nuts-and-bolts detail about the reporting and writing process, which can range from novelistic use of detail to the prosaic but no less critical matter of confirming the death itself.Documentarian Vanessa Gould leads her viewer by the hand through the day in a life of the darling weirdos at The New York Times obituary desk.Obit is a fascinating, if slightly too long, look at newspaper journalism in general and obituaries in particular. This gentle, positive treatment of Rogers coincides with the show\\'s values but devalues his enormous social importance.This documentary by Morgan Neville reveals that he really was just what he seemed to be at first innocent sight: a kind-hearted, square but saintly man who genuinely loved and understood children in a pure, sincere way.Not beyond reproach, but a fitting tribute to a pop culture icon.The film evokes a range of emotions befitting a childhood lesson on feelings.You don\\'t need to have grown up with [Rogers] to be fascinated and moved by Morgan Neville\\'s documentary portrait, made in a spirit of admiration, which on the evidence presented here seems well-deserved.Fred Rogers did walk this earth, every single morning entering through a wooden door on PBS. And while doing so, he spoke to our softer warmer core.The kindness and compassion the documentary displays for its subject, and which Fred Rogers in turn extended to generations of children, help make Won\\'t You Be My Neighbor? one of the best of the year.It\\'s daunting, particularly when we feel we are in the shadow of figures like him, who are seemingly capable of such impossible good.One of the better documentaries I\\'ve seen in a long time. Terrific.Indeed, going forward, I\\'m going to ask myself: What Would Fred Rogers Do?A poignant tribute to the mild-mannered father-figure who served as moral compass to generations.An essential piece of filmmaking excellence viewers of all backgrounds, ethnicities, cultures and political persuasions owe it to themselves to see at the earliest possible opportunity.\"Won\\'t You Be My Neighbor?\" doesn\\'t deify Rogers, but it makes a strong argument that as a neighbor, he was one of a kind.This timely doc will resonate deeply with anyone who remembers Rogers befriending them from the small screen.As Oscar winner Morgan Neville\\'s timely, tear-duct lubricating documentary \"Won\\'t You Be My Neighbor?\" makes clear, the easily parodied, often underestimated icon of children\\'s television was a total badass.We don\\'t have celebrities like [Fred Rogers] anymore.The question is not did you cry, but rather how many times and when.Won\\'t You Be My Neighbor? offers us some hope; Rogers\\'s approach, the film seems to say, can be unexpectedly powerful.At a time when tolerance and compassion often seem to be under siege, \"Won\\'t You Be My Neighbor?\" reminds us that the softest voices often have the strongest impact.Poignantly recalling that time of life when we were first learning how to be our best selves, the film unstridently reminds us that the work doesn\\'t stop once we grow up and out of the neighborhood. Though it runs just 93 minutes, this cinema-verite documentary by Bing Liu manages to feel like an epic.It will warm your heart but possibly break it a little too.This is a movie about what people are prepared to swallow when they\\'re thirsty for love.Liu documents his friends\\' fitful steps towards adulthood. He explores the way that violence can write itself into the DNA of a community, recurring in subsequent generations.Powerful. Very insightful because it\\'s so intimate.It is impossibly gripping, terribly personal, but always compassionate.The ruthless manner in which he has hacked a decade\\'s worth of footage into 93 taut minutes alone qualified him for Oscar consideration.It\\'s as if all its director Bing Liu had to do was put the idea for his film at the top of a steep hill, give it a prod, then keep filming as natural forces took care of the rest.Each boy is likeable, troubled, searching, and hypnotically watchable in the way he puts his features on record, dimly conscious that his feelings are playing those features like a needle on a disc.This is a fluent, watchable piece of work, though not quite as lucid as it might have been.Its skating sequences are impressive, but it\\'s the intimate examinations of fracturing friendships and emerging adulthood that make Minding The Gap surprisingly resonant.A profound study of youth, adulthood and the space in between.It soon becomes apparent that all three of them are struggling to become adults while dealing with the legacies of childhoods devastated by family violence.The ambition of Minding the Gap is a bit beyond the reach of Liu. It may be that only a dramatic film artist could have done justice to this subject. But as a piece of cinematic self-therapy, fragmented though it is, it has few rivals.Minding the Gap becomes less a story about the ad hoc fraternity of skateboarders and more about the fractured home life that sends them looking for a surrogate family.The skateboarding footage is pretty stunning in its gracefulness ... a thrilling diversion from all the trouble we\\'re witnessing, just as it is for the subjects themselves.The score by Nathan Halpern and Chris Ruggiero is sparse and beautiful and perfect. The editing is brilliant.Much of \"Minding the Gap\" is painful to witness, but as past and present intersect and recombine and Liu\\'s wealth of footage coalesces, the finished film becomes a cautiously hopeful and even cathartic experience.It\\'s the movie Liu was born to make, the one he had to get off his chest before he could move on in his filmmaking career.In a world full of images...Bing\\'s movie stands out for the complexity of its integrity, and its ability to reveal his own experiences empathically. The clich?? \"stranger than fiction\" is probably used a little too freely, but this really is that.It combines interviews, archive footage and dramatic reconstructions to take us as close in to the story as possible, not coming to any conclusions. You won\\'t be able to look away.This haunting documentary uncovers as much of the truth as is possible.Dramatises the nature vs nurture argument in a murky and intriguing way. If only its stylistic mannerisms didn\\'t threaten to obscure the storytelling.It was a story that was really well told... very engrossing.It never loses sight of the three scarred subjects at the core of the tale, and of the sense of profound injustice inflicted on blameless children. Unmissable.[A] spry, endlessly watchable documentary...Entertaining and stimulating as it generally is, Wardle\\'s film keeps bumping its head on a ceiling, conceptually speaking.Three Identical Strangers raises more questions than it answers... But perhaps that\\'s a whole other documentary.A story that effortlessly segues from feel-good to tragedy to full-blown conspiracy. Even the reenactments ... are carefully and economically used.Director Wardle and his team have an astonishing story to tell. They tackle it in relatively conventional and restrained fashion with talking head interviews, one or two dramatic reconstructions and clever use of archive.This amazing story is told with patient thoroughness by Wardle.It is as gripping as a first-contact sci-fi.Putting aside that need for clarity (and many viewers may be fine with what it presents), Three Identical Strangers is one of the most entertaining documentaries in years.Like Morris\\'s work, the film has an abstract side as well as a concrete one, carrying a unique story to a point where broader philosophical issues open up.Three Identical Strangers is something worth seeing, but it\\'s not going to have you talking about it the next day.The less you know about Three Identical Strangers going in the better. It\\'s utterly captivating-an OMG story that truly has to be seen to be believed-but I do wish it had dug just a bit deeper.An engrossing, heartbreaking journey.Zooms in on the nature versus nurture question that has entranced, irritated and boggled humans for centuries.A documentary with a story so outlandish it might well have been rejected by a Hollywood studio had a screenwriter pitched it as the basis of a fictional movie. This is a visually powerful, emotionally draining documentary.McQueen\\'s great legacy is the beauty and skill that lay beneath the compulsion to outrage.What keeps McQueen from being a brilliant doco is its willingness to skim over the darkest parts of the designer\\'s life.McQueen is an honest study of a tragic genius.\"McQueen\" doesn\\'t even have to try to make the case for McQueen\\'s brilliance. It\\'s all there, right on the screen; this dude was artistically bonkers in all the right ways.It\\'s as close as most of us will ever get to a McQueen original.[The directors] would have done well to shear away the obscuring frills of polite encomiums and pay more attention to the structural details of both the man and what he made.Utilizing Michael Nyman\\'s... magnificent score with pinpoint precision, the filmmakers infuse their film with an urgent vibrancy that\\'s positively transfixing.McQueen is a haunting biography that goes beyond even that live runway experience to conjure the visionary himself, in as much as he may ever be known - and in a way even his savagely beautiful clothes themselves cannot.If you have any intention of seeing \"McQueen\" make sure you see it in a theater for full effect.A savagely beautiful tribute that the late, irreverent fashion designer Alexander McQueen would surely have appreciated.\"McQueen\" makes the case that its subject was an artist whose clay was clothing. It also, despite giving short shrift to psychoanalysis, reminds us that everything you might want to know about the artist can be found in the art.\"McQueen\" is an intriguing look at genius, its inspiration and ultimately its cost.McQueen sates audiences\\' desires to hear about the man\\'s origins, the mania that fueled his creations, and his ultimate downward spiral, but it only ever feels like a pattern waiting to be sewn together.Maybe now is the right moment-and McQueen, despite its shortcomings, the right film-to reheat [this] debate.Those closest to [McQueen] seem content to make peace with the dueling spirits inside him, even if he could not.The film\\'s methods are familiar, but accordingly satisfying.Formally traditional, and guided by a respectful approach to a complicated man. It\\'s lovingly told, even as it refuses to gloss over ugliness.This doc on the late designer Alexander McQueen is a ravishing, haunting portrait of a fashion-shock genius. , haunting and a must-seeIf nothing else, \"McQueen\" is a staggeringly beautiful piece of filmmaking. This awe-inspiring National Geographic documentary is as much a celebration of U.S. parks and wilderness as it is a record of one of the most audacious feats in the history of mountaineering.The visuals are stunning, offering head-spinning views with the comfort of total safety.Free Solo...is a jaw-dropper, both in what is documented and its visual impact.A visually dizzying but also thought-provoking film about one man\\'s pinnacle of achievement.I just got so swept up in it all. I love hearing what others are so passionate about. Completely taken by Alex\\'s story.Impressive... But the question for me remains: Why on earth would anybody do this?This is most definitely a film to see on the big cinema screen - unless, of course, you suffer from vertigo.There is something epic and disturbing about Honnold\\'s singularity, his desire to be the one person on the planet who can do something that no one else can.It\\'s worth seeing on the biggest screen you can find.It\\'s scary and exhilarating stuff.Is it strange when the wholehearted pursuit of a singular and spectacular achievement inspires pity and fear more than awe?The vast, sublime shots of Honnold framed by trees and valleys far, far below, are simply magic. Terrifying, but magic.The deftly captured footage of Honnold\\'s preparation with ropes (he falls often), and his execution without, is consistently difficult to watch without flinching. I barely exhaled for the duration of the film.This is daring, dangerous and dizzying stuff, the story of a one man simultaneously in competition and cooperation with nature. Meet Tom Cruise\\'s hero, probably.A mountain\\'s mass and a man\\'s resolve become symbiotically overpowering.I spent most of this film with my jaw on the floor.It\\'s an amazing piece of cinema.A geological love letter to manspreading.Free Solo is about getting dangerously close to the edge, where some people feel most alive. We get to experience that thrill secondhand, and that\\'s enough.This plays out with as much (or more) suspense than any conventional thriller as the cameras capture every step of Alex\\'s ascent. An irresistible mix of insouciance and precocious maturity. Much of its charm lies in Tan\\'s ironic irreverence as the film\\'s narrator.What Tan has given us is an incredible, sui generis tribute to the international lingua franca of D.I.Y. cinempowerment.It\\'s a charming, wistful movie, and I trust Tan will not have to wait another 20 years to direct her next film.The movie is many things at once.On one level, Shirkers is a memoir - a fond, self-deprecating mulling-over of Tan\\'s crazy, inspired, partly embarrassing but furiously creative youth.Deeply personal, fabulously engrossing.Tan\\'s doc is wide awake to her lost movie\\'s resonance, as film meta-history ellipsis, as personal coming-of-age saga, and as \"a time capsule of Singapore, both real and imagined\".Out of the ashes of the original Shirkers rose the documentary Shirkers, every bit as exceptional as its forebear sought to be.A movie that maintains its forward momentum all the while it\\'s looking back.A knotty detective yarn, a funny valentine to Singapore and one of the year\\'s most ardent expressions of movie love, it tells a story of cinematic theft, and in the process, becomes an entrancing feat of cinematic reclamation.A joyfully idiosyncratic memoir of a joyfully idiosyncratic-looking film and its maker.It sends you wondering at all the wild creativity and genius of young irrepressible women lost to time, held up or buried by the domineering egos of men.With fascinating bravery, Tan goes backward in time in order to move toward a rectified future, confronting the memory of her complex, near-inappropriate relationship with Cardona, both an enabler and a betrayer.There is a sense of relief at the end of the documentary that feels like the first big breath of fresh air after stepping out of a therapist\\'s office.What we - and Tan - come to find is that how the director describes or sees herself in the past doesn\\'t always match up to her collaborators\\' opinions of the time; this is also a story about the stories we tell ourselves.A strange, warm and winding tale of movie love and knifing disappointment, nudged along by Tan\\'s soft and pleasant narration.With Shirkers, Tan doesn\\'t indulge in nostalgia, but rather evokes an un-calculated, offbeat sensibility that feels distant from our current algorithmic-driven culture.Sandi Tan\\'s view of what the original Shirkers represented, and what her new film should be, proves surprisingly expansive.The genre-defying Shirkers from Sandi Tan might be one of the wildest, most inventive films of this year\\'s Sundance documentary line up.The viewer, more than the filmmaker herself, may lament where Tan\\'s career might have gone. But she seems intent on moving forward - and this project may well be the vehicle for it. [A] cozy nonfiction film.Do you need a life pick-me-up? The dames are here for you.Candid, insightful and unpredictable, Dame Eileen Atkins, Dame Judi Dench, Dame Joan Plowright and Dame Maggie Smith are not only acting legends but also great friends. And a treat to hang out with.A delightful, delicate, delicious crustless-finger-sandwich of a film...Tea With the Dames peters out as a conversation, given there\\'s no real beginning, middle or end to the film. It\\'s a privilege, however, to have been given a tableside seat to listen to this foursome reminisce and ruminate for an hour and a half.We\\'re offered the precious illusion that we\\'re close enough with four pillars of English theatre that they\\'re chatting to us about their memories and feelings; that we get to see them as people and as friends.I guarantee that the appearance of the end credits will leave you wanting much more.While these four actresses are magnificent, their choice of directors is less so; Roger Mitchell (Notting Hill, Hyde Park on the Hudson) makes his biggest contribution by moving the discussion indoors at the sight of rain.Each of these dames of the realm gets to play the choicest of roles: herself.Call it a gabfest. Label it a talkathon. But Tea with the Dames, directed by Roger Michell, is so much more.A conversational feast with four acting Dames-Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins and Joan Plowright-who are not above profane fun and confessions that make them human. Don\\'t miss the chance to bask in the pleasure of their company.The assembled dames are so smart, witty and strong-willed, it\\'s a wrench to have to part company from them at the end of the film.A consistently hilarious 90-minute chat that could have gone on for twice as long (or, ideally, a weekly television series) without ever feeling like too much of a good thing.It plays like the jazzy riff of a seasoned quartet, complete with buoyant solos that may not connect to much else but are still a joy to witness all the same.A takeaway from \"Tea With the Dames\" is that conversation is itself a kind of performance art, and it follows that these women do it better than most.In a perfect world, \"Tea With the Dames\" could be a series. Let us be flies on the wall for this posse\\'s weekly gathering for tea and convivial cackling.For the simple idea of sitting them all at a table and turning on a couple of movie cameras, the director Roger Mitchell should get a royal commendation himself.The movie is akin to sitting down with your friends and having a great chat. I\\'d easily have watched a longer cut of this.Fair warning. It was about ten seconds into this film when the first \"Hello, darling\" dissolved any critical distance I could muster.It is hard to overstate the charm of this restrained and intimate film. An eye-opener on many fronts -- not least when it comes to the kind of gym workouts the octogenarian cancer-survivor undertook to keep herself fit for work as a US Supreme Court judge.A total snooze.Feminism is not a fad, and the Notorious RBG continues to be in the fight for the long haul.Her determination and self-belief are inspiring. She\\'s convinced she still has much to offer. Only a cruel fool would disagree.This solid documentary approaches its subject... with much the same calm eloquence that Bader Ginsburg has brought to her judgments over her career.A documentary that was as sober as its subject might have spent more time on the fascinating archival audio ... but this breezy primer is hard to argue with.The life and work of the associate justice of the US Supreme Court, Ruth Bader Ginsburg (aka \"the notorious RBG\") is the subject of this dense, inspiring and often playful panegyric.RBG isn\\'t a critical portrait of its subject but an enlightening and affectionate one.This is the origin film we really need right now. Directors Cohen and West have brought a liberal trailblazer\\'s fascinating and largely untold story proudly into the spotlight.This lively film tracks Ginsburg\\'s brilliant legal career, fighting for women\\'s workplace rights while shrewdly also taking on cases where men suffered discrimination.The documentary makes us grateful for the truth that \"It takes all sorts to make a world\" - and for the fact that RBG may be staunchest bulwark against the unmaking of that world, in the present American political moment.At the same time, although West and Cohen get around to the version of Ginsburg that has become a meme for Millennials and a symbol of resistance, the greater part of the film celebrates her tireless determination.Ginsburg\\'s contributions to our current legal world are established as profound and revolutionary, although her position on abortion remains pro-choice.And while the documentary transitions to Justice Ginsburg\\'s current status as a pop-culture icon, what\\'s never lost is her vitality for life and the lawRBG is an informative and entertaining documentary portrait.West and Cohen give us a brisk recital of her achievements.I left the theatre informed, inspired, and eager to go to sleep at a normal hour.Ginsburg emerges as a woman of remarkable intelligence and fortitude - who can get by on very little sleep.What emerges is an intriguing portrait of a woman described as shy and retiring but with \"a quiet magnetism,\" a work horse and a master legal strategist.One thing\\'s for sure: She\\'s still standing. May she stay strong. Science Fair may not necessitate a big-screen experience, but there are far lesser ways to spend your study break.A crowd-pleasing, if slightly formulaic, documentary...Our heroes develop complex science projects. They cruise to the finals. Excellence is celebrated. Yet the film, though perfectly competent, never quite matches the sheer inventiveness of its young Einsteins.I loved it.\"Science Fair\" is a celebration of intellect and kids who want to improve the world. Turns out science is pretty cool, after all.The milieu is intense, the stakes are high, and the science prodigies themselves are fascinating.There\\'s a certain amount of tension in the proceedings but, as various participants point out, what counts isn\\'t so much winning as it is having the experience.High marks for skill and clarity of presentation - it\\'s a real crowd pleaser. But if you want to win Best Documentary in Show, you need to push a little harder - take a risk, and hope you\\'ve convinced the audience to pay attention.It\\'s a movie that traffics in a rare commodity: hope for the future.The adorable nerds featured are as charismatic as they are bright, and I assume it was a combination of their personalities and projects that led to their inclusion in the film.You feel you get to know each of the competitors as they make their way through the lead-up, and then through the fair to the awards ceremony.It\\'s impossible not to be charmed by these students, by their aspirations and idealism, not to mention the fact that one of them, or someone like them, may well end up winning a Nobel Prize.These kids have emotional layers and varied interests, and Science Fair does an excellent job demonstrating all aspects of who they are, not just their interest in STEM.Even in a year of extraordinary documentaries like \"RBG,\" \"Won\\'t You Be My Neighbor\" and \"Three Identical Strangers,\" \"Science Fair\" is something special.An irresistible documentary that brims with youthful spirit and high ideals.These kids deserve better. For the future of our planet and our society, we all do.Science Fair melts your heart almost as soon as it begins.Thanks to its lovable subjects, \"Science Fair\" nails the presentation, but its research is only surface deep.An affectionate and supremely entertaining celebration of the all-American nerd ...Meet the future of science. RaMell Ross\\'s remarkable debut feature is as much an experimental film as it is a documentary, and it succeeds smashingly on both fronts.At the same time that Hale County\\'s collage style helps the film avoid becoming a Southern variation on Hoop Dreams, it refuses to lapse into anything resembling hand-wringing melancholy.A visually mesmerizing but only half-illuminating documentary on black lives in the Deep South.Hale County This Morning, This Evening has an impressive pedigree but that wouldn\\'t count for much if it didn\\'t achieve its aim to find a new language for the overlooked parts of neglected lives. But it does -- lovingly.A lyrical meditation on the Black Belt experience, and the parameters of representing it...There are moments of genuine lyricism.At every juncture, Ross elects for ambiguity and poses a question to the viewer to answer how black bodies are viewed, encouraging the audience to perform the labour of challenging their expectations.There is something visionary in this film.Hale County is a kind of mini-epochal calendar art, turning its seasonal pages. With a heavier hand it would have become tendentious or messagey.Through framing and editing, small moments are imbued with a sense of spiritual grace, and the entirely mundane is recalibrated as the sublime.Vividly sketches African-American lives on an Alabama trek that bypasses stereotypes and narrative conceit, proceeding directly to empathy.You could call it a transcendental scrapbook, because it wipes away the muck of subjectivity that guides most movies. It turns the audience into direct receptors of experience.A 76-minute visual poem that pays homage to folks who still harbor hopes and dreams despite a hardscrabble existence.A poetic documentary with a gift for making enrapturing imagery out of what sound like ordinary, everyday events.Though made modestly and intimately, the film embodies a vast conceptual and aesthetic ambition.As a record of African-American imagery, it\\'s not just an evaluation of \\'how we are seen,\\' it\\'s also a corrective that replaces stereotype with visual poetry.Ross remains ever attuned to the casual grace of quotidian human actions, and the subdued splendor of nature at its plainest. Hale County is documentation as a kind of auscultation; the camera functions as a stethoscope, capturing heartbeat and breath.Ross\\'s camera captures the banal, the tragic and the triumphant alike, never lingering on any one moment for too long, and using a dreamy editing technique that doesn\\'t always spell out its associations for us.Mr. Ross retains a patient and focused eye. His camera\\'s gaze has a quality of reserve, one that insistently imparts respect to his subjects.If Ross had embraced anything like a narrative line, would it have taken away from the elemental imagery of his brief, unconventional film? Schible\\'s documentary - while not particularly well shot - is a very useful insight into the work of a major composer.Those who are interested in how documentarians capture artistry on film will find good examples in Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda. It helps to come to the film with some foreknowledge of Sakamoto\\'s career, however.Isn\\'t a life story or a deep-dive character study. Rather it is a heartfelt mediation on the creative process, with elegantly presented ideas on nature, music, mortality and things out of tune.Stephen Nomura Schible\\'s documentary, Ryuichi Sakamoto: CODA is not only a portrait of a great artist, but a sensitive and engrossing depiction of the act of creation and its process.Simply by lingering with his pensive, compelling subject at the keyboard, or engaging Sakamoto (discreetly) in his thoughts on his life and his music, Schible casts a spell and captures the spirit of a uniquely gifted composer.The intimate documentary \"Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda\" finds the accomplished composer in a deeply introspective place in both his life and career.Sakamoto is fascinating to watch. He\\'s a charming, lively presence, and it\\'s always a pleasure to watch his expressions of delight and surprise at the new sounds he\\'s discovering, his own or nature\\'s.Won\\'t hold much appeal for those requiring an introduction, but should please fans with its drifting, lyrical, and thoughtful tenor, echoing so much of this artist\\'s music.Schible started making his film in 2012, and Coda skips deftly across the years, incorporating intimate footage of the composer at work as well as archival footage from his earlier years.By the end of this documentary, you will feel as if you not only understand Mr. Sakamoto intellectually, but also share a sense of the excitement he feels when discovering just the right match of sounds.The documentary...is never busy, never intrusive, and glides along at a delicate pace, occasionally capturing painful footage of Sakamoto forcing down a seemingly endless sequence of anti-cancer pills, but otherwise calm, respectful and thoughtful.Reality and cinema combine seamlessly as editor Hisayo Kushida transitions from studio recordings to film clips that outline an eclectic career.[Sakamoto] is also ceaselessly interested in the possibilities of electronic music, though I have to say shots of him at the piano keyboard are more interesting than him at the computer keyboard.The result is an inspirational and deeply moving biopic that resonates long after the closing credits roll, not only because of the uncertain health of its subject, but the tragedies and joys of the human condition that give meaning to his work.It too often relies on lazy synchronicity, drawing awkward parallels between Sakamoto and the films he\\'s worked on.With a light touch but deep reserves of respect for fans both old and new Ryuichi Sakamoto: Coda is an extremely fitting portrait of the influential composer.By showing the different sides of Sakamoto, Schible enables the viewer to see how they influence this personal album.This is a documentary that rejects every behind-the-scenes clich?? around, and stands as an immensely moving and inspiring piece of cinema in its own right.A gentle, reflective portrait that seldom gets personal and yet somehow feels quite candid. It\\'s a fascinating look -- and it\\'s only 70 minutes long.Directors Quinn Costello, Chris Metzler, and Jeff Springer emphasize their subjects\\' creativity and camaraderie, resulting in a upbeat, flavorful community portrait.The film demonstrates a surprising - and commendable - frankness, especially as its creators interview those working to stay afloat amid hurricanes and nutria-accelerated coastal erosion.Rodents of Unusual Size is also a look at how human folly can contribute to environmental disaster, but awareness and ingenuity can help bail us out.The film\\'s initial non-judgmental perspective eventually sounds more like a public service announcement...A bit icky yet full of charm.A bizarre and fascinating documentary that\\'ll make your jaw drop.Depicting the resilience of both the nutria and the Louisianans who\\'ve endured their presence for many years, Rodents of Unusual Size proves enjoyably quirky and informative. Though it could benefit from more context and history of guide dogs and a little less walk footage, the film offers compelling insight into a process most know little about-and whether they make the cut or not, there\\'s a happy ending for every dog.In a tussle between the appeal of the subject and the plodding banality of the approach, the pups are ultimately the losers.Yes, the structural constraints and the emotional rhythms of reality TV competition shows are all over this, but it\\'s mostly irresistible.The dogs\\' personalities, highlighted by a handy name-tag graphic every time each one gets a segment, bound and yap off the screen.This is exactly the movie we need right now.Viewers of all ages with a fondness for puppies will find it hard to resist.This makes [Pick of the Litter] the perfect family film - especially if you\\'re looking for an antidote to Marvel and DC.The film adopts a fairly bland and unquestioning approach, but the patience of the trainers - and charm of their sometimes unruly canine charges - never ceases to impress.\"Pick of the Litter\" is made with heart and reverence for man\\'s best friend, especially those special pooches who go on to answer a higher calling.By far the most joyous time you\\'ll have at the movies all year.I\\'ve always wondered how guide dogs are trained and, now that I\\'ve seen the documentary Pick of the Litter, I\\'m still not quite sure. As deficient as it is in specifics, it\\'s fairly enjoyable anyway.It\\'s not the kind of story to win Oscars, but it will definitely make you want to pet a pupper.\"Pick\" often feels like a project that has been overly groomed. Will you still be moved to tears? Most likely.A complete delight, a much-needed balm for the soul.While \"Pick of the Litter\" can\\'t be described as innovative, it still creates a solid emotional punch...Pick of the Litter affirms the obvious: the world is a much better place with dogs in it.Pick of the Litter is much more than a puppy parade, educating viewers about what it takes, practically and psychologically, to train a service animal. The wet noses and wagging tails are just a perk.Doggie cuteness and the inherent emotional pull of canine-human companionship wins in the end. Subject matter alone makes Pick of the Litter, if not especially memorable, a gently lovable outing.Bans on talking in movie theaters should be briefly lifted for anyone who can\\'t resist shouting \"Go, Poppet!\" on test days. Which should be almost everyone.It would be a surprise if Pick of the Litter doesn\\'t win over most viewers. There is something almost pagan to the earth magic of Goldsworthy\\'s work; through his eyes we reconnect with an elemental quality in the world around us that, somewhere along the line, we lost the ability to see.This is a hypnotic and beguiling documentary portrait of the 62-year-old site-specific land artist Andy Goldsworthy... Sit back, relax and, in the most literal way possible, watch an artist at work.A friend who watched this with me said that it\\'s the kind of film she\\'d like to see again when she\\'s dying. That pretty much nails its meditative, melancholy tone...It\\'s [Andy] Goldsworthy\\'s version of a snow angel, a simple transitory image that will make you feel oddly happy during its short, earthbound existence.No matter how vivid your home setup might be, it\\'s best to see this in a theatre.There are moments where you may want to stop the film to assure yourself you\\'re seeing what you\\'re seeing, so disordering to the senses are Goldsworthy\\'s re-orderings of nature.\"Leaning Into the Wind\" offers viewers a welcome chance to consider the work of an artist who defies the recent commodification cult to embrace the ephemeral and the nominally \"worthless.\"This is one of the most relaxing experiences I have had watching a movie in a long time.Even if some things have changed, spending time with an artist who\\'s concerned, as he\\'s said in interviews, with \"the permanence of temporary objects and the temporality of permanent objects,\" is always worth the journey.He describes two ways of approaching the world: \"You can walk on the path, or you can walk through the hedge.\"Even at its most self-conflicted, this is a fascinating reminder that some art wasn\\'t made to be owned.Certain images are hokey, but Leaning Into the Wind has a wandering, lonely purity. We feel as if we\\'ve been allowed to fleetingly swim through Goldsworthy\\'s psyche.Such pesky details might ruin the meditative worldview of the film; \"Leaning Into the Wind\" asks us to appreciate art for art\\'s sake, and that\\'s not a tough ask at all.Leaning Into the Wind is a study in seeing, in subordinating one\\'s self to the elements, in creating with nature rather than from it.A nonfiction-focused director and cinematographer frequently attracted to the intersection between artistic expression, nature, and spirituality (however unarticulated), Riedelsheimer is well-matched to Goldsworthy\\'s methods and interests. There\\'s plenty of production detail for Kubrick nuts, though the two competing narratives (Kubrick the genius, Kubrick the tyrant) won\\'t surprise anyone.If there is a cult around Kubrick, Vitali was the first card carrying member.That\\'s where the greatest qualms may come in this stylish and sometimes overly reverential portrait: It\\'s as if Vitali never really existed without the director.\"Filmworker\" is a first-rate account of the ongoing creative process some call dysfunctional. Well, anyone would call it that, actually. But some would also call it worth it.\"Filmworker\\'s\" greatest value lies in pulling the lens back to allow viewers to understand film as a deeply collaborative medium, one in which even the most venerated auteurs cannot accomplish their greatest feats alone.Whether you\\'re fascinated by Kubrick or the human condition this is a minor classic.Next time you watch a Kubruck movie, take note of the high-contrast black and white, or of how consistent the colors have remained over the decades. Thanks, Mr. Vitale!Tony Zierra\\'s fond and slightly unsettling film is, among other things, a reminder of the egolessness necessary for great egos to flourish.The interviewees in Filmworker are lit unflatteringly and not always asked the most pertinent of questions... But some of them offer telling glimpses of how this relationship looked from the outside.[An] edifying, occasionally troubling documentary...Anybody with any interest in Kubrick will be diverted by Filmworker, but it remains an oddly clunky piece of work.Naturally, excuses are made here, mostly by 69-year-old Vitali himself... but it\\'s difficult not see this film as anything other than a gripping portrait of the worst excesses of an industry that continues to support, and nurture, megalomania.But as a portrait of a man who surrendered his career and much of his life to the service of a master, \"Filmworker\" proves compelling, particularly for those with a passing interest in Kubrick.Thanks to the documentary, [Leon Vitali\\'s] contribution is bound now to be acknowledged.It\\'s a fascinating movie, hosted largely by Vitali himself, now older, no doubt wiser, though still visibly excited and perplexed by the enigmatic genius whom he served.By revealing the darker side of Kubrick, we\\'re given an original take on his legacy.Filmworker is an absorbing, important portrait of both a genius at work and the man behind the scenes who made the magic possible, whatever the cost to himself.As [Vitali] recalls these experiences, we get behind-the-scenes glimpses of Kubrick at work on his last films, though how substantive these are depends to an extent on who\\'s interviewed (or not).Watching Filmworker as a cinephile, it\\'s easy to be awed by the Zen-like devotion of Vitali\\'s life\\'s work. But it\\'s also possible to be simultaneously filled with rage at the way people like him are simply left to run endlessly on their hamster wheels.Compelling, despite its modest and uneven means. Director Alexandria Bombach (Frame by Frame) shot this documentary portrait of human rights activist Nadia Murad not long before her subject received the Nobel Peace Prize, and the movie argues persuasively that the prize was well deserved.Be ready for tears, on screen and your own.On Her Shoulders is a compassionate, level-headed portrait of a remarkable woman. What it lacks in filmmaking fireworks, it makes up for in the sheer magnetism and moxie of its hero.Nadia is shown always surrounded by crowds, almost crushed by them. But her utter loneliness is heartbreaking.On Her Shoulders is close to being awful.It would almost be absurd if it weren\\'t so deadly serious.Director Alexandria Bombach doesn\\'t settle for simple biography, instead weaving through the film a deft, sobering commentary about the limitations of political action and the tendency of mass media to unintentionally rob advocates of their voices.\"On Her Shoulders\" is a moving, sensitive portrayal of a woman - and a people\\'s - perseverance.Its subject compels throughout.On Her Shoulders is an intimate, empathetic documentary, made with discretion and power.We see this movie to learn who the young Nobel Peace Prize winner is, but in the end, it is about her challenging us to learn who we are.Alexandria Bombach\\'s direction and editing are exceptional; she captures images that are both subtle and formidable.The film is most interested in homing in on the ways Nadia Murad\\'s fragility and self-doubt arise as collateral damage from her fame and steadfast activism.Director Alexandria Bombach avoids the details of Murad\\'s brutal captivity, showing instead the intense pressure and responsibility the 23-year-old feels as a spokesperson for her people.[Alexandria] Bombach\\'s ability to thoughtfully examine trauma and its narrative in the media and politics creates a new avenue for Nadia\\'s justice outside of the courtroom or parliament.Festivals like Sundance offer many films about activism and politics and human rights, but Alexandria Bombach\\'s documentary On Her Shoulders feels decidedly different.Being in the same room with Nadia says enough in the very powerful On Her Shoulders, even when she is alone with her thoughts.A heartbreaking film.A compelling look at the toll activism takes.People like Nadia can\\'t fix the world, but this vital documentary is proof that it\\'s heroic enough just to be heard. \"Dark Money\" exposes the dangers of unbridled, anonymous political spending so expertly that it will make you fume with anger, practically quake with distress.The film\\'s basic problem is that it jumps around too much... Still, Reed and her team have boiled down their presentation to a manageable 99 minutes that\\'s fascinating, absorbing, and mind-altering.The undue influence of money on elections is not exactly news, but the ways in which that influence can now be secured, given the current state of the law, certainly is.\"Dark Money\" takes a detailed look at an unexpectedly complex situation that is at the heart of political action today.Activist in tone, and paced like a thriller, Reed\\'s movie painstakingly details how an election can be brusquely seized and swayed by unseen forces.Engrossing, lucid, and unsettling...Damning, clear-eyed, and as gripping as any John Grisham thriller.[It] will either bore you to death or boil your blood. As a Washington political junkie, I fall into the latter camp. Your results may vary.It\\'s not an insult to call this an exemplary PBS documentary; let\\'s just say you should make sure you are really in the MOOD for a PBS doc before you check out Dark Money.There\\'s not a dull or dry moment in Reed\\'s briskly paced film about the secret assault on the American electoral and judicial process by corporations whose agenda is nothing less than the dismantling of government itself.A documentary that is by turns engaging, exasperating and confusing.Kimberly Reed\\'s approach is too bloodless to make us feel the full weight of the injustices her film identifies.Reed\\'s sophomore feature is straightforward reportage, telling a complex, multi-issue story with a large number of players, in admirably cogent terms.A densely packed documentary that earnestly and obsessively addresses campaign finance reform, its history and vital importance. As a testament to the wonders of science and space, it\\'s extraordinary; as a testament to the triumph of cinema and mankind, it\\'s more a small step than a giant leap.It\\'s a film that makes history seem freshly minted -- a unique work of restoration made possible by the discovery of a cache of previously unreleased audio recordings and large-format footage.Apollo 11... is quite simply an amazing film.Clocking in at a tidy 90 minutes, laid out in ruthlessly linear fashion, the film plays like one deep breath nervously exhaled. It\\'s also eye-wateringly beautiful to beholdAstonishing...the documentary footage, which alternates from the spaceship and the American audience...it just brought back what an unbelievably impressive achievement it was in 1969.Go. Rush out. Find this film now. Find it on the biggest possible screen, accompanied by the best, loudest sound. And sit back and marvel.A celebration of human endeavour, and of a rare moment of global unity.Sometimes gush is the only appropriate response and the amazingness never gets any less amazing.The director avoids gimmicks or embellishment. Strapping three men to the top of a rocket and blasting them into space is, it turns out, sufficiently gripping on its own.Todd Douglas Miller\\'s 50th-anniversary docu-buster is everything it should be, with the possible exception of exciting.A riveting and awe-inspiring tribute to one of mankind\\'s great achievements.Apollo 11 isn\\'t a film about the facts and stats of the mission to reach the moon. Instead, it\\'s about how it feels to be in space and on the ground as history is made. Stunning, stirring stuff.A masterpiece in storytelling which deserves to be seen on the biggest screen one could possibly find.The Apollo is sprinkled with gems. Williams places his film within the context of Black history in this country while providing anecdotes about the theater itself.Fascinating shots of hundreds of scientists glued to rows of video terminals and switchboards are reduced to mere wallpaper; the work at hand remains a mystery.Apollo 11 is free of extraneous narration, which helps lend it a present-tense feel.It is grand and awe-inspiring, particularly if you can catch it in IMAX... It\\'s almost as if you\\'re actually on the moon.Paradoxically, it\\'s these quieter moments that make Apollo 11 so breathtaking to behold.That perspective - what a group of individuals can do when coming together for a collective good - shapes everything we see.The NASA mission at the heart of the must-see documentary Apollo 11 reminds you what it feels to be truly awestruck. The work as it stands now has considerable merit as a document recorded during a watershed period of the American civil rights movement. As a concert film, it\\'s elevated by Franklin\\'s powerhouse three-octave range and soulful phrasing.The long-buried concert film is a tremendously powerful tribute to Aretha Franklin.This musical feast was filmed a very long time ago - but it feels like only yesterday.In Amazing Grace, Aretha Franklin transcends the blues by saying a little prayer - or singing one - for all of us.It\\'s a perfect marriage of faith and showbiz, dignified by the fact that there\\'s nothing ersatz about it. At its heart is an unfeigned exuberance, together with a sense of history, which informs the tears, laughter and fervent expressions of belief.87 minutes of pure joy/Even though her legacy has been deeply embedded within pop culture, this is a new side of her that the film lets us witness.Franklin - focused, transcendentally beautiful and sweating profusely - takes us back to her roots.When a parishioner leaps to her feet, her spirit clearly moved, you\\'ll want to do the same. Wholy Holy indeed.I felt wrung out at the end of this film. How incredible must it have been for those who were there in person.This is a film that revels in a titanic talent, and the details that an audio recording can never pick up. The close-ups are wonderfully intimate.Amazing Grace is as uplifting a film as you will see all year.If Amazing Grace can\\'t fathom the inner depths of Aretha in any definitive way, it grants her a great deal more than a little respect.Glimpsed away from the mic, she sweeps past the camera with a Mona Lisa smile and no small talk. Between songs she again smiles and says nothing, that silence a story, her choice to be simply a vessel, not a star.Provides the authors of online listicles a permanent starting point when considering the 10 greatest concert films of all time.Surely the new gold standard of filmed music concerts?Sydney Pollack\\'s unfinished documentary, unearthed and reassembled after nearly 50 years, is a priceless gift to music fans.Even for those who do not believe that God\\'s grace is amazing, it is hard not to see Franklin in her prime as something near miraculous, with a long-buried film serving as a witness in 16mm.Amazing Grace is a reminder that spirituality is deeply personal.You don\\'t need to be a churchgoer to find \"Amazing Grace\" a soul-stirring, foot-stomping, hand-raising experience. What a superb way to remember the centenary of the end of the war. Hail Peter.This is as close as we can get to a full immersion into one of the most horrifying and ultimately pointless wars in modern history.There\\'s a lot to debate here, and a lot to admire.\"They Shall Not Grow Old\" is a nearly great talking-head documentary in which the talking heads are never seen, only heard.It\\'s a true act of revival.For the first time, those jittery, frenetic figures in ancient newsreels look and move like people you know.Ultimately, it\\'s a you-are-there time capsule of enormous emotional and historical importance.\"They Shall Not Grow Old\" shows that actually seeing something is different from knowing it intellectually, or even from imagining it. The effect of this is moving and profound.Peter Jackson has taken a mass of World War I archival clips from Britain\\'s Imperial War Museum and fashioned it into a brisk, absorbing and moving experience.In this profound documentary event, Peter Jackson creates digital miracles-in 3D yet-to revitalize archival footage of World War I until faded history comes to vivid, vital life. You won\\'t believe your eyes.For whatever reason, \"They Shall Not Grow Old\" has the effect of a window that has never before been thrown open so wide.Jackson\\'s project seems to me truly phantasmagoric, in Walter Benjamin\\'s terms. A \\'strange meeting\\', to invoke Wilfred Owen\\'s unforgettable image, with archival ghosts in our digital midday.Now, 100 years later, the dead speak to us. And finally, we can understand...to a degree.It\\'s just images and the voices of those who were there, telling their own stories.And the result is riveting - an immersive, haunting and often transcendent experience that\\'s unlike anything you\\'ve ever seen before.As a work of ethical, empathetic exhumation, They Shall Not Grow Old is a model.Jackson\\'s use of editing is extraordinary.A powerful tribute to every veteran and one of the most empathetic portraits of war ever created.The technology Jackson deploys is so advanced that the documentary, which has been colorized and enhanced, captures a surprising degree of character and realism.\"They Shall Not Grow Old\" is a tribute paid by the present to the past, and what a gorgeous gift it turns out to be.They Shall Not Grow Old is a fascinating exposition, told with reverence and stunning colorization, of these men who fought the war they thought would end all wars. This movie about Europe\\'s last wild beekeeper is complex, resonant, and visually magnificent.As fly-on-the-wall documentaries go, Honeyland is a particularly fine example. There is no narration: the rather sad, but enveloping, story is told in purely visual terms, and the photography is outstanding.Hatidze\\'s story is heartbreakingly moving, and needs no heavy editorialising. Her strength, dignity, resilience and humanity carry the film\\'s truth and weight.Terribly sweet. Terribly sad.This is one of the best movies of the year... Over and over again while I was watching it, I was asking myself \"How did they get that shot?\"[A] gripping, Sundance-winning documentary.Brief and to the point, Honeyland proves more meditative than its premise suggests.Although it starts as a meditation on the hardship and rhythms of rural life, Ljubomir Stefanov and Tamara Kotevska\\'s documentary becomes something more intimate.Fancy a northern Macedonian film about beekeeping? \"You will, Oscar, you will,\" I am tempted to say.Stunningly beautiful and quietly powerful, this is a portrait of a vanishing way of life and of a determined woman who\\'s just trying to make her way in the world.Honeyland really is a miraculous feat, shot over three years as if by invisible camera - not a single furtive glance is directed towards the film-makers.A delicate allegory about the impact of modern agriculture.Grave and wise, \"Honeyland\" is ultimately an act of faith, and the filmmakers extend the idea of balance all the way to the film\\'s implicit moral.Both laconic and poignant, Honeyland alternates between stark and austere landscapes with detours into an intimate look at two families who are struggling to literally live their lives.This elegant film... begins as the intimate portrait of a beekeeper who makes famously good honey, and then expands to become something of a parable.As an intervention in the conversation around climate change and natural disaster, Honeyland performs the unique feat of uniting agriculture with human culture, to prove that it is really all just culture.Honeyland is as much about the gooey sticky nectar as it is a story of perseverance.\"Honeyland\" sneaks up on you in a quiet yet powerful way.Its narrative construction depicts extraordinary tensions and conflicts with a clarity and coherence that a screenwriter might dream of. At the same time, the film\\'s dramatic power comes at the expense of the reportorial side of documentary filmmaking.It\\'s the best kind of documentary -- an eye-opener and a mind-opener. They\\'re Democrats, but the movie should be inspiring to anyone who wishes to see firsthand the immeasurable value of good retail politics and hard work.Regardless of one\\'s partisan leanings, it\\'s hard to resist the dramatic momentum of these intertwined narratives.It\\'s a friendly record of an extraordinary moment.Everyone likes an underdog story, and when the underdog is as eloquent, passionate and righteous as these four women are, the final reels of this film feel like a Rocky movie.In the end, Lears finds the hope that she is looking for. It\\'s hard to resist a candidate who is so fresh, so new, so perfectly now.As the primary results pour in, Knock Down the House becomes the electoral equivalent of the Death Star raid in Star Wars.Even though we know the outcome...the campaign progress remains enthralling. Mostly because it\\'s a fascinating snapshot of modern politics in flux...and a hopeful, ultimately moving account of idealism in action.Watch this, and you\\'re watching a revolution, one that will make a lot of viewers stand up and cheer.It\\'s awfully close to hagiography, but it also demonstrates why AOC is such a good campaigner.What animates the whole film is just how much these women are willing to work, sweat, and fight for what they believe in - with a single-minded dedication that has them panicked, exhausted, and outnumbered.Luckily, that show isn\\'t a bad one.A documentary that captures one of the most electric moments in recent history, on radically human terms.Knock Down the House is the rare documentary about today\\'s American political landscape that might make you shed happy tears.I got the impression that they have more practical ideas than we heard, and if so then Lears\\' tearjerker sold them rather short.Knock Down the House prevails with albeit straight-forward intentions: to amplify the women who are both mad as hell and doing something about it.Not unlike the candidates it portrays, Knock Down The House puts in the necessary work towards a payoff that earns both cheers and tears.This galvanizing, all-access Netflix doc concerns the 2018 primary campaigns of four grassroots female Democrats- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Amy Vilela, Cori Bush, and Paula Jean Swearengin-and their fighting spirit blazes through every frame.Perhaps what \"Knock Down the House\" does best, in that context, is highlight the enormous odds that Ocasio-Cortez had to overcome, as well as the dismissive nature of her opponent, the congressional veteran Joe Crowley.After watching Ocasio-Cortez and the other women in Knock Down the House pound the pavement and knock on doors, you can see that they\\'re the ones working hard, and that for them, getting their hands dirty is nothing new.Ocasio-Cortez comes increasingly alive in \"Knock Down the House.\" I have rarely seen a documentary film as powerful as For Sama. The viewer is transported into the Syrian city of Aleppo to experience the very nasty civil war at first hand.[A] dynamic and poignantly personal account of a city\\'s systematic destruction.They display a striking buoyancy, which the film captures in moving detail -- there is laughter, there is comradeship, there is life even in the face of horror.Even when it\\'s drenched in grief, \"For Sama\" contains the seeds of hope.This is devastating. So hard to watch, so heartbreaking, and so inspiring.t might be overstretching it to say the film ends with a message of hope. But it does, at least, speak to the human capacity for survival.You leave understanding why for Al-Kateab the past is something she wants to live with every day.For Sama interweaves its very personal narrative with a broader political story, finding the bigger picture in the tiniest of details.For Sama is one of the most profoundly intimate depictions of the Syrian conflict ever put to film.Mostly, though, this is a film, skilfully pulled together by Edward Watts, the British co-director, that unfolds as a guttural cry of despair and an incendiary plea for justice. See it. But don\\'t take popcorn.For Sama... is acutely personal and intimately authored.Profoundly moving and unignorable, whether as proof of Assad\\'s barbarism, or the unfailing ability of this world - and its most engaged cinema - to break your heart and sear your soul.This harrowing film restores our responsiveness.For Sama powerfully mixes the personal and the political to thought-provoking, emotional ends. The result is one of the best documentaries of 2019.One of the most remarkable and affecting war docs of all time.Must be seen to be believed. Waad Al-Kateab is your new hero.One of the most intimate and stirring documentaries about war in the 21st century, and a plea to the free nations of the world to act.al- Kateab\\'s commitment to bearing witness with her camera was as strong as her husband\\'s to the wounded and dying...\"Places are about their people,\" Hamza insists, and even as For Sama sinks into an uncertain limbo during its final third...this utterly essential documentary never fails to illustrate what he means by that.Watching the film, I felt it would be an act of cowardice to look away from what Waad was showing us. I trusted that this wasn\\'t just propaganda - that I was being asked by a mother to bear witness. [A] heartwarming documentary.Without revealing too much, it\\'s fair to say Maiden, Edwards and her crew did better than most people expected.Maiden is simply riveting, a story of grandeur and sweep that\\'s also moving and intimate because there are so many naked emotions in play.\"Maiden\" makes sense of her journey and tells a story whose tidal waves were felt far beyond the deck of her ship.[Alex] Holmes\\' documentary is as inspirational and empowering as it is frothily exhilarating.A taut, gripping documentary about one young woman\\'s dream...A thrilling, often weepy tale of female empowerment.Using archival footage and fresh recollections, director Alex Holmes offers an illuminating look into the weird world of jibs and rigging in a film that transcends the action of the sport.\"Maiden\" concludes so movingly, with such perfect symbolism, that it rivals any scripted sports drama.Maiden puts us all in the ship right there with them.[Maiden\\'s] a flat-out good yarn.The movie is catnip for the gender parity conversation that ends on a triumphant note.If only director Alex Holmes\\' ability to commandeer a story was one-tenth as ambitious as his lead character.Writer-director Alex Holmes (\"Stop at Nothing: The Lance Armstrong Story\") absorbingly recounts the story of Edwards and her team in an unfussy linear style that effectively recaptures the tension of their gutsy undertaking.Maiden\" celebrates the defiant spirit of all the female athletes who have challenged the sporting world\\'s entrenched sexism.With stunning archival footage and interviews with the amazing Maiden crew, Holmes captures that high in this stirring documentary that recounts not just the feminist achievement, but triumph of the human spirit.But even at its most visceral and exciting, it\\'s the emotion at the story\\'s core, and the higher principles at work, that make it transcendent.An all-women crew knocked the sexist world on its ass by winning this 1989 yacht race. This dazzling doc from director Alex Holmes proves these female pioneers are still a cause for celebration.What we have from director Alex Holmes is a documentary with all the nervous-making energy of a first-rate drama; a cast of sailors who are both endearing and intelligent; and a delicately wrought suspense story.Maiden excels as a suspenseful sports tale and a record of a historic first, but its biggest strength is in its warts-and-all character study of the Maiden crew. Grand atrocities pile atop private heartbreak as this powerful film unfolds.What eventually emerges is a peerless portrait of collective trauma - a devastating look at how this law not only sociologically gutted a country but made everyone complicit in the crime.[A] powerful documentary...The filmmakers\\' politics aside, \\'One Child Nation\\' is overwhelmingly, and on multiple levels, a pro-life film.[A] houghtful and sobering dissection of the human toll of government rule.The one-child era is still recent enough to exist in living memory, but that won\\'t always be the case; given authoritarian governments\\' habit of rewriting history to their liking, One Child Nation feels like an essential document.One Child Nation does not flinch from critiquing mass complicity and the broader cultural logic - specifically the indoctrination into party politics - undergirding it.Wang hopes her film will serve to bear witness to the suffering of this shameful period, now being purged from the collective memory with \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\"-like efficiency.As a rule, talking heads do not make for compelling film. But such heads, and such talk.[Nanfu] Wang began this film as a way to rediscover her own past. It does far more than that. It will help ensure that the full tragedy of those years is not forgotten. Anyone who sees this film is not likely to forget.In a very full and riveting 85 minutes, \"One Child Nation\" assembles a huge story together from many small, crucial pieces.This is an important film, if often a difficult one to watch.This sort of film calls for bracing yourself and keeping your eyes open. Funny how many of those there are these days.It\\'s stunning, it\\'s sickening, it\\'s heartbreaking.Its directness and intimacy lend an indelibility that encyclopedic framing could never approximate. The one-child policy haunts Wang, and she wants it to haunt the viewer, too.What we learn is fascinating and troubling, albeit within a narrow range.Shocking as it may be, One Child Nation needs to be seen.More horrifying than any screamer you\\'ll see this year.Soul-baring and furious, the documentary \"One Child Nation\" takes a powerful, unflinching look at China\\'s present through its past.The individual stories that make up \"One Child Nation,\" illuminate an entire history of institutional corruption, medical brutality and pervasive misogyny. White Riot is a wild ride, a timely but never preachy reminder that Black lives mattering is not a new fight for those in the music industry.The film is a reminder as to how deeply entrenched are the roots of fascism, and not only in Britain.The film is highly entertaining, suitably chaotic and unpredictable, but with a clear purpose -- to show that RAR made a difference.It\\'s a tribute to the fire and ferment of Rock Against Racism, and to Shah\\'s infectious passion for her subject, that White Riot feels at least half an hour too short.\\'White Riot\\' uses archive footage and stills brilliantly. It dispenses with expositional voiceover and clocks in at a lean 80 mins. But all of that pales beside its central message.Here\\'s a blueprint for resistance.In an America saddled with an anti-immigrant president who refuses to denounce white supremacist organizations like the Proud Boys, White Riot is a timely history lesson.The group got things done, and the movie is especially compelling in its depiction of political organization in the analog age.Rare, raw gig footage, featuring the likes of The Clash and Tom Robinson, is guaranteed to get you pogo-ing in your seat.A film that is as much about the power of solidarity as the dangers of intolerance. Leave the last words to Sham 69: if the kids are united they will never be divided.Shah presents a highly relevant reminder of what can be achieved when people unite against the forces of division.An excellent brief documentary about a heroic grassroots political movement whose importance reveals itself more clearly in retrospect with every year that passes.To her credit, the director Rubika Shah resists the temptation to editorialize. She lets the pictures, and the participants, tell the story.Wisely, Shah keep things punky and to-the-point.It\\'s a cliche?√º to describe a film as \"essential viewing\", but this really is....brilliantly uplifting...a movement that says \"no!,\" it appealed to me...Rubika Shah\\'s smart, spirited feature debut is a whistle-stop tour of a DIY uprising.An engaging historical story with timely contemporary echoes. A film that finds poignant family moments even in the darkest depths of the ongoing refugee crisis.The combination of perspectives paints a vivid and hopeful portrait of a family, as well as an indictment of the refugee crisis.Shot entirely on iPhones, the Afghan director\\'s charming and moving documentary charts his three-year flight with his young family from Tajikistan, where they had failed to find asylum, 3,500 miles to the west.It is a suspenseful adventure story, a psychological profile of a family on the run and, most poignantly, an intimate portrait of two young children adopting adult behaviours as a matter of survival.A film that should be required viewing for anyone seeking to enter the debate on the refugee crisis, not as polemic but as a digital box of surprises.A powerful, personal piece of work.Midnight Traveler is an unforgettable answer to the refugee question.In showing such a personal, unmeditated view of the global migration crisis through one family\\'s story, \"Midnight Traveler\" is a timely, essential film.What makes Midnight Traveler distinct from its counterparts is that it follows filmmaker Hassan Fazili\\'s own family, and the intimacy he\\'s able to capture over the life spans of three iPhones makes his documentary more tender and honest and immediate.It is the gift of \"Midnight Traveler\" to allow us to feel this family\\'s fate in the pit of our stomachs. If the plight of refugees has ever seemed abstract, this film makes sure you know how real it is.A remarkable documentary...Discussing their circumstances incisively, they offer trenchant views of religious and popular culture-and the role and the power of the cinema itself.It achieves its mission of putting an intimate, human face on a seemingly overwhelming, faraway subject.Hassan Fazili\\'s documentary, Midnight Traveler, offers a necessary corrective to the widely held contention that refugees have nothing to offer to the countries where they land.A bracingly intimate look at the trials of modern displacement...It\\'s doing everything that it can.What largely distinguishes \"Midnight Traveler\" is its anxious intimacy, a sense of uneasy closeness that pulls you into a family circle that at times gets very small, creating a sense of appropriate claustrophobia.Balancing rough-edge verit?? with highly composed images and a meticulous structure, it doesn\\'t preclude itself from finding something like poetry in its subjects\\' struggles.A documentary that feels like a modern-day message in a bottle, an urgent appeal for help from a family that\\'s still searching for a home.It\\'s a remarkable achievement.A valuable, first-hand refugees\\' story. \"Varda by Agn?¬øs\" provides an essential look inside the creative mind. It\\'s not often that filmmakers reveal themselves so openly while looking back over their careers, and it\\'s a treat when they do.It\\'s a self-portrait, a film history lesson, a remembrance of things past, a perfect coda to her career, a moving scrapbook and a masterclass that now doubles as a memento mori.This is a wonderful movie -- one of my favorites of the year... Even if you haven\\'t seen any of her movies, it\\'s like meeting an old friend.\"Varda by Agn?¬øs\" may be a summing up from one end of a long, beautiful life in art. But it has the lightness, curiosity and spirit of a first film, and that tells us who Varda the artist was too: ever inspired, ever creating, ever eager to share.This final film acts as a perfect button to a legendary life in art, and it\\'s also a launchpad to viewers who want to go back and explore her groundbreaking contributions to the cinema.One of the treats of \"Varda by Agn?¬øs\" is seeing the director in photos and on-set footage over the years, forever self-possessed, always questing.The late documentarian\\'s final work is a literal master class: a filmed lecture during which she rambles enjoyably through her greatest hits.Another testament to the totality of [Varda\\'s] vision.\"Varda by Agn?¬øs,\" is a fantastic, multi-layered self-portrait that doubles as a tribute to her life and work.It\\'s a perfect introduction and a lovely valediction.Varda By Agn?¬øs is most valuable as a freestanding lesson in filmmaking.The result is a grand, warmhearted testament to her lifetime of creative connections, her art of self-transformation, and her relentless transformation of the art of cinema itself.Varda throughout her life and art accompanied time like an old friend, and we admire her career as if she were ours too during the enriching Varda by Agn?¬øs .A master class on filmmaking by the late, great Agn?¬øs Varda, by way of a tour of her 64 years behind and in front of the lens, as a leading force of the French New Wave.This is a fascinating, informative, and reflective swan song that gives Varda the final word, and some of the due she\\'s been owed her entire career, as one of the most influential feminist filmmakers.A parting gift from one of the greatest directors who ever lived.It gets a little less sexy towards the end as she ruminates on her love affair with still photography and the essence of truth in the captured image, but overall this is an essential and heart-warming portrait of a sorely missed talent.Varda\\'s tone remains generously intimate, friendly and unpretentious.A gorgeous trip down memory lane and an impeccably presented primer - one that very much smacks of the official version.Funny, moving and insightful, all filmmakers should lay out their art and art like this. But not all filmmakers can be Agn?¬øs Varda. The movie provides valuable food for thought about the role of religion in American society.This engrossing documentary illuminates numerous facets of an outre circus with a serious purpose.A very witty, smart, eye-opening and entertaining documentary.Satan hasn\\'t looked this appealing since John Milton\\'s romantic write-up in Paradise Lost.Though she takes her subjects seriously, Lane allows herself to be led by her sense of humour.Way to go! Is membership of this group still open?[A] funny, light-hearted documentary...A devilishly funny documentary that blends improbable imagery, self-awareness and religious provocation with a genuine sense of political purpose.The conclusion to be drawn from [Penny] Lane\\'s film is that these eccentrics may themselves be in danger... but they aren\\'t much of a danger to the rest of us.In Hail Satan? Lane in many ways mirrors the shrewd sense of radical playfulness that underscores The Temple of Satan\\'s own ideological and moral agenda, while at the same time never downplaying the importance and scale of their visionDirector Penny Lane frames her smart, level-headed documentary as a discussion about the Satanic Temple and its fight for religious equality.The question mark in the title of Penny Lane\\'s documentary on The Satanic Temple is integral to the story she\\'s telling...a fine, thought-provoking effort.These outspoken occultists consider themselves not so much part of a religion as a politically active agency espousing individualism, self-expression and liberty.In keeping with the Temple\\'s highly endearing sense of humour, Lane\\'s doc approaches their activities with an irreverence that never feels mocking.It\\'s a sly primer in homegrown grassroots activism.What Hail Satan? really achieves is to show this new brand of Satanism as part of the same tradition as the Dadaists and the Church of the SubGenius, fighting for actual liberty and debunking falsehoods.As a study in the art of media manipulation and civic trolling, \"Hail Satan?\" is informative and entertaining.Consistent with her oeuvre, what she finds is surprising and much deeper and more important than the surface of goth makeup, unsettling rituals and weird symbolism initially suggests.It\\'s impressive how rarely you feel as if you\\'re watching different movies.\"Hail Satan?\" is too lacking in conflict (apart from the eternal one) to be a true study of a movement. But it\\'s a highly entertaining survey. Fascinating film... Very, very interesting stuff.Perhaps the slickly made documentary overstates the cultural impact of a little-seen and widely disliked film. However, it earns points for scraping at the surface of something rarely discussed in film fandom - homosexuality in horror.There are interviews with academics and drag queens and fans of the horror genre, and this gives the movie a wide-ranging perspective that helps us better understand the moving personal story at its core.Scream, Queen! feels a bit self-indulgent at times, exploring so many tangents that it tends to lose focus. Nonetheless, it\\'s a fascinating sociological examination of the circumstances surrounding a film that inadvertently became a camp classic.Scream, Queen! reaches into the fabulous recesses of queer horror fans, filmmakers, and academics to offer a well-rounded and humorous accounting of the queer cult classic.There\\'s a radiant humanity to this horror-doc that takes it from fascinating fun to truly stupendous. The program is a must-see for any student of literature and anyone curious about her work, and the world from which she emerged.Whether you have read everything she wrote or have never ventured into her worlds, it\\'s likely that the first thing you\\'ll do when you leave the cinema is pick up one of her novels.Greenfield-Sanders\\'s film is not as structurally daring as its subject, but it makes great use of archive and text alongside its talking heads.This documentary is a potent commercial for the books themselves.Makes you want to read the books, so full success on that front.For all the intellectual content, the most rewarding part of this documentary is the presence of Morrison herself - her infectious laugh, her famous carrot cake, her joyful love of parties.Coming less than a year after her death, Timothy Greenfield-Sanders\\' film can\\'t help being an elegy - but a celebration, too, of a woman acutely of her times and always a step ahead of them.A celebratory portrait of author Toni Morrison painted by those who knew her, this compelling documentary also explores how her work gives such a powerful voice to the African American experience.She\\'s very guarded, but a friend, director Timothy Greenfield-Sanders, got her to open up in a fascinating way.[Toni] Morrison remains an inspiration for many reasons, but especially because she believed in her own talents long before the institutional arbiters of such things caught on to them.The tone is generally celebratory and, given Morrison\\'s extraordinary impact on American letters, deservedly so.[W]hen it\\'s over, you feel like a beloved friend has left the room.[I]n \"Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am,\" Timothy Greenfield-Sanders\\' outstanding documentary, [Morrison] tells stories, right to the camera, about herself and her life and her work, and it\\'s magical.Though the documentary is conventionally structured, it still stands tall as a valuable record of the life and times and work of an American treasure.Vigorous and forever fierce, and sporting a range of talents so impressive as to be virtually incomprehensible to us lesser creatives and activists who nonetheless seek our own artistic destinies, Toni Morrison: The Pieces I Am is required viewing.If the film is both linear... and plainly adoring, it also gives you ample reason for that adoration. You certainly end up admiring Toni Morrison, but also aching to know a bit more about her.As with Morrison\\'s books, The Pieces I Am invites multiple, maybe even piecemeal, encores, because few writers wield the capacity to leave their readers with an evolving parting message with each subsequent reread.It\\'s like attending office hours for the professor you love and fear.While the format as such doesn\\'t allow for a critical push-and-pull, that\\'s not a debit. This is about time well spent on a life well lived. A series of pieces adding up to much more than the whole.It doesn\\'t matter whether you\\'ve have read all - or any - of Morrison books. Either way, you may leave the theater wanting to pick one up on the way home. Watching 63 Up as a stand-alone endeavor may not seem remarkable. In fact, it may even be a little boring. But watching it as part of the larger picture imbues it with immediacy and power.There is a touching universality to these life stories, which at this point have a lulling near-sameness...At first glance, 21 Up played as somewhat of a novelty. That was over forty years ago. Today, it stands as one of cinema\\'s greatest achievements, a use of the medium that\\'s at once blatantly logical and profoundly affecting.This film and its predecessors are a mirror to all.Kim Horton skillfully weaves together clips from past films - the participants\\' lives inside a fishbowl literally flashing before our eyes - and both Apted\\'s narration and his gently needling, off-camera interrogations give you all the context you need.Because of this sense of an approaching end-in a world which, in any case, is tending to see the future in apocalyptic terms-63 Up may be the most revealing episode yet.The participants in Michael Apted\\'s ongoing social experiment, which began with \"Seven Up!\" in 1964 and has become increasingly fascinating, have reached the age where they can see the approaching exit sign in their lives.Cherish 63 Up, like you cherish life.[T]he real brilliance of \"63 Up\" and its predecessors isn\\'t the light these movies shine on Tony, Jackie, John, Neil and the rest, but the mirror they hold up in front of us.The tone has become melancholy and wise.Heartwarming... It\\'s quite poignant.It\\'s very touching... There\\'s a lot to love in this movie.A melancholy reminder that nothing lasts forever.What\\'s striking is not just the sturdy durability of family and community, but the fundamental decency of just about every participant in this long cultural experiment.A perfectly satisfying summing-up of what\\'s proven to be the surest motive for any of its participants to keep filling us in on their personal lives - they did it because time, love, and just enough fortune allowed it.There\\'s great pleasure in revisiting this series, seeing who turned out just fine and sometimes better than you might have expected or hoped.Now back to look at its diverse group of Brits at age 63, the project is settling into a grandfatherly comfort.Throughout, the remaining participants take stock of private and career successes as well as perceived failures.So beautiful and bittersweet.If this is the final chapter, as Apted suggests it could be, it\\'s a worthy cap to one of the boldest experiments in world cinema. Mexico City has fewer than 45 official ambulances serving nine million people... Luke Lorentzen\\'s adrenalised documentary focuses on one of the private teams that fill the gap.Packed with tense moments and disturbing shots that, without compromising the clients\\' privacy, hint at the unhappiness just offscreen.[A] superb observational documentary...Fast paced, action packed. An intimate portrait of the human costs of Mexico\\'s healthcare crisis.Much of the film plays like a madly adrenal action movie.Were it not for the real tragedy and horror involved, this documentary could almost be filed under the bleakest and often hilarious kind of black comedy.At 81 minutes, you won\\'t be bored, but don\\'t be surprised if the car ride home finds you questioning how an audition reel for a reality television program earned a theatrical release.There\\'s something vaguely outlandish about the way they speed through the streets... Yet there\\'s also a strong moral core, like Juan yelling at a junkie whose glue-sniffing antics leave his kid in a coma.\"Midnight Family\" is both a compassionate portrait of a working-class family and a frightening ride through a broken healthcare system that risks the lives of both patients and providers like the Ochoa family.What\\'s indelible in this visceral chronicle is that more than profiting from human suffering, the Ochoas fill the gaps of economic inequality while doing good without reservation.One of the great contemporary films about the look and feel of a big city after dark.Periodically while watching \"Midnight Family\" you feel as if you can\\'t look at the screen for another second. But you can\\'t look away either.These moments of downtime provide a warm, comic energy to Midnight Family that renders the Ochoas naturally sympathetic subjects and illustrates why Lorentzen decided to film them in the first place.It\\'s the mix of the humane and the calculating that gives the film its empathetic power.A sweet, fascinating portrait of a group of people trying to make the best of a bad situation, and sometimes succeeding.An intriguing perspective on health care in urban Mexico.Profound and thrilling cinema verit?? filmmaking.Portraits of institutional dysfunction don\\'t come much more urgent, and quietly bleak, than this... While never preachy, the director Max Lewkowicz nonetheless makes the case that Fiddler remains a vital and urgent piece of art about refugees, intolerance and the perennial clash of modernity with, yep, sing it with me, tradition!The clip of the Temptations singing a cover of If I Were a Rich Man is worth the price of admission alone.This film will be a treasure trove of insight into not just the making of a musical, but of women and men who had the courage of their convictions in the face of odds set against them.It reminds us of why \"Fiddler\" is so enduring simply through the characters, story, and music that will still be touching audiences in another 50 years.What makes it brilliant is that it demonstrates how universal this distinctly Jewish musical has become, how it has been embraced by many cultures and how it is still influential today.It made me totally want to go see [Fiddler on the Roof] again... A really enlightening documentary.There\\'s considerable pleasure to be had here, particularly in the interweaving of several decades\\' performance clips in various staging styles and languages.[T]his engaging and enlightening documentary is stuffed with anecdotes, history and information. It makes excellent use of both new interviews and carefully selected archival footage to reveal the building blocks of all this accomplishment.The heart of \"Fiddler\" is family, and the film really touches on the meaning of family -- where not everything is pretty, and not everyone gets along, yet there\\'s a connective tissue that offers a warm embrace to the audience.Max Lewkowicz\\'s documentary keeps reminding us of the multiple sources of inspiration for this quintessentially Jewish musical, from the paintings of Marc Chagall to the politics of the day.Max Lewkowicz\\'s documentary emerges as essential viewing by exposing the behind-the-scenes drama and on-stage magic of \\'Fiddler on the Roof,\\' a musical and cultural landmark whose influence spans nations, races, religions and generations.Toes will tap, a tear or two might be shed - a complex story about a deceivingly complex musical is adoringly told and ultimately simplified.For those who might regard \"Fiddler on the Roof\" merely as just another warhorse musical and a favorite of dinner theater and high school drama societies, Max Lewkowicz\\'s rowdy and informative \"Fiddler: A Miracle of Miracles\" might change their minds.An exhaustive, emotional testament to the musical\\'s staying power as popular entertainment and its extraordinary thematic reach. This documentary speaks to everyone - those on the factory floor and the CEO ... It shows both sides and lets you make up your own mind.Could not have been more timely.American Factory sets out to chart what\\'s supposed to be a test run for the future of the auto industry and an example of positive international relations. It ends up capturing a cross-cultural car wreck in slow motion.Reichert and Bognar are clearly on the side of the workers, both American and Chinese, yet their film is no Michael Moore polemic. It\\'s an old-school observational documentary in the very best sense of the term.A mesmerizing jumble of culture and labor politics.The movie is eye-opening - a windshield on the new world.Sharply delineates the possibilities - and the limits - of a modern global economy.Given the global context of the story, The title \"American Factory\" carries with it more than a hint of irony. But the documentary tells an increasingly American story.It is, in essence, a scholarly, almost sociological treatment of the material, in a way that broadly speaks to the plight of these blue-collar workers, with an empathy that\\'s personal but not partisan.\"American Factory,\" an exquisite documentary set at the contradictory core where those forces converge, tells a macroeconomic story through the micro-level experiences of indelible real-life characters.A snapshot of the struggle between labor and management that is both timeless and distinctly of its time.Resembles a Frank Capra movie that cuts off right before the third act, just when everything looks grim and the future is uncertain.The real world is not a just or simple place, this thorough, compelling documentary points out, no matter how deeply we may wish it were.Complex, stirring, timely and beautifully shaped...It\\'s really terrific and really relevant.American Factory tackles the challenges of globalization with much more depth and nuance than most reporting on the topic, precisely because it steps back to watch a story unfold over time and resists easy generalizations.Everyone-regardless of their background or values-is working hard. By telling their stories, entertainingly and persuasively, Bognar and Reichert make the case that they all deserve better.The filmmakers\\' probing analysis reveals the basic principles of freedom and dignity within the political essence of labor issues.In the end it becomes clear that one side will conquer in a battle between two extremes, and merely putting up a sign saying \"Marching Forward to be World Leading Automotive Glass Provider\" won\\'t fix rumbles of dissent.Absorbing, discomfiting and desperately sad. Celebrating the magic of cinema as much as it explains it, Making Waves will have cinephiles listening to their favourite movies with fresh ears.You wouldn\\'t seize on film sound as the sexiest of subjects, yet Midge Costin\\'s documentary is a doozy, as inspiring as it is informative.The blend of historical overview, film clips, tech info, and inside business on offer is pretty irresistible.Just see this film. And then wonder if \"see\" is any longer an adequate verb for the act of experiencing great cinema.Midge Costin\\'s marvellous documentary opens our eyes to a subtle art typically dismissed as the boring \\'loo break\\' category of movie awards ceremonies.If it feels like a feelgood in-house promotional video for Hollywood technicians ... well, they\\'ve got an awful lot to feel good about.\"Making Waves\" is about the evolution of film technology, yet the key to its appeal is that it revels in the holistic, aesthetic side of technology: not just buttons and dials and gizmos, but technology as an expression of something human.A practically perfect primer for anyone interested in the history and craft of filmmaking, answering most of the pertinent, baseline questions while leaving plenty of room for supplemental research.Those who make the effort to see this fascinating film will feel their time has been equally well spent.A cogent and winning picture...Making Waves will likely inspire viewers to seek out their favorite films and experience them with fresh ears.Fascinating and informative, it\\'s a \\'must-watch\\' for film students and fans alike.The clips are cute, but \"Making Waves\" leaves you eager to go hear a favorite movie for the first time. The grace of someone like Dr. Ballour and her colleagues is unquestioned, endlessly valuable and deserving of all the recognition in the world. What it is not is banal. Which is what \"The Cave\" comes dangerously close to making it.It\\'s still profoundly effective film-making, but feels less true.Like Ballour, it has a purpose: to focus the world\\'s attention on the suffering of Syrian people.Manipulations in post-production slightly undermine material that is already dramatic enough.A blistering documentary about death defiance in a war zone.Acute sociological tension mingles with the physical and psychological terror of bombings and of the chemical attack.A profile in courage under fire, The Cave sometimes relieves its enervating tension with occasional MASH-like interludes of levity: a surprise birthday party, some bickering over rice recipes, thoughtful drags on cigarettes.The Cave like the region, shouldn\\'t be ignored.It\\'s no surprise the film won the People\\'s Choice Documentary Award at this year\\'s Toronto International Film Festival.\"The Cave\" is a stark reminder of the toll of war, but also of the tenacity of the human spirit. God may not be watching, but we all should.Fayyad is a humanitarian, and his approach in \"The Cave\" demonstrates that.The primary focus, drawn from hundreds of hours of footage shot between 2016 and 2018, is on the physician Amani Ballour. I\\'ve rarely seen a more inspiring figure in a movie.This extraordinary film allows viewers to bear witness to courage and dedication in their finest forms - and it offers a grim reminder that justice, mercy and healing have been driven underground for centuries.This film is just stunning. It\\'s a miracle it got made and it\\'s a miracle that it got out into the world.A beautifully shot documentary that\\'s as stunning as the images are harrowing.With Syria once again in the news for all the worst reasons, \"The Cave\" reminds us of the horrors of a situation we have perhaps become numb to and shows us the unforgettable people who don\\'t have that luxury.Mixes the intensity of emergency work with the occasional quiet of exhausted heroes fighting back dejection.Feels both familiar and bleakly necessary.\"The Cave\" is a frightening immersion in life under siege in Syria that, as difficult as it often is to watch, can\\'t come close to replicating how harrowing it must have been to film.The Cave isn\\'t the best tribute to their actions. Instead, it\\'s a monotonous descent into agony that coasts on the impossibility of anyone walking away unaffected by the imagery. It\\'s grimly compelling viewing as Marcos gives filmmaker Lauren Greenfield intimate access to her opulent life and oblivious narcissism.The Kingmaker is a thoroughly entertaining primer on the past, present, and perhaps future of Filipino politicsWhat\\'s interesting about the film is that at the center is this ludicrous, ridiculous figure. As the doc scratches away at this, you see grotesque horror, and I thought that was a very astute way of approaching this.From her very first simper, I was hooked. Some see Imelda as one of the world\\'s greatest villains. After this tour of her closet, that shoe fits.Greenfield\\'s portrait is damning.It\\'s dark material, expertly handled.While the film starts in wry fly-on-the-wall mode, it morphs into something weightier and surreally unsettling - Louis Theroux to Luis Bu??uel in 60 minutes flat.For all that Marcos has to be one of the most purely objectionable figures in public life anywhere in the world, she is not a fool and occasionally reveals shrewd insights about herself.\"The Kingmaker\" chills the soul by presenting shantytown residents and school kids who extol the Marcos regime and even endorse its eight-year period of martial law.As horror stories go, it\\'s sometimes funny. As comedies go, it\\'s pretty horrifying.While the film never manages an Act Of Killing-type confrontation, [Lauren] Greenfield injects a canny contemporary Trumpian relevance to her timely, engrossing portrait of dynastic power-grabbing.The first half is a conventional biography but as it progresses, \\'The Kingmaker\\' takes shape as an acute study of the psychology of power.The Kingmaker is a terrifying film.It\\'s a documentary that starts as a nonfiction portrait and ends as a political horror movie.A very, very sharp film.You think it\\'s going to be a kitsch piece for about 10 minutes... And then the film starts to take a very modern, political, and terrifying turn.One of the most insightful portraits of what is basically sociopathic behavior excused by wealth and privilege that a documentary has ever produced.\"The Kingmaker\" may end on a queasy note of alarm about the Philippines\\' future, but it also reminds us that we neglect the past at our peril.All of this makes The Kingmaker Greenfield\\'s most urgent film by far, which only makes its lack of focus that much more frustrating.It\\'s an ugly story shrewdly told, with a sense of humor and also a deeper feeling for history. Though clearly an adoring tribute, Love, Antosha allows its subject a sort of complicated humanity that expands our understanding of him.It serves as both a celebration of Yelchin\\'s life and a tribute to his parents, particularly his mother. That infuses the film with a warmth and compassion that keeps it from feeling like a funeral-service memorial.Mostly, the Antosha of \"Love, Antosha\" seems like a good kid: someone whose life -- and tragic death -- should inspire us to spend our brief time here as wisely and as well as he did.It\\'s very powerful and also very sad.The title is how the immigrant\\'s child closed his frequent and heartfelt letters to his fiercely devoted mother Irina, and the film plays a bit like her loving reply: a tribute to the son whose grave she still visits daily.Unfortunately, Love, Antosha, while providing the requisite information, never rises above a sapling.Price has given us Yelchin\\'s most complete performance: himself. It is a cinematic gift to contemporary film fans everywhere.[An] affectionate, heartbreaking documentary...\"Love, Antosha\" manages to be both a deeply sad farewell and a fascinating introduction.Yelchin was fighting to fill every waking moment with art, making it and absorbing it, and his many journal entries (narrated by Nicolas Cage, giving one of his best performances in many years) reveal great insight and emotional depth.With Love Antosha, there\\'s now a coda to Yelchin\\'s story beyond somber headlines and obits.It\\'s a film made with as much love for its subject as the subject harbored for his friends and family.\"Love, Antosha\" gives Yelchin\\'s co-workers and the people who knew him best a chance to describe what made him so extraordinary.Love, Antosha isn\\'t a sad film...but instead is meant to inspire, uplift, and ultimately prove that Yelchin was better than anybody could have dreamed of.Understandably a document of what was lost, but it also serves as a reminder of the impact one can have even in such a comparatively small window of time.A touching and surprising portrait of an actor who had much more going on in his life - from a serious illness to some seriously left-field artistic inclinations - than was mentioned in his obituaries.A rich reminiscence of a gifted actor who died far too young. Worth seeing if you\\'re interested in journalists, watching people give an interview...there are some really juicy and interesting clips regarding freedom of the press...This film does not offer any actual conclusions, but it is an atmospheric immersion in the old, smoky and very male world of American TV journalism.A little more air might have been welcome, but this remains a hugely entertaining film for anyone interested in the American way of communicating.Terrific and informative.A solid piece of cultural investigation built around a man who helped write history while it happened.Belkin floats the notion that Wallace\\'s sharp-tongued style paved the way for the lying loudmouths who now populate our fractured media landscape, but it feels like a half-hearted bid for contemporary relevance. At least his prickishness had purpose.The film deftly weaves news and interview clips from Wallace\\'s half-century on TV with the times he himself answered questions as tough as those he asked, fleshing out one of the country\\'s last formidable journalists.This is a time capsule - an expertly crafted time capsule - of an astonishing career.Belkin\\'s portrait evokes the spirit of a typical Wallace interview: hard-hitting and unflinching in pursuit of the truth.Watching Belkin\\'s documentary, one realizes how much better Wallace was at playing Mike Wallace than any actor could be.Mike Wallace Is Here [is] an inversion of the normal documentary hagiographic format. Instead, it\\'s an unflinching examination of a legacy of negatives and positives that extend far beyond the newsroom.In the end, \"Mike Wallace Is Here\" isn\\'t just about one journalist, but a different cultural landscape, before a mass of cable network screamers and talking heads, checkbook journalism, social media and viral videos.[A] watchable if by the book retrospective of the career of the newsman most famous for his hard-hitting interviews and expos??s on the CBS newsmagazine \"60 Minutes.\"What results is a portrait of Wallace in effect in dialogue with himself, a presentation that puts viewers on edge a bit the way the man himself interacted with the world.Despite its shortcomings, Mike Wallace is Here is well worth watching, primarily for Wallace\\'s interviews with a who\\'s who of celebrities and world leaders -- augmented by outtakes, raw material and previously unseen archival footage.Mike Wallace Is Here doesn\\'t answer tough questions about Wallace\\'s career: Was it drama, good journalism or both? What was his legacy? But Avi Belkin\\'s documentary offers fascinating insights into what made its subject tick.Having watched Wallace since childhood I was riveted to the screen from start to finish. As a character portrait and reflection on an era, Mike Wallace is Here is as vibrant and timely as its subjectBy keeping all the footage in a past in which Wallace was still working, it confronts both his legacy and, I suppose, his ghost.Even Mike Wallace Is Here doesn\\'t fully separate entertainment and news; this is often an insightful film, but it\\'s full of delights for journalism, history, and political junkies alikeBelkin uses entirely existing footage to tell a story not just of a man\\'s life but also the evolution of broadcast journalism. It\\'s both a novel choice and a largely effective one. It\\'s the awkward editing, superfluous celebrity interviews, and an emphasis on the search for inconsequential facts that obscure what should be its focus - Guy-Blach??\\'s formidable talent.Cineastes, film nerds and feminists alike will be gripped by this documentary portrait of Alice Guy-Blach??. Who? That\\'s the point.A playful but ardent documentary tribute to Guy Blach??, a film-maker fully deserving the overworked title of pioneer.[A] hectic, garrulous, fascinating documentary...The ingrained sexism it highlights could form the basis of several sequels.It definitely piques your interest about her work.What I like about it especially is that it captures this fleeting moment of almost innocence near the time of the dawn of cinema when directing was not automatically assumed to be a man\\'s job and where women directing a film was no big deal.The all-important films are shown in almost subliminal excerpts, offering today\\'s audiences little opportunity to assess the place of this remarkable woman in cinema history.The film is a must for aficionados.[A] documentary that more than makes the case for Alice.This makes a great companion piece to the \"Gaumont Treasures: 1897-1913,\" a meticulously restored DVD collection that contains a good number of the director\\'s films.The term \"essential documentary,\" often overused, finds true ground here with Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blach??.A frustrating story, but also an exhilarating one, in that Guy-Blach??\\'s work is deserving and we\\'re finally finding out about it.A vital effort to right past wrongs and fix the messes made by (mostly) men.Pamela B. Green\\'s documentary operates as an archival treasure hunt as well as a tribute to film preservation the world over.Thank goodness \"Be Natural\" is here to set a brilliant, distinguished, invaluable record straight.Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blach?? works hard to carve her name in the firmament, making an expansive argument for her as a pioneer in technique, a varied and gifted artist, and a shrewd businesswoman.By the end of \"Be Natural,\" you won\\'t only have a clear idea of who this remarkable woman was; you may well have acquired a new taste in old movies.I can\\'t begin to express the impact Be Natural had on me. I knew of Alice Guy-Blach?? but had only a nodding acquaintance with her work. I am grateful to Pamela Green for opening my eyes. This is a revelatory filmThe breadth of detail about not just film and Guy-Blach??\\'s body of work but also the actual process of how a woman\\'s work gets erased is jaw-dropping, and Be Natural has the potential to completely upend the canon of international cinema. Citizen K is riveting, informative, and a bit terrifying. It\\'s a significant documentary.Americans may go into \"Citizen K\" not knowing who this rather anonymous looking man is or how to pronounce or spell his name. But they will come out totally on Team Khodorkovsky.[I]t is Gibney\\'s film... that best tells this complex, contradictory tale of a businessman who rose from middle-class anonymity... to become one of Russia\\'s richest men during the early days of Russia\\'s post-Soviet experiment with capitalism.It\\'s Gibney\\'s willingness to hold his subject accountable that keeps Citizen K from drifting into dull hagiography.Essential viewing for anyone needing a history lesson about Russia since the fall of the Soviet Union, and who wants a frontline report on the current geopolitical landscape in Europe, including Ukraine.This is where [Alex] Gibney, gilding a history lesson and social-issue deep dive with investigative chops and weaving it all into a compelling story.Citizen K is skillfully made, with a compelling story.Although the film has long, engaging stretches, there is something slightly unsatisfying about the whole.Quite simply, jaw-dropping...a fascinating documentary with layers.Packed with information, context and archive footage of zany, bad-taste TV advertisements that use oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky\\'s story to frame Vladimir Putin\\'s ascent.The two hours whip by, and the impression left of Khodorkovsky is of an instinctive politician who never quite lets Gibney in and of contemporary Russia as an infinitely complex ideological nut that\\'s yet to be cracked.The film strays off-target at times and doesn\\'t give the horrors of Siberia enough consideration. But it\\'s an interesting thematic grab-bag...Beautifully chronicled, as expected from Gibney, and rich with detail, and even funny when needed.It\\'s an undeniably informative and vital documentary, which clearly illustrates a disturbing political farce that has been allowed to thrive for far too long. Which is to say, at all.As constructed, Citizen K serves as a briskly paced primer into all things Putin, Russian and, incidentally, Khodorkovskian.Though it\\'s impossible to ignore \"Citizen K\\'s\" nod to \"Citizen Kane...\" seeing this involving film leads to the feeling that, however unconventional, Khodorkovsky\\'s path to becoming a small d democrat was a sincere one.It\\'s more darkly amusing than it sounds.What a strange story - and it\\'s not over yet.The Oscar-winning documentarian is back, firing on all cylinders and reconnecting with his political muse. The result is easily his best documentary in years.[A] chewy, engrossing documentary... If the film were merely a hymn to the everyday heroism of the press, it would risk becoming one-dimensional... So it\\'s a good thing Nanau gives some space to a couple of memorable figures who represent different sides of the story.Collective is eye-opening, elegiac, and essential. It suggests, or at least hopes, that the only thing more powerful than political corruption is the collective voice of those trying to stop it.This distressing documentary has relevance way beyond Romania, making it a must-watch for awards season and beyond.[A] staggering portrait of institutional corruption...It plays like a political thriller. But it\\'s also a deeply moving testament to both the power and the necessity of investigative journalism...[It] digs deeper through the morass of power, corruption and lies. You keep waiting for someone to say, \\'Forget it, Jake, it\\'s Bucharest.\\'Utterly compelling and profoundly depressing...For all the horror, Nanau is an exhilarating film-maker, trusting us to keep pace without talking heads.It is so disturbing, but it also very rewarding in the sense of how journalism ought to function.It is, among other things, a film about how a young idealist tries to cope with the reality of a situation in a political arena. It\\'s quite remarkable on every level.This is a documentary about a few things: journalism, what we should expect from our government, and how to figure out the truth when people don\\'t want you to know... It\\'s incredible to watch.Alexander Nanou\\'s gut-wrenching film underscores the power of a relentless press to right wrongs, save lives and cauterize corruption.A great movie about how a free and independent press holds power to account, and calls out hypocrisy and venality.\"Collective,\" a document of a modern corruption that can fester and thrive anywhere, ends with a mortifying shudder and tears at a gravesite.No matter the devastation they have to face, \"Collective\" demonstrates the potential for moral courage to endure, under even the most dire efforts to snuff it out. No matter who runs the show, the work goes on.What makes Nanau\\'s film utterly compelling is the unfettered access he had to both the Sports Gazette journalists and to Minister of Health Voiculescu.Nanau keeps the audience aware of the real stakes to all this journalistic digging and political gamesmanship.Gripping, incisive and shockingly powerful, \"Collective\" is easily the documentary of the year.Nanau\\'s damning film - applicable to political failures around the world - goes beyond that, exposing the very roots of corruption and exploring the harm it does.It shouldn\\'t be missed. There are no hugely dramatic moments in 76 Days. It is wholly unsentimental and, allowing for the fact the stream of events must be put into some kind of narrative form, unmanipulative.Compelling and surprising, 76 Days is a seemingly apolitical yet oddly sanitised fly-on-the-wall documentary that puts you on the front lines of an eerily well-managed response to the coronavirus outbreak.The takeaway from this thing is...thank GOD for these people.This is primary evidence right from the source of history.Timing is everything in current affairs culture, and this intimate documentary account of the first 76 days of the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan early last year is an illustrative case.Crucially, there\\'s also an element of hope and even humour in this affecting tribute to healthcare workers everywhere.It is a terrible story, but, in its constant discovery of bravery and compassion, ultimately a hopeful one.The result is less of an expos?? than a straightforward video-diary, in which doctors and nurses are shown battling against a virus they aren\\'t even sure how to contain, let alone treat.The result is a time capsule in waiting, a real-time record of medicine adapting to the viciously unknown.A vital film of historical significance.76 Days reinforces that their deaths are horrifying, sad, and lonely, with medical staff holding hands, calling them \"mother\" or \"grandfather,\" trying to give solace along with the palliative care.\"76 Days\" is undeniably a well-made film, and it shows some interesting details.We are likely to be watching films on this subject for years to come, but for it\\'s sheer in-the-moment rawness, \"76 Days\" is one that will stick in your consciousness for some time.That it\\'s so artfully and elegantly observed, and packs such a candid wallop of feeling, atop its frontline urgency is testament to the grace and sensitivity of its directorial team, not just their timely savvy.76 Days has been made in such a skillful and gripping manner that even those suffering from COVID news fatigue will find themselves caught up in it.This is a film about courage, as well as empathy, professionalism and resilience - and it\\'s a film that embodies those values itself. With luck, viewers will take its cautionary pleas to heart.Rarely has recent global history seemed so far away, yet so present. It\\'s one of the year\\'s essential documents.As the virus resurges across the world, \"76 Days\" suggests a way to face the future, with tears but perhaps also hope.Still, the overall impression 76 Days delivers is that of dedicated professionals coping with an unprecedented onslaught of emergencies to the best of their ability, grimly waiting for the curve to flatten.The documentary may be the defining portrait of the dawning of the Covid-19 pandemic. A vital and joyful work that puts a lesser-known part of American civil rights history on the map...At times it feels like Crip Camp bites off slightly too much for a movie that\\'s less than two hours long. But I can\\'t really blame the directors for cramming in as much information as they can.Crip Camp is the kind of documentary whose name circulates in must-watch lists for months: it\\'s an inspiring true story, accessibly told.It visibilizes the history of one of the most invisibilized communities in this country.How strange - and how telling - that despite the wealth of big-screen documentaries released in the past 20 years, the story behind the remarkable Crip Camp has gone so long untold.Mostly, this is an empowering feel-good documentary about a small group of people who came together in the right place at the right time.\"Crip Camp\" shows change can come from anyone, anywhere at anytime. It\\'s a lesson that should always be taken to heart but rings especially true now.Crip Camp is a buoyant, illuminating, and very to-the-point historical documentary.The riveting tale of a decades-long radical revolution that changed the world forever.[It] sounds as if it\\'s going to be Good for You rather than good, but it actually turns out to be both - as well as surprising, which is surprising in itself, given that inspirational civil rights documentaries tend to be more alike than unalike.Crip Camp conveys, as few films do, a sense of lives lived furiously and passionately across a vast stretch of time.At about the halfway point, Crip Camp segues from being a snapshot of a cool getaway for disabled teens to a bigger-picture chronicle of the birth of a movement.The spirit of revolution - righteously angry yet full of bonhomie, demanding but generous in its reach - is alive and well in the film. As, one hopes, it is everywhere else.The message that inclusivity and community can spur real change is important, and no less urgent today than it was in the 1970s.Using a treasure trove of archived footage and colorful contemporary interviews, Lebrecht and Newnham weave together a punchy, straightforward and inspiring documentary that is greater than the sum of its parts.It\\'s thrilling.Heumann\\'s continued leadership helped secure the passing of the ADA. But the triumphs of these activists is made even sweeter by the footage of them as very young people at Camp Jened...A raucous odyssey filled with twists, setbacks, smart strategizing, and unlikely strokes of luck.Although the template possesses the trappings of what might be called a feel-good film, there\\'s happily nothing saccharine about it.A look back at how a New York summer camp run by hippies helped form a generation of political firebrands ready to fire up the Disability Rights Movement. Produced by Michelle and Barack Obama, this indispensable doc is the definition of inspiring. Rather than positing better ways of processing death, this film celebrates our inability to do so: inventive as we are, we are no match for it.For those who have watched loved ones fight a losing battle with Alzheimer\\'s, the movie might seem unappealing, but Johnson\\'s deeply compassionate, even hopeful tone could be a balm for her fellow grievers.Dick Johnson is Dead is a daring masterpiece about the loss of loved ones, and of memory, and the movies\\' ability-and, also, inability-to make the impermanent permanent.For a moment, Kirsten Johnson has conquered death. That makes Dick Johnson Is Dead a strangely satisfying, yet bittersweet watch in this dark time, when fears of mortality are closer to the surface for most people.Fortifying this film throughout is Dick\\'s commitment to it as an eccentric project that\\'s worth all the effort, from which we intuit a beaming sense of paternal pride and pleasure in collaboration.Johnson has a rare gift for being so nakedly and frankly personal that she speaks for everyone. She turns intimacy into rhapsody.For all its playfulness, it\\'s the real, stinging, joyful, inconvenient reality of life that Dick Johnson Is Dead gives us. It\\'s a committed act of preservation: a looping, reeling, repeatable act of love.Surreal set pieces make for some of Dead\\'s most unforgettable moments visually, but the story\\'s biggest gift by far is the sunny, unassuming soul at its center.A very moving personal essay done in a heartfelt, surreal, and funny fashion.I won\\'t tell you how it ends but I will say that Mark Twain would probably give it a thumbs up.Dick Johnson Is Dead is an odd and novel film-there has never been anything like it, and it\\'s not something that could be easily imitated by anyone else. Its tones shift gently, like the rocking of the sea.Dick Johnson Is Dead works best when it specifically focuses on her father\\'s death-the various, Groundhog Day-like variations and the real one coming around the bend, or his struggles with encroaching dementia.This is a funny film about death, which is to say it\\'s a wrenching film about life.For all its clear-eyed representation of the fears and horrors of aging, Dick Johnson Is Dead is nonetheless an ultimately joyous experience.The documentary is an extraordinary work for how easily Kirsten slips between tones without coming off as saccharine or untruthful about what\\'s unfolding onscreen.Johnson handles the heavy subject matter with a deft touch, never turning melodramatic or going for easy, obvious heart string moments.A rich and rewarding documentary that feels like the next stage in the stylistic evolution of Kirsten Johnson.This is both an exploratory personal project and a thought-experiment of a film.As a piece of entertainment, Ms. Johnson\\'s documentary is exuberant, to say the least, and instructive in the bargain.Pitched artfully between the celebratory and the elegiac, it is an inarguably serious documentary with light, surrealistic flourishes that, at times, veer into exuberant goofiness. This isn\\'t the story of an inevitable tragedy. It\\'s the story of a disaster that everyone saw coming and let happen anyway.This is about as timely as a documentary can be, and yet it\\'s already in need of an update.It takes a village to burn itself to the ground, and no one is better at contextualizing such huge events, and structuring the information into a clear and transparent narrative, than documentarian Alex Gibney.None of the fancy gimmicky in \"Totally Under Control\" can top the sheer emotional turmoil on display from its key subjects.A timely and competent first chapter, but it\\'s only a fragment of a story that\\'s still being written.It\\'s sobering, often indecently gripping material that, in broad strokes, confirms widely circulated impressions of the Trump White House as a nest of kleptocratic science-bashing vipers.A damning account of Trump\\'s horrid-and criminally negligent-handling of the crisis.It\\'s a fine placeholder for a real reckoning, a nicely-plated appetizer, a studious demonstration of how to read, collate, and repackage the news. Now all we need is to tell the actual story, which is to say, the human one.A vital, powerful examination of how one political administration could get something so wrong by ignoring the experts.The resulting film conveys the dizzying sensation of chronicling history while it\\'s still unfolding.A methodical, devastating account of the American government\\'s malfeasance and failure to act from the top down.Totally Under Control refuses to look away, and being reminded of how many warnings went unheeded is unnerving.Essential viewing for undecided voters, though it could have been more expansive.It reconstructs recent history to remind us of how recently and quickly this pandemic changed life as we know it. Simultaneously, it calls attention to the many missed opportunities officials could have seized that may have altered the course we\\'re on.Yet its tight focus earmarks it as an important on-the-record document about a year we\\'ll never forget. And, for better or for worse, it\\'s already due for a sequel.Incisive, lucid and infuriating...A definitively American story - what happens when the desire to be free from government extends to government itself, as nearly 8m people sicken.Do you enjoy watching slow-motion footage of car crashes? Would you like to feel the anxious rush induced by two hours of doomscrolling without actually going on Twitter? Then buckle up for Totally Under Control...To the extent that this fast-paced recap has a method, it\\'s to distill the institutional failings of the past year to a continuously involving and outraging two-hour highlight reel. At that, the movie succeeds...All told, there\\'s not a whole lot new here. Still... Gibney and company have delivered what is clearly intended to be a powerful closing argument, pulling the case together. It\\'s a dazzling, prismatic meditation on the nature of time itself, [...] a reflection on the life that grows and blooms even as we wait impatiently for years to pass.This is a beautifully shot film that\\'s as interested in studying the changing faces of its subjects as laying out their struggle from end to end.An intimate exploration of time unjustly stolen by a justice system that never seems to deliver what it promises.A gripping documentary that reframes the perception of mass incarceration and its far-reaching effects.It allows us to see Fox and her family through their own eyes while giving the film the scope of an epic-one made up of fragments and focused, like all epics, on the promise of catharsis in a homecoming.[Director Garrett] Bradley\\'s mastering of craft is evident in all the ways she strays from convention.Beautiful, patient and inspiring, Bradley\\'s experiential doc captures how much life happens while you sit around waiting for justice and empathy.Time, Bradley asks us to remember, is what we lose. Only in a movie can we entertain and engineer the fantasy of getting it back, rewinding the clock, restoring presence to a loved one\\'s absence. Thank God, then, for movies. This one especially.It tells a story as urgent and beautifully human as almost anything on screen this year.Bradley creates a tone poem that ebbs and flows in hypnotically lyrical style, dexterously shuffling images from disparate periods to create something unified and immersive.Time may be shot in black and white but the world it captures is anything but clear-cut. By turns moving and angry, it\\'s a thought-provoking hymn to love, family and the power of Black female courage.Working from monochrome home movies [and] new material shot by Zac Manuel, Justin Zweifach and Nisa East ... the filmmaker creates a moving impression of a life not lived.It\\'s a document of mutual care; a self-authored family archive magnified by the scope of its editor and platform; and a compassionately rendered adaptation of the ways in which we feel the tempo, intervals, duration and memory of time.Tears will flow.[A] viscerally emotional documentary...Time is a pure, unembellished call for empathy. It would be foolish to ignore it.It\\'s one of the most beautiful stories about redemption you\\'ll ever see.Heartbreaking and passionate, Time is the chronicle of a love deferred and the life that hope can provide.Time moves elegantly back and forth between those evocatively degraded video clips, with their cramped frame and muddy sound, and the pristine latter-day cinematography, which glows and blazes brightly.A film of rare profundity and breathtaking intimacy. Welcome to Chechnya: The Gay Purge. brought home the horror with a dramatic urgency. David France\\'s grimly compelling film was a docu-thriller, with heart-stopping moments as activists spirited people out of the country in clandestine operations.France sensitively draws out the personalities of his subjects, ensuring that, despite the digital disguises and pseudonyms, they emerge as distinct individuals.David France has made a difficult, distressing and often tremendously bleak film about the torture and murder of LGBT people in Chechnya, and the brave efforts of community activists and organisers to \"extract\" them from the region.It\\'s one of those documentaries that makes you wonder how it even got made... It\\'s a little bit all over the place, but ultimately I found this to be a harrowing, fascinating watch.It\\'s a collective profile in courage ... on the people who are the last thing standing between survival and a purge.A documentary that plays like a chilling undercover thriller.An illuminative work that never feels entirely safe, placing the observer in the midst of its subjects in moments where not even they can be entirely sure they\\'ll make it.You\\'re forced to reckon with the nature of identity - how it can cost someone their life.\"Welcome to Chechnya\" is a moving and vital indictment of mass persecution.What you get in Welcome to Chechnya is often a formidably tense, real-life drama. Rescuing people from Chechnya is a genuinely hair-raising and dangerous business.France deploys digital means to distort identities but preserve emotions and facial reactions - think \"The Irishman\" but ultimately less distracting. The effect is initially disorienting but preferable to subjects speaking in the shadows.Welcome to Chechnya is both astonishingly groundbreaking in its use of technology, and difficult to watch.Shot by France in guerrilla documentary style, the scenes where they pass through checkpoints, learn of people disappearing, and deal with blown covers build in suspense like a fictional thriller.What\\'s perhaps most remarkable about Welcome To Chechnya is the level-headed perspective many of these subjects have about what\\'s happening to them.It\\'s shocking, and it should be. But Welcome finds tender, funny moments too - and even, in the end, some kind of hope.David France\\'s most remarkable accomplishment emerges from an aesthetic commitment of a very particular kind.Welcome to Chechnya not only provides a stark reminder of the everyday reality of anti-queer oppression outside of our \\'progressive\\' Western bubble, but also of the precarious nature of global LGBT+ rights.Urgently lifts the lid on one of the most horrifying humanitarian crises of present times: the state-sanctioned purge of LGBTQ people in the eponymous southern Russian republic.\"Welcome to Chechnya\" is a vital and urgent portrait of an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, and the world needs to hear about it.Whether or not you identify as queer, Welcome to Chechnya will leave you shaken by the evidence of an amoral autocracy taking extreme action under the hypocritical guise of religious purity. Timely. Illuminating. Required viewing.It\\'s a fun watch, and also timely and useful.Political documentaries are a dime a dozen, yet I was moved by how stridently this one\\'s subjects are fighting for people\\'s right to vote.\"All In\" manages the triple-E feat of being entertaining, educational and enlightening.It\\'s sobering viewing, especially with a policy rooted in the 19th century growing stronger in the 21st.The dismaying ebb and flow of justice is a major point in the film, with multiple pundits noting that periods of swift progress are often followed by equally if not more stringent rollbacks.A valuable public service wrapped in an educational, informative, and engaging documentary.All In is still plenty effective, but it lags behind the likes of social media and late-night comedy shows, which have presented a lot of this same information in packages that are more emotional and entertaining.It is, in the end, a damning film and a powerful one. And with Nov. 3 less than two months away, an essential one.In a sense, it\\'s less a documentary for posterity than an urgent broadcast. That doesn\\'t mean it\\'s not worth hearing.An exemplary civics lesson.A documentary of supreme relevance that has the effect, at once chilling and rousing, of a political cautionary tale. \"The Truffle Hunters\" is about a way of life that is off the grid and that few know about, and why it is worth preserving.By putting us behind the eyes of a dog racing through the underbrush, happily going about what it understands as its work, \"The Truffle Hunters\" brings us to the source itself: the sniffing out, the digging, the discovery, the reward.It won\\'t necessarily make you want to rush out and pay a fortune for truffles to shave over your eggs. But it will make you appreciate people whose love for something has so fully informed their lives.You haven\\'t lived until you\\'ve experienced the dog cam.This endearing, thoroughly entertaining movie might be what we all need right now: An invitation to stop and smell the roses - or, if you\\'re lucky, their far less showy fungal cousins.Bracing and joyous, the film unearths complex, canine-loving characters who bicker and haggle their way into the audience\\'s hearts.This is a portrait of a subculture, not an advocacy documentary.It\\'s not just a beautiful movie, but it\\'s a really great one for dog lovers.Wonder and whimsy is back in the forest. \"The Truffle Hunters\" - surely among the greatest dog movies - even wryly occasionally shifts to a dog\\'s point of view.The film, directed and photographed (beautifully) by Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw, is fragrant too, a parallel study in deep gratification and rapt inhalation.What we are presented with is essentially a boisterous gallery of aging oddballs. But to their credit the filmmakers never make fun of them. Their eccentricity, because it is rooted in a passion for the natural world, has an innate dignity.Despite its creators\\' general fussiness, The Truffle Hunters is good enough, if only because guys like Carlo and Angelo are more charming than they are eccentric.A film that lies at the intersection of documentary, Italian neorealism and Renaissance painting, a wholly singular visual experience that is inextricably tied to the film\\'s storytelling.Without spoiling the delicate mood with narration or straight-to-camera interviews, Dweck and Kershaw bring us into the company of a band of idiosyncratic adherents to an ancient way of life.\"The Truffle Hunters\" takes us to a part of the world where time appears to have stood still. But that\\'s deceptive.Any good documentary teaches you how to pay attention to something, which is why this one feels like such an overwhelming experience: It teaches you to pay attention to the world, all of it all at once.See this wonderful-looking documentary on a big cinema screen if you possibly can.It\\'s a sweet and simple movie with a healthy dose of bittersweet wistfulness for a fading world, and it\\'s beautiful.There\\'s a dark side to the profession, which the filmmakers acknowledge, but the most valuable thing they capture in their film is the joy of being alive, and finding something you love.It is absolutely sublime. It is a charming, uplifting documentary, as effective a tonic as a sunny horoscope forecast.The film is a fond farewell to Mercado and a celebration of his life, and enlightening both for Mercado newbies and those who grew up at his proverbial knee....fascinating and uplifting...The film is a wild ride and a loving portrait, providing a vital record of this outsized figure who was so ahead of his time it seemed as though he transcended the laws of the universe.It is a practically impossible task to bring the otherwordly down to Earth. But in these quiet moments, \"Mucho Mucho Amor\" finds the truth amid all the invention.Mucho Mucho Amor works for many reasons -- the insightful interviews, the tight editing, revealing archival footage, and some stunning tarot-inspired animations -- but also in its recognition that not all that glitters is gold.[A] delightful and open-hearted documentary...It\\'s entertaining, but a little slight.[Costantini and Tabsch] celebrate and eulogize the late showman with disarming zest and respect.Use stupid things to give a beautiful message of love and peace? I\\'ve heard worse philosophies of life.If the film tends toward convention, it is saved from clich?? by the bejeweled and beguiling presence of Walter Mercado himself.If Mucho Mucho Amor does little to puncture that grand mystique, it\\'s because the force of nature that was Walter Mercado wouldn\\'t have it any other way.This delightful, intimate documentary offers a glimpse into Walter\\'s remarkable career as well as a nostalgic journey for the millions in Latinx families who love him.But that reality couldn\\'t dampen Mercado\\'s love-or lust, as he put it-for life, nor does it prevent Mucho Mucho Amor from radiating with it.There are plenty of documentaries that profile famous people, but few ever feel like a celebration. Mucho Mucho Amor captures that joyful nostalgic rush his fans may feel when someone mentions his name or shares a memory of when they used to watch him.Still, most viewers will enjoy spending time with this quirky soothsayer and may feel a tinge of regret that they didn\\'t discover him when he was alive.The film\\'s biggest revelation is that Mercado\\'s mystical, magnificent, big-hearted shtick was no fraud - he was always the real deal.A tribute as inspired and jubilant as its majestic subject, a true original. A reminder that government, for all of its speed bumps and snags, can work. It can help. The people running it just have to want it to.On its surface, in so many ways, City Hall could read as an endorsement. But politics aren\\'t that simple -- and Wiseman\\'s movie most certainly isn\\'t, either.What Frederick Wiseman has been doing for all these years and in all these films is trying to make art of decency and process. In the good ones, he\\'s succeeded. \"City Hall\" is one of the very good ones.Frederick Wiseman\\'s documentary offers a hopeful look at political institutions.While the phrase \"required viewing\" gets thrown around a lot, I cannot think of another film that plainly and comprehensively lays bare the both the complex apparatus at work, and the people dedicated to serving its populace.At 4 1/2 hours, \"City Hall\" is a demanding film. But it rewards that commitment with an experience that is both hypnotically beautiful and subtly encouraging.Constitutes a love letter to civic governance, and the notion of democracy, at a time when public discourse seethes with scorn for urban life.With \"City Hall,\" his 45th feature, he has composed another epic from a series of intricate, carefully arranged miniatures, a four-and-a-half-hour sprawl of a movie that will leave you admiring its agility and concision.I could have watched hours more of people simply talking to one another in auditoriums and across conference-room tables.Even in a filmography with more than its fair share of impressive achievements, it deserves consideration as one of Wiseman\\'s greatest.The result is not a portrait of a city, really. Refreshingly - and maybe even a little surprisingly - it\\'s a portrait of a government that actually seems to be working for its citizens.A fastidious, intelligent, and all but encyclopedic as any of [Wiseman\\'s] previous real-world epics.City Hall considers in detail the government\\'s role-and responsibility-in fostering that sense of community, and the connection of that sense to the city\\'s over-all well-being.By the time \"City Hall\" arrives at its breathtaking final shots, Wiseman has crafted such an advanced case for understanding every aspect of local governance that it leads to the impression that America would be a better place if everyone experienced it.City Hall proves a celebration of the power of storytelling to unite-and, also, a masterful example of it.City Hall, in other words, may sometimes try the patience of even a Wiseman devotee. Still, there\\'s method to its patches of mild tedium...The director champions government and community involvement in an age where reactionaries are still trying to make government small enough to drown in a bathtub and to make individual citizens feel more hopeless and cynical about their elected officials.The result is both sober and inspiring: an urban progress report taking into account a plethora of government services, scutinized by Wiseman\\'s patient but unblinking eye.Its provocations can seem savage at a glance, but they emerge from an observational tranquility that is uniquely Frederick Wiseman\\'s own.More than anything, Wiseman is showing us that we are not only watching Bostonians, but Americans, too. This is one of the best documentaries you\\'ll see this year.Like a lot of recent documentaries about the overdue reckoning for sexual predators in positions of power, \"Athlete A\" is a reminder that the rot is sometimes within the system itself, not just within the criminals it benefits.What\\'s striking about the film\\'s tone is its redemptive warmth. Though the details are chilling, it\\'s as if a cathartic space has been opened for these girls and their families to explain what they went through.With a mere 103-minute running time, many viewers may find themselves wanting more.There\\'s a lot here, but \"Athlete A\" handles its material lithely, moving smoothly between Nassar\\'s survivors, the journalists who broke the story and the big picture of gold medals, Summer Games and national pride.Above all, though, it makes you wonder about men and power - does it corrupt, or do the corrupt seek it for further gratification of their desires? And why are they so willing to protect each other, however high the toll of misery paid by their victims.After \"Athlete A,\" you may never again watch America\\'s pursuit for gold with quite the same enthusiasm.[A] devastating indictment of the culture of mental and physical abuse that flourished for years at U.S. Gymnastics.There are moments in Athlete A that will make you gasp at the brazen brutality of Nassar\\'s crimes. Yet it never feels prurient or sensationalized.A wrenching account of the 2016 USA Gymnastics scandal and the assaults of staff doctor Larry Nassar on hundreds of girls and young women.Directors Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk show us the story of the predatory monster, the brave survivors, and the heroic reporters of The Indianapolis Star. But they want us to see more.Though it focuses on one main perpetrator, the film adeptly juggles various moving parts, such as the ruthless nature of training and the aftermath of speaking out.Athlete A mixes familiar archival footage with new testimonials in a conventional manner, all while differentiating itself from its non-fiction predecessor in fundamental ways...Through even-handed reporting and a series of emotional first-person accounts, \"Athlete A\" excavates one of modern sports\\' most horrific abusers and systems.It\\'s a terrific journalism movie, but it\\'s also a story of young women who persevered and found justice against the odds.[A] disturbing and illuminating documentary...Athlete A is a devastating challenge to how a civilised society can call this win-at-all-costs Soviet-styled model a \\'sport\\' - because those girls never had a chance.There\\'s a lot more ground to cover, but this is a strong start.A measured if still-maddening look into the 2016 USA Gymnastics scandal... [An] undeniably moving, unsettling film...Their stories have not been told. It\\'s shocking to hear, yet so obvious. And that\\'s what makes On the Record such a compelling watch -- it lays out in the clearest possible terms the ramifications for black women who dare to stand up.It is told with conviction and rigorous honesty...A must watch.[T]his is the quintessential conversation starter, smartly edited and always thought-provoking.This compelling story of sexual assault and powerful men violently abusing their positions is a reminder than the #MeToo movement didn\\'t begin - or end - with Harvey Weinstein.The film is forthright and intelligent on the difficulties and complexities involved in the discussion.On the Record is a lesson in power and its caprices.A story of pain and complexity...The film deftly shows how the complexities of racism have played a part in silencing BAME victims of sexual abuse.The rare #MeToo documentary that grapples frankly with its accusers\\' uncertainty about coming forward.This is so compelling. It\\'s intimate... But I think what really makes it particularly interesting is how it shines a light on an aspect of the #MeToo movement that we haven\\'t really seen.I admire the different tangents that this film goes down... There\\'s a lot here to chew on.Despite its faults, On the Record is a necessary social document.Beyond laying out the accusations against Simmons, On the Record is a deeply mournful portrait of lost potential, of a woman run out of a business that she not only loved, but helped create.The film communicates... complex ideas with quiet, forceful emotional clarity.It\\'s not an easy watch, but it\\'s a riveting and insightful one.Not just a riveting piece of investigative filmmaking, but a comprehensive and crucially important historical text - an accomplishment all the more remarkable for being so economical...What would the world at large be like if women like Dixon weren\\'t driven away from work they were good at, work they loved?\"On The Record\" makes a powerful case. But left unanswered is a question for all of us. Once the silence is broken, what comes next? This is the best primer on political gerrymandering imaginable and should be mandatory viewing in grad school public policy symposiums and high school civics classes alike.Gerrymandering is purposely confusing. Even its name is wonky. But the compelling, impassioned documentary \"Slay the Dragon\" does an effective job of explaining it...While it doesn\\'t exactly bring new information to the table, the movie provides a welcome breakdown of the dramatic impact that gerrymandering has across American society whenever election season comes around.Slay the Dragon isn\\'t a glorified PowerPoint presentation about the history of voting. It\\'s an unabashed activist documentary aimed at convincing viewers they can fight gerrymandering in their home states.It\\'s a terrific film. I was a little wary that it going to be really wonky, which it sort of is, but it is also extremely well-edited... and it\\'s even-handed.This film is absolutely infuriating and it is must-see viewing.Goodman and Durrance have made a dense, numbers-driven subject very accessible.[A] compelling and instructive look at the political practice of gerrymandering.Slay the Dragon does an extraordinarily good job of taking a complex issue and connecting the dots, which seems particularly appropriate for a documentary about gerrymandering.For those who don\\'t feel up to facing more bad news, there is some hope here in the form of citizen activists doing all they can.\"Slay the Dragon\"... may not be the most heartening portrait of our political system. But it\\'s a vital one and it provides reasons for optimism, too.The film, directed by Barak Goodman and Chris Durrance, does a skillful job of distilling a complicated history.There may be larger things in the world right now to think about... but as Slay the Dragon mostly proves, the system will never right itself until the electorate collectively push for action.As much doom as we get here, Goodman and Durrance find widespread cause for optimism as well...The film is suitably direct, clear-eyed, and exhaustive in documenting the massive impacts that gerrymandering has, particularly on communities of color.\"Slay the Dragon\" is the most important political film of the year, and it may prove to be one of the key political films of the decade. It\\'s an astonishing piece of work, both fearless and artful in the way it encompasses and orders layers of information. If our world needs new forms to encompass the complexity of modern life, The Dissident points a way forward.This hugely informative, superbly assembled documentary is designed to anger the viewer - and it does.Tyranny and its effects are no video game, but \"The Dissident\" overall retains the impact of its alarming narrative...it is, in the defiant spirit of Khashoggi himself, utterly merciless in its critique of a brutal Saudi regime.I would\\'ve preferred a more somber tone...I\\'m not sure that\\'s what this subject needed. Nevertheless, it\\'s an engrossing and horrifying story.A commendably unflinching critique of the Saudi state\\'s tyranny and of its persecution of political dissidents.It is a horrible story of state-sponsored violence from arrogant bullies who calculated - rightly - that they would get away with it.We can forgive Fogel if his portrait of Khashoggi himself seems a touch incomplete: with its restless style of activism, the film arguably builds on his legacy better than it would have done as a work of retrospective biography.The Dissident builds into a robust portrait of Khashoggi himself - and a clash of generations. But one of unusual contours.The Dissident explodes genres by combining them, equal parts political analysis, murder investigation, cyber thriller and paean to free speech.The Dissident is a solid recap of Jamal Khashoggi\\'s demise, but it left me wanting more than Fogel is able to provide, even though he hints at an issue of vastly greater importance than the death of one dissident.This sinister story is told with the breakneck pacing and paranoid edge of a Tony Scott thriller.Told from various perspectives, including the journalist\\'s fiancee Hatice Cengiz, it\\'s another winner from the director of the Oscar-winning \"Icarus.\"This film made me think of the plight of journalists writ large.It should be required viewing for anyone who cares about free speech and democracy.Thorough and competent, The Dissident works as an essential political documentary.This is a somber piece of work; it\\'s not likely to cheer anyone up. But if the details of the Khashoggi case aren\\'t for the faint of heart, facing the facts squarely is at least somewhat cleansing.But for all its wealth of detail and thematic ambition, The Dissident is a good documentary that never quite becomes great.Try, though, not to let this ugly truth get in the way of a good story.We are daily reminded of the importance of a free media, of free speech. \"The Dissident\" is a reminder of how far some governments will go to suppress it. Beautifully animated to protect the identity of the main subject, Rasmussen\\'s film examines the lengths we will go to in order to survive and protect those we love.Innovative doc filmmaking. Impressive visuals. A very personal and harrowing story laid bare.Flee won the World Cinema Documentary Grand Jury Prize at Sundance, and no wonder: It\\'s heartbreaking and moving, and hard to forget.Rasmussen uses two very different styles of animation to illuminate the unthinkably hard years the narrator endured, and the emotional pain he\\'s just beginning to process as he speaks about a background he\\'s hidden from almost everyoneA feat of humanistic filmmaking, this is a movie we will be celebrating all through next year\\'s awards season and talking about long after.With great resourcefulness, Rasmussen puts you through it in a way that illustrates, instructs, makes you look inward and ask whether you\\'d have what it takes, if you could tough it out and survive in a cold, hostile world.Innovative and visually dynamic... The animation renders his fond childhood memories with painterly grace, and turns his darkest hours into nightmarish horrors.Etched without a false note of cynicism or falling into cheap sentimentality, \"Flee\" harnesses the animated medium in stunning form.This gut-punch adult animation is a worthy heir to Waltz with Bashir.Amin\\'s fight for survival and freedom, brilliantly told through animation and archival news footage, illustrates the power of film to inform and elevate.Flee is a remarkably humanising and complex film, expanding and expounding the kind of story that\\'s too easily simplified.Its ambition is as challenging as it is gorgeous.It\\'s a powerful and poetic memoir of personal struggle and self-discovery that expands the definition of documentary.It\\'s activism, therapy, and great cinema all at once.\"Flee,\" which would have premiered at Cannes last year had the coronavirus not capsized the festival, is an original artistic exploration of the way that trauma impacts one\\'s sense of self. Very informative. It\\'s not an \"eat your vegetables\" thing at all; it is shot and cut very thrillingly and you really come to care and appreciate the hard work that these folks put in.It\\'s a fairly thrilling and gut-wrenching examination of how these things work.This is a jubilant and mischievous documentary that suggests changing the world for the better is something we can all do.Effective stylistic choices, like the hand-drawn animations that accompany courtroom audio, and a dark sense of humour smooth out any rough edges.It gives each of the cases enough time to play out and also add up to a rich portrait of a complex organization.A lively and watchable account of the full-tilt battle being fought by the ACLU...The Fight does a splendid job of humanizing its heroic lawyers.What most vividly comes across in \"The Fight\" is the never-ending nature of freedom and democracy.The Fight is an endlessly engaging look into the often labyrinthine legal apparatus, and the film seamlessly moves between the cases with such incredible skill that the team of editors deserve all the accolades afforded to them.The movie is concerned not with simple boosterism but with showing the inner workings of building a case...The filmmakers capture all four lawyers in both vulnerable and heroic moments.Snappily edited, with a visual style reminiscent of Steven Soderbergh\\'s modular design, The Fight tells viewers of a certain political perspective what they want to hear.Wisely focusing on four key cases, The Fight is a worthy attempt to document the ACLU\\'s seemingly endless struggle to challenge the many constitutional violations of the Trump administration.Some stories here end more happily than others. For the bigger picture, of course, there has been no end at all.The selfless commitment of its subjects to justice are what makes it worth a look.[An] engrossing and ultimately inspiring examination of ideals in action...Although \"The Fight\" is swift and jam-packed with ups, downs, wins, losses, injunctions, stays, hearings and Trump speeches, the film is remarkably detailed and careful.The film justly draws attention to the perpetual work that must go into preserving democratic institutions.In a moment divided into heroes and villains, there\\'s an urge for the film to go deeper into how, exactly, these lawyers use the Constitution as a cape.[F]rankly, it\\'s nice to see David beating Goliath on the big screen. \"A Secret Love\" weaves the couple\\'s remarkable life story into a sensitive and intimate depiction of the two navigating the realities of growing older together...\"A Secret Love\" is guaranteed to pull at your heartstrings.The Chicago-based documentary expertly weaves together LGBTQ history, baseball, and the ups and downs of loving someone for a lifetime.\"A Secret Love\" is full of the kind of gentle ribbing and loving chuckles one would expect from any adorable old couple, but it\\'s made all the more poignant by the fact of Pat and Terry\\'s trailblazing personal histories.It\\'s enraging that society made them feel they had to hide. But their happiness is the ultimate triumph.A Secret Love stands out by being sweetly understated, at a time when that\\'s especially welcome. It\\'s a deeply felt testament to both the strength of this couple\\'s bond, and the fragility and hard choices that often come at the end of a lifetime.There is no crying in baseball, but you might just be reduced to a puddle of tears while watching Bolan\\'s film, which finally brings the duo\\'s love out of the shadows and gives it a long-overdue chance to shine freely.\"There\\'s no crying in baseball!\" Tom Hanks\\'s grumpy coach said in A League of Their Own, but I was bawling my eyes out watching this film.Tender without being cloying, naturalistic without seeming contrived, A Secret Love may be the ideal antidote to your least-favorite queer tropes.It is a compliment that \"A Secret Love,\" which runs under an hour and a half, could stand to be longer, with an expanded portrait of Terry and Pat\\'s early life as a couple.Affecting at times and downright tear-jerking at others, their story is tied to the saga of gay life in America over the past 70-plus years.Everyone who sees this film will have their own favorite moments.At once a misty-eyed romance and a harsh depiction of the practical and emotional challenges of giving up independent living, \"A Secret Love\" isn\\'t subtle in its Kleenex-clutching tactics... but it\\'s certainly effective. Unquestionably difficult to watch - wait until you learn details of Uncle Harold\\'s \"punishment\" - Neulinger\\'s heroic act of bravery will hopefully encourage and inspire others to come forward.Throughout it all Neulinger remains undaunted and relentless but also artful, as he shows how cinema can both conceal and reveal, how it can evade the truth, or confront it, and by so doing transcend it.Conveys an unforgettable sense of all that\\'s stolen when children are abused-as well as the heroic bravery, compassion and togetherness required to combat such cruelty.It\\'s quite shocking and revelatory... It\\'s really a powerful movie that accelerates in its power as it goes along.It\\'s not a thriller, but it is a horror movie... Beyond being a study in the horrors of a cycle of abuse, it\\'s also a look at the discrepancies and disparities that occur in our justice system.A really courageous feat.A therapeutic masterwork.Rewind is hard to watch. It might also be essential.Rewind is the adult Sasha\\'s film, a harrowing but enthralling documentary feature that explores his family archive in order to understand the recurring sexual abuse that blighted his childhood.\"Rewind\" could only be made by this filmmaker in this way, and that gives it an unsettling fascination.Though difficult to watch, it\\'s a film that helps outsiders confront the horrifying ways such events can cause damage for decades after the fact.A deeply personal, revealing, and unforgettable piece of filmmaking.Watching the movie is like staring at a blurred image of the past that gradually, over 86 minutes, comes into terrifying focus.Heroic and devastating autobiographical documentary...Rewind not only offers the story of a victim\\'s ordeal, but a brave and resilient spirit.It\\'s hard to imagine the courage which went into the making of this highly personal documentary. A wake-up call and a call to action.It\\'s really good. An eye-opener.You really walk away with the sense \"Oh, this is just everywhere, and we have to stop and talk about it right now before it gets out of hand.\"Coded Bias is not interested in wallowing in despair for the future, like many tech-infused documentaries like to do. Kantayya wants to inform and inspire change.\"Coded Bias\" takes something huge and scary and breaks it down into small, easily understood morality tales, featuring everyday heroes fighting to save our future.Katnayya\\'s documentary and its unsettling findings should be mandatory viewing for Silicon Valley innovators.A movie about algorithms might sound boring to the non-hacker crowd, but Kantayya keeps things lively and easy to understand by avoiding technobabble and personalizing her story.For a documentary about automated technology, \"Coded Bias\" keeps its focus firmly on people: their failings, their vulnerabilities and their powers for good.Shalini Kantayya\\'s Coded Bias effectively brings to light a modern civil rights issue that can be proven with data.The documentary dives down the rabbit hole to chillingly, comprehensively expose how algorithms can perpetuate bias in often unforeseen and unjust ways.A chilling plunge into Orwellian reality.\"Coded Bias\" serves as both a wake-up call (to invasive practices the public doesn\\'t yet realize are being implemented) and a call to action.Without shying away the issue\\'s enormity or its devastating consequences, Coded Bias gradually works toward almost inspirational vibe, as Buolamwini and others get to work solving the problem they\\'ve identified.[A] fascinating study of how even the seemingly impartial world of technology is subject to embedded racism and privilege. An exhilarating... historical documentary that unfolds with the pace and complexity of a thriller.Coup 53 is stranger than fiction and a terrifying reminder that the past never goes away.[Amirani] transforms sifting through dusty plastic bags and filing cabinets into a thrilling detective case...With admirable tenacity and care, Amirani has dragged official secrets back into the light.Part political drama, part history lesson, part gripping spy thriller, Coup 53 gives what has been relegated to a small footnote in Iran\\'s story the big, expansive, dramatic treatment it deserves.A documentary with the crackle of a spy thriller.With legendary film editor Walter Murch (Apocalypse Now, The English Patient) on hand as editor and co-writer, Coup 53 always tells a complex story clearly.A maddening, gripping portrait of how imperialism works.Even if much of the material is common knowledge, the momentum of the plot can hardly fail to engross...Coup 53 is a historical documentary that plays more like All the President\\'s Men had it been written by John le Carr?? with a dash of Costa-Gavras and Manchurian Candidate John Frankenheimer.As history lessons go, this is a powerful one in which a wealth of interviews and stunning graphics have been pulled together, with extraordinary attention to detail, into an intricate but lucid whole.What a riveting story: a grim curtain-raiser to today\\'s tragedies. .As enlightening as \"Coup 53\" is as a secret history, it\\'s even more satisfying as an aesthetic exercise, treating viewers to one of cleverest workarounds in cinematic problem-solving in recent memory.Across time and space, a single, consistent story emerges. For a narrative shrouded in subterfuge, that\\'s a considerable achievement.Coup 53 is worth seeing, but its general effect on this viewer was to seek out more books, rather than movies, on the subject.Watching this thrilling, energetic doc feels like taking a swim in John le Carr??\\'s brain.Once Taghi Amirani turns his attention to the coup itself, his film snaps into shape, with Walter Murch skillfully knitting together new and old interviews to lay out the story in highly dramatic form.This is not some dry piece of historical revision. Amirani\\'s passion is palpable from the start and he peppers his film with twists and reveals that would make John le Carr?? smile.Obsessive and yet bracingly clear-minded, albeit anything but tidy, the film will enthrall documentary and history geeks.It\\'s hard to blame Amirani for the excess when he has an embarrassment of riches at his disposal after a decade of meticulous research and logistical setbacks, both financial and personal. Deft editing and unexpectedly affecting music choices make for an engaging portrait of the kind of impassioned and dedicated politician who seems in short supply right now.Smart, yet somewhat one-sided and process-orientated portrait of a man and his municipality.In its gently ironic way, the film depicts an urban centre keen to be treated, and run, as a genuine place to live, a town like any other.The film lets you appreciate Hadid\\'s delicate and complex situation.The documentary, to me, seemed to be balanced and observational.While understated and deeply personal, Mayor cannot avoid the current conflagration in the region.Luckily, Osit knew precisely what to do with the extraordinary material he captured.[An] astutely potent and structurally dynamic doc.A disarming subject, Hadid comes across as a cleareyed, forthright leader. But \"Mayor\" also stands out because Osit has thought it through in cinematic terms...After more than an hour of modest documentary observation, the film suddenly becomes a thriller, with Osit, Hadid, and others holed up in the mayor\\'s office as Israeli soldiers occupy the city center.More background on Hadid\\'s earlier life and political ascendance would have also been welcome. Still, \"Mayor\" proves a unique, involving and edifying experience.Osit gets considerable comic value out of the intrinsic banality of local government. But once we start to see Hadid engaging with the wider world, the film becomes a tribute to his valiant effort to preserve some kind of dignity.Like so many of the best documentaries, David Osit\\'s Mayor feels like a work of fiction.It\\'s an acutely observed you-are-there procedural about a modern metropolis that dares to exist, even thrive amid the enduring repercussions of 1967\\'s Six-Day War, when Israel occupied the region.\"Mayor\" offers a striking new perspective on that struggle, with a personal on-the-ground quality matched by grand tonal ambitions that makes it the best of its subgenre.Engrossing... Mystify avoids sensationalizing Hutchence\\'s life and instead illuminates a more three-dimensional, nuanced view of Hutchence\\'s personality.I was frustrated by this doc in that there was so much amazing footage and yet, for me, I couldn\\'t get much of a sense of who Michael Hutchence was on a deep level.[A] strikingly original portrait of an enigmatic man.Enlightening and affecting, providing a missing piece in the puzzle of a life prematurely ended.Beyond some unnecessary wild speculations, Mystify does a decent job in offering up a clear narrative arc which is more than enough to keep us hooked till the very end.Another ruminative contemplation of talent, fame and fortune providing no inoculation against heartbreak and self-destruction.Of interest principally to pre-existing fans, but a bigger picture takes shape too...As the tragedy unfolds, there\\'s a strange solace in seeing this captivating enigma somehow emerging intact.Mystify is a terrific documentary, and as complete a portrait of this talented singer as you could wish.It should prove essential viewing for the subject\\'s fans: a tender portrait of the man\\'s highs and lows that sheds new light on the broken years that directly preceded his suicide at 37.Lowenstein\\'s film has been a slow-burning labour of love.While \"Mystify\" in many ways amplifies the tragedy of Hutchence\\'s death, it also goes a long way toward explaining and humanizing it. If this were a fiction film it would surely be dismissed as totally unbelievable; since it\\'s not, this portrait of two totally fascinating characters proves to be as riveting as any thriller.The Painter and the Thief is a superb Norwegian documentary about a painter who befriended the criminal who stole two of her paintings. He then became her muse.A true-crime tale reconfigured into a unique relationship saga, replete with twists, turns, heartbreak, failure and redemption that\\'s as surprising as it is well-earned.Benjamin Ree\\'s extraordinary documentary feels like a movie - there\\'s a heist, villains who are not what they seem, scenes of striking intimacy and some fabulous twists.Fascinating, confounding and continually surprising...A beautiful story about extraordinary compassion.What an engrossing film - and the gender reversal of a male muse inspiring a female painter has got to be one small step for art-world equality.The beauty of the film is that this is life lived, in all its infinite strangeness - a grand tableau of intercrossed destinies, friendship and disaster, fjords and gangsters.One leaves The Painter and the Thief feeling eager to see what might happen if we were kinder and less self-interested, and convinced anew of the basic connection between paint and the human heart.Both [Barbora and Karl-Bertil] are open books, and open wounds.It ends up being about friendship, addiction, and the power of art -- but also the cost of art. Throughout it all, the spine of this movie is the rich, layered, and complicated friendship between these two people.[A] strange, delicately made film, which manages to defy expectations about both of its subjects and the power balance between them.It\\'s a knockout.[T]here are moments so intimate and unguarded that you may briefly dissociate and question what you\\'re watching - a documentary, or its carefully scripted and acted narrative counterpart.The concept of being seen through someone else\\'s eyes drives the best parts of The Painter and the Thief, a documentary that illuminates a great deal about the human condition even if it does kind of fizzle out in the third act.[Ree] delivers a raw yet rich exploration of the messiness of human relationships, their beauty and depravity.Ask not-or not only-what the painter does for the thief. Ask what the thief might be doing for the painter.The beauty of the film lies in the bond she forges with one of the thieves... The relationship between Barbora and Bertil, as she calls him, grows on camera from improbable friendship to spiritual love.Through twists and turns, The Painter and the Thief depicts not just the two-way transactional relationship between artist and subject, but the shared pain and mutual rehabilitation that can inspire and surround art making.Twists and turns shape the narrative, but not always to Ree\\'s benefit; he responds by scrambling his film\\'s chronology in ways that threaten to rupture any sense of trust between director and viewer. Circus of Books is a triumph of filmmaking in the way it covers such a range of topics so seamlessly: LGBTQ history, pornography, religion, obscenity law, media, AIDS, coming out, parenthood, and more.Circus of Books is the story of an American family who wandered into the eye of history, and a virtuoso example of how to make a movie both very big and very small at once.A worthy homage to the Los Angeles-area landmark of LGBTQ+ culture.You come to see through [director Rachel Mason] telling the story how she came to see her parents as people.This is a great little L.A. story. It\\'s a great slice of life into a very specific community.The sense of closure is satisfying, but it\\'s missing a charge.Both Circus of Books locations have since closed, but this documentary is a necessary, if incomplete, homage to their influence.People can indeed live at war with themselves and not know it. Here\\'s a case of great things happening once peace is declared.These members of the community reflect on a bygone era with wit and warmth, and the film supports their memories with golden-lit archival footage of the neighborhood in the 1980s.It\\'s a truly fascinating film, a slice of history and deeply personal.If you\\'re thirsting for something saucy, funny, and heart-warming, you\\'ll love Circus of Books.The film consistently subverts our expectations by revealing new layers about its subjects that deepen their humanity, causing us to challenge our own preconceptions.Rachel Mason performs a nice bit of misdirection with the film, starting with humorous juxtapositions of this nice, elderly Jewish couple running a gay porn shop and then moving toward a poignant story of acceptance.The ending is upbeat and, whatever your views on porn, will make you want to give Karen a really big hug.There is enormous humour and tenderness here.\"Circus of Books\" is an affectionate look at one of the most unusual mom and pop businesses in America, directed by the person who knew Mom and Pop best.For those wishing to understand a slice of LGBTQ culture and history, Mason\\'s poignant film is a high-priority watch.Circus of Books is chock full of entertaining characters, but Karen ultimately emerges as the film\\'s complicated and fascinating heroine.[A] very funny, very moving documentary. Cinema has been noticeably light recently on blockbuster spectacle, but the sight of this malleable young man learning about himself in real time as the camera rolls can feel as wondrous as any special effects.The experience is perfectly setting these kids up for what American democracy is -- it\\'s about winning and losing, your party\\'s success... Boys State, as a chronicle of this experience, accurately then also focuses on winning and losing.The documentary about a political boot camp is a depressingly accurate microcosm of the American electoral circus...helpful-if only as a cautionary tale about what extracurriculars not to enroll your kids in.Boys State has noble aims when it comes to teaching teenagers how their leaders are chosen and held accountable, but Boys State shows that those aims can only do so much to keep the uglier side of that process at bay.\"Boys State\" is a remarkable glimpse at the state of politics today.A nagging absence buzzes throughout nearly the entire film, distracting the viewer from the substance, however engaging, of what\\'s onscreen.The film is uplifting, funny, thrilling, and revealing... their experiences provide both a microcosmic look into the political process and a hint of the way future politics might unfold, in dismal and strangely hopeful ways.This is an outstanding documentary... It has you wondering how much politics is like Lord of the Flies.Boys State is one of those movies that will play differently based on both your political affiliation and whether you see the glass as half-empty or half-full.The sight of a thousand frat boys chewing over women\\'s reproductive rights is not going to be for everyone, but there are some genuinely inspiring moments among the discord.For much of the film, Moss and McBaine have viewers on the edge of their seats over which of the boys will ascend to the program\\'s highest, and most coveted, position.Boys State, a hugely entertaining and scarily edifying documentary by Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine, pulls you in with the power of its premise. Once you know what it\\'s about, you\\'re eager to know what it reveals.The filmmakers, Amanda McBaine and Jesse Moss, focus mostly on four boys -- and they\\'ve chosen wisely.Directors Jesse Moss and Amanda McBaine have accomplished the seemingly impossible task of taking a group of ambitious, media-fluent teens and somehow making the camera melt away.In this little microcosm you see not only a portrait of some serious-minded youths, but how their world views, morals and political beliefs have been molded by what\\'s happening in the country.These are just boys, and it is all pretend, but Boys State, like the event itself, delivers some legitimate life lessons.An entertaining movie whose central figures are judiciously chosen to give us just enough balance that we don\\'t despair.It\\'s easy to be charmed by \"Boys State,\" which is so good that you wish it were better.Boys State belongs to that realm of documentaries, like Spellbound and Mad Hot Ballroom and Cheer, that take their structure and draw their suspense from the competitions they chronicle.Boys State offers a ruminative peek into America\\'s future. Despite its modest trappings, it provides some effective drama as matters move towards a potentially violent climax.Disclosure is a noteworthy watch considering the way that films prior have represented trans people.A captivating and comprehensive overview of trans representations in the media that everyone should add to their Netflix watchlist.Elucidating regarding many things relative to the transgender folk.It makes you go back and revisit movies and TV shows through a totally different prism.[An] essential, thoroughly engaging documentary...\"Disclosure\" does an admirable job of covering many issues and contradictions a century of mostly insensitive screen depictions have raised.The passion and knowledge of the speakers lend force to this familiar - even generic - format.It\\'s a nuanced look at media\\'s ability to influence the conversation -- to move the needle in terms of public perception -- as well as its limits.\"Disclosure,\" takes an engrossing, smartly contextual look at the history of transgender depictions in film and television.With absolute precision Disclosure makes the case that the all-too-common portrayals of transgender characters on TV over the years have contributed to this epidemic through the reckless objectification of transgender people.Disclosure makes clear that the conversation about transgender representation is only just beginning, but it offers an incredibly thoughtful opportunity to make more people aware.Disclosure is vital whether it\\'s the beginning of your education or a supplement along the way. It\\'s a reminder of what representation can do and what representation can be. It is itself a work of trans cinema.In making the film, Feder and Cox are rewriting the very history they set out to tell, adding one more title to \"positive representation\" list. That alone is worth coming out for.It\\'s necessary viewing, for trans and cis folk alike-and not just because I\\'m in it, too!A thoughtfully crafted film that puts underheard voices first. Completely aside from its backstory and dietary moral, it is a piece of wondrously immersive filmmaking that invites us to slow down and consider life at its most elemental and - though this may sound corny in reference to a farm animal - humane.While Gunda exhibits tremendous empathy, it does not indulge in anthropomorphism or court sentimental responses. To further preempt such mawkishness, Kossakovsky shot it in b/w. The pink body of a piglet is thus less likely to elicit awwww than awe.Gunda may not technically be a silent film, but its expression through movement functions much the same way, with our minds filling in experiential gaps to create something that feels narratively whole.You\\'ll feel like you\\'re making new best friends when you watch \"Gunda.\" It\\'s as pure a farmyard experience as a movie can conceivably be.Gunda personalizes these animals without humanizing them, and evacuates explicit humanity without ignoring its clear impact.Beyond its value as a meditation on animal captivity and cruelty... this is a film that pays attention to things we\\'ve long neglected and to in-between interludes we have forgotten how to see.What it does express, in the most unadorned and ultimately affecting of ways, is the sentience of these creatures.\"Gunda\" ultimately falls somewhere between banal and profound. Maybe it\\'s both. Kossokovsky... has grounded the nature film in a new movie terrain that for all its restraint, oozes empathy.A cinematic triumph of porcine poetry.The film is ultimately about bigger issues, to do with respect for the planet, but Kossakovsky has found a brilliant, emotional and daring way into those concerns.It\\'s a film that requires a lot of patience, but if you can get under it\\'s spell then it has a hypnotic quality.Few films capture the intense, sticky bond between a mother and her offspring so simply and wrenchingly, without remark, or convey the knowledge that we carnivores are devouring souls with every bite of bacon.Pigs are smart... An improbably beautiful work of barnyard art, Gunda figures that we\\'re smart too.The message comes through loud and painfully clear, no dubbed voices required.Sublimely beautiful and profoundly moving, it offers you the opportunity to look - at animals, yes, but also at qualities that are often subordinated in narratively driven movies, at textures, shapes and light.Kossakosky\\'s achingly beautiful black-and-white documentary is ground-breaking and wondrous for its intimacy,There\\'s no dialogue; we just watch the animals go about their lives while we experience the quietly dawning recognition that these animals have real lives.By the time the credits roll on the film, we realize we\\'ve been watching not so much a sketch of the lives of farm animals as a threnody for their deaths.Kossakovsky isn\\'t out to lecture or confront his audience with moral rhetoric or shock imagery, but to encourage understanding of farm animal life as it\\'s being lived - not just valuable at the point of death.A landmark film from a bracingly original filmmaker. As director Alison Ellwood shows in her briskly entertaining documentary -- The Go-Go\\'s -- the band\\'s members can explain away, with enormous charm, the naked ambition that made them the most successful \"girl group\" ever.The doc\\'s goal: Don\\'t think of the Go-Go\\'s as a bit of Reagan-era nostalgia, the musical equivalent of a Rubik\\'s cube. Think of them as a first-tier, kick-ass rock group, period, full stop, the end. Mission accomplished.\"The Go-Go\\'s\" is an entertaining and well-put together package on a musical group who should command the respect of their male peers.Anyone with even a passing interest in the Go-Go\\'s... must watch Alison Ellwood\\'s documentary.Watching the film, it\\'s pure pleasure to witness such scrappy exuberance, such mayhem so enthusiastically pursued.They still Got the Beat.This film isn\\'t always \"upbeat,\" but it is honest. It\\'s the story of a still underrated, pioneering rock band - who, like a lot of pioneers, sometimes got a little lost.A testament to sisterhood and how age, wisdom, and an understanding of how rare and special certain relationships are can bust through even the most hardest grudges.What makes this documentary feel specific and alive is the way she vividly takes us back to the early days, letting The Go-Go\\'s reminisce about their beginnings and tell their own stories.In her contemporary interviews with the band members, Ellwood has captured them all at a time of life when they are prepared to look back at their youthful selves with a mixture of generosity and clear-eyed candor.The tale of The Go-Go\\'s carries echoes of any number of stars who became sensations only to experience the darker side of achieving those dreams. Still, it\\'s presented as only the people who lived it could -- whose lips, happily, aren\\'t sealed.\"The Go-Go\\'s\" benefits enormously from its determination to interview Olavarria and others who were left eating the band\\'s dust.The indescribable chemistry between Carlisle, Wiedlin, Schock, Caffey, and Valentine is fully on display throughout the doc.This film plays like a \"Behind the Music\" episode with more artifice, and that\\'s not necessarily a compliment. It\\'s too bad, because there\\'s so much that could have been mined here.Like the elements of a good hit song, it all comes together and seems fresh. It may sound like something you\\'ve heard before, but it also sounds new.A music bio-doc that embodies the rebellious spirit of its subject.The Go-Go\\'s sometimes lacks a personal touch, and too often waltzes through as a by-the-numbers music documentary, but certainly serves as a monument to a seminal group.Tackles the seminal all-female \\'80s rock band with such honesty and effervescence that it not only rises above that clich??d, almost telegraphed arc but transcends the ranks of other music documentaries.\"The Go-Go\\'s\" is a classically crafted rock doc that shows you, more or less, everything you want to know about this game-changing, grinning-and-bopping, God-do-you-miss-the-\\'80s-or-what? punk-pop band.Backed by a wealth of video footage, archival photographs and gig posters, Ellwood captures the determination with which the band thrust itself forward, neither glossing over nor digging too deep into the hint of ruthlessness with which early members... Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds is an absorbing look into how this cosmic phenomenon has inspired human civilisation itself.A film that can be a bit dry when Oppenheimer leads the scientific discussion but that springs back to life when Herzog the filmmaker allows his awe to come through the camera.Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds is an awestruck movie about awe.Its subject matter is contemplative and alluring, fearsome and wondrous, yet often inherently inconclusive, made more so by the musings and dissections of the film\\'s eclectic array of voices - including Herzog\\'s.It\\'s about as transportive as documentaries get.The film ranges far afield and interviews an engaging and eclectic mix of people.Anyone else would pursue the obvious angle. How long until the big one? Despite his cheery fatalism, Herzog proves less interested in apocalypse than in how meteors have shaped all prior history.The film\\'s true focus, however, is those who love meteorites and are excited to share that passion, their ardor burning as brightly as those streaks through the sky.One of the most striking effects here occurs whenever Werner Herzog and Clive Oppenheimer slow down the film\\'s often-hectic pace to let viewers ponder the sheer beauty of the imagery.This film is charming and educational enough, but it\\'s not especially profound; it flirts with big ideas about the origins of life and the twin cycles of creation and destruction but doesn\\'t really let them sink in.[Fireball] suffers from a general malaise.Fireball is relatively conventional... However, the engagingly idiosyncratic nature of Herzog\\'s ruminative narration and his probing questions of experts elicit thoughtful and extensive replies as well as welcome humor.Fireball gives [Werner Herzog] another chance to play in familiar but satisfying territory.Herzog\\'s documentaries have grown shaggier and more episodic over time, but this one is often lost in space without him on screen as its star.Come for the opportunity to hear Werner Herzog utter the words \"a beach resort so godforsaken you want to cry,\" but stay for the German director\\'s journey into the world of meteors in this half-amusing, half-illuminating documentary.An elegant fusion of science and awe. This is an extraordinary story and the thorough manner in which White has assembled the material brings one of the most unusual political assassinations ever carried out vividly to life.Well-worth checking out.[White] spins the arrest of Siti Aisyah and Doan Thi Huong - economic migrants from Indonesia and Vietnam respectively - into a parable about political corruption.It\\'s like a John le Carr?? thriller for the Instagram generation. Only it\\'s real.It\\'s a fascinating news story, but the film\\'s additional, if entertaining speculations remain just that.Siti and Duan\\'s story is an extraordinary snapshot of 15-minute celebrity innocently craved, and then accidentally achieved for all the wrong reasons.A curious film, a no-frills documentary about a crime of outlandish aspect.What an extraordinary story of sexism, violence, diplomatic bad faith and dishonesty on an international scale.This film is fairly straightforward and low-key in its execution, but the access is excellent - and what a story it tells.As riveting and preposterous as a Robert Ludlum novel, Ryan Murphy\\'s terrific documentary of the bizarre assassination of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un\\'s half brother is a spellbinding...It will shock, enrage and enlighten.Observant and ultimately pretty riveting.I appreciate that the filmmakers don\\'t sensationalize what is ultimately a very tragic and upsetting story.Still, while \"Assassins\" may be somewhat unsatisfying as a true-crime story, it\\'s provocative as an examination of power.[White] deftly untangles the different webs of meaning and implication, political, social and otherwise, to draw us into Siti and Doan\\'s worlds.Its main virtues are a wild story and a stealth sense of outrage.As you watch the movie, I promise that there are moments when your jaw will drop.Another \\'can you believe it\\' story that I suspect will captivate people wherever they can see it.\"Assassins\" finds its pulse in the fact that it was filmed in media res, before the dust had settled on this strange ordeal, and the perspective of Siti\\'s counsel proves invaluable during the trial.It\\'s a Kafka-esque and sometimes darkly comic tale of deception and exploitation that makes for a smartly assembled and eminently topical film that arrives at a crucial juncture in world affairs... Seeing what happened to Furie and his chill stoner frog dude... will likely make your blood run cold. It sure makes for a chillingly effective internet-era cautionary tale.This engrossing documentary follows the character\\'s gentle creator, Matt Furie, as he tries to reclaim his frog from the hatemongers.Thorough, well-researched investigation ... but with the humor, playfulness and creativity that matches its material and main character.Things are likely to get (even) worse before they get better, but if you want to fight something, first you have to understand it. Feels Good Man does just that, and it\\'s pretty darn entertaining, too.Not content to string together talking head interviews, the movie uses art and animation to find a cinematic equivalent for Pepe\\'s evolution from a quirky cartoon animal into a weapon.At its best, the movie is a vertiginous, head-slapping examination of the tangible, unpredictable consequences of making art.Jones uses Furie\\'s story, and some gorgeous animation, as a wonderfully succinct window into the way social media has changed the country.That the democratization of the internet has opened a doorway for fascist ideologies to openly quash democratic ones is an irony that isn\\'t lost on the film.The blind optimism with which Furie believes that incels and radicals will finally get bored of Pepe and just sort of hand him back will break your heart.Feels Good, Man is a shocking doc so chock-full of disorienting details...that it feels unbearably long at just 92-minutes.Jones demonstrates an insatiable curiosity about his subject, speaking with everyone from a former Trump campaign insider to a collector of Rare Pepes to an expert on the occult.A beacon of internet literacy.While \"Feels Good Man\" is stretched a bit too thin to really pierce what it feels like to sit there and watch the world corrupt your art, Furie\\'s general powerlessness is endemic to this story in ways that have nothing to do with his personality.Most of the lines it draws through online trainwreck culture and shifts in mainstream culture are clear, harrowing and appropriately cautionary.\"Feels Good Man\" offers an inside peek at the internet\\'s growing ability to affect and shape modern society, which often makes the film a nightmare about extremism and technology. It makes a very good case that you should be interested in Zappa\\'s work.If there is one American musician who was overdue for a comprehensive documentary, that\\'s Zappa -- and this one doesn\\'t disappoint. It\\'s as messy as his music in parts, but that fits.Key to the success of the film is the editing, a pinballing assault of free association, claymation and gleeful profanity, which goes some way towards recreating what it must have been like to spend time inside Zappa\\'s head.Winter has simply collated the resulting audio and video recordings into more than two hours of slightly sophomoric Zap-tastic musings on the pointlessness of commercial music, the need to fight the system and the tediousness of mainstream success.Winter has created a fascinating watch.Winter\\'s film deserves a lot of credit for appreciating the full, intrepid range of Zappa\\'s music, though penetrating the leathery mystery of his personality is perhaps a tall order.Winter\\'s doc can\\'t hold a candle to any of the musician\\'s best songs or climactic symphonies... The good news is that Winter seems to have recognized that from the start, and made a certain peace with the low ceiling of his film\\'s conventional structure.Frank Zappa hates this film.This compelling, entertaining and no-B.S. documentary, directed by Alex Winter and produced by Frank\\'s son Ahmet, gives a full picture of the Italian American musical iconoclast.Captures its subject\\'s spirit without tipping into mere hero worship.A complex and surprisingly satisfying portrait of an artist who defiantly marched to the beat of a different drummer (or two).\"Zappa\" foregrounds the laudable and often astonishing aspects of the man\\'s work and personality.Roughly chronological in shape - there\\'s a charming wealth of home movies from Zappa\\'s childhood and adolescence - \"Zappa\" spends much time with the early Mothers of Invention of the mid-to-late 1960s...I appreciate this documentary more than I actually liked it, which is the same way that I felt about Frank Zappa.I appreciated that this wasn\\'t a complete deification of the man... I learned a lot about him that I didn\\'t already know, and it is a good L.A. story, too.There\\'s little fault that even the most hardcore fan could find with Mr. Winter\\'s film, which accomplishes the acrobatic act of doing justice to a figure like Frank Zappa.As \"Zappa\" makes clear, Frank Zappa spent his whole career keeping himself unique, often to his credit and occasionally to his detriment. Winter\\'s movie does the same, in a way that does justice to a guy who\\'s not easy to do justice to.Winter gives Zappa pride of place among the most important composers of the 20th century, sharing some extraordinary performances of his little-known classical work.It\\'s a multimedia immersion, filled with rare footage of Zappa from his teenage years on and assembled with the loving dexterity we\\'ve come to expect from Alex Winter as a filmmaker.In \"Zappa,\" this legendary artist\\'s uncompromising nature is bracing, bold and utterly refreshing.'"
